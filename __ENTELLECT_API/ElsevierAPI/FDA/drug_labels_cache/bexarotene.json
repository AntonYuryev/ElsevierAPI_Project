    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Bexarotene gel, 1% contains bexarotene and is intended for topical application only. Bexarotene is a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name is 4-[1-(3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows: Bexarotene is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 348.478 and a molecular formula of C 24 H 28 O 2 . It is practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol, sparingly soluble in acetone, soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, slightly soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble in vegetable oil. Bexarotene gel, 1% is a clear gelled solution containing 1.0% (w/w) bexarotene in a base of dehydrated alcohol, polyethylene glycol 400, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and butylated hydroxytoluene.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. Pharmacokinetics General Plasma concentrations of bexarotene were determined during clinical studies in patients with CTCL or following repeated single or multiple-daily dose applications of bexarotene gel, 1% for up to 132 weeks. Plasma bexarotene concentrations were generally less than 5 ng/mL and did not exceed 55 ng/mL. However, only two patients with very intense dosing regimens (> 40% BSA lesions and QID dosing) were sampled. Plasma bexarotene concentrations and the frequency of detecting quantifiable plasma bexarotene concentrations increased with increasing percent body surface area treated and increasing quantity of bexarotene gel applied. The sporadically observed and generally low plasma bexarotene concentrations indicated that, in patients receiving doses of low to moderate intensity, there is a low potential for significant plasma concentrations following repeated application of bexarotene gel. Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied (see PRECAUTIONS: Protein Binding ). The uptake of bexarotene by organs or tissues has not been evaluated. Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma following oral administration of bexarotene: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene gel is unknown. Elimination The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus following oral administration of bexarotene. Neither bexarotene nor its metabolites were excreted in urine in appreciable amounts. SPECIAL POPULATIONS Elderly, Gender, Race: Because of a large number of immeasurable plasma concentrations (< 1ng/mL), any potential pharmacokinetic differences between Special Populations could not be assessed. Pediatric: Studies to evaluate bexarotene pharmacokinetics in the pediatric population have not been conducted (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use ). Renal Insufficiency: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene gel in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of an orally administered dose), but because renal insufficiency can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal insufficiency (see PRECAUTIONS: Renal Insufficiency ). Hepatic Insufficiency: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene gel in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Because less than 1% of the dose of oral bexarotene is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance (see PRECAUTIONS: Hepatic Insufficiency ). DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal studies to evaluate drug interactions with bexarotene or bexarotene gel have been conducted. Bexarotene oxidative metabolites appear to be formed through cytochrome P450 3A4. Drugs that affect levels or activity of cytochrome P450 3A4 may potentially affect the disposition of bexarotene. Concomitant gemfibrozil was associated with increased bexarotene concentrations following oral administration of bexarotene."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene gel was evaluated for the treatment of patients with early stage (Stage IA-IIA) CTCL in one multicenter, open-label, clinical trial as well as in a Phase I-II program (dose-seeking trials with different response criteria than the multicenter trial). These clinical studies enrolled a total of 117 patients. In the multicenter, open-label clinical trial, bexarotene gel was evaluated for the treatment of patients with early stage CTCL who were refractory to, intolerant to, or reached a response plateau for at least six months on at least two prior therapies. The study was conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia and enrolled a total of 50 patients; 46% of these patients were male, 80% were Caucasian, and the median age was 64 years (range 13 to 85). Bexarotene gel was also evaluated for the treatment of patients with CTCL in a U.S. Phase I-II program involving patients with early stage CTCL. This program enrolled a total of 67 patients; 55% of these patients were male, 85% were Caucasian, and the median age was 61 years (range 30 to 87). In the multicenter, open-label clinical trial, considering prior systemic, irradiation, and topical treatments, patients had been exposed to a median of three prior therapies (range 2 to 7). All patients failed at least two treatments; the majority (68%) of patients were either refractory to two or more therapies or were refractory to one therapy and intolerant to at least one therapy. Patients were treated with Bexarotene gel 1% for a planned 16-week period with an option to continue provided that no unacceptable toxicity was occurring. Tumor response was assessed in the multicenter study by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. New cutaneous lesions or tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations were not considered in response or disease progression assessments. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of the index lesions, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. Bexarotene gel produced an overall response rate of 26% (13/50) with a corresponding exact 95% confidence interval from 14.6% to 40.3% by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity. For the Stage IA and IB patients, the response rate was 28% (13/47) with a corresponding exact 95% confidence interval from 15.6% to 42.6%. For the Stage II patients the response rate was 0% (0/3). Two percent of patients (1/50) had a clinical complete response. The median time to best response on the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (n=13) was 85 days (range: 36 to 154). The rate of relapse in responding patients by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity was 23% (3/13) over a median observation period of 149 days (range 56 to 342). Fourteen patients developed new lesions in untreated areas (14/50; 28%). Four patients developed clinically abnormal lymph nodes (\u2265 1cm diam) (4/50; 8%). One patient developed a cutaneous tumor (1/50; 2%). The Phase I-II program (dose-seeking trials with different response criteria than the multicenter trial) was supportive of the multicenter study results."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Bexarotene gel, 1% is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to bexarotene or other components of the product. PREGNANCY Bexarotene gel, 1% may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Bexarotene gel must not be given to a pregnant woman or a woman who intends to become pregnant. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking bexarotene gel, bexarotene gel must be stopped immediately and the woman given appropriate counseling. Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no-effect oral dose in rats was 1 mg/kg/day. Plasma bexarotene concentrations in patients with CTCL applying bexarotene gel, 1% were generally less than one hundredth the C max associated with dysmorphogenesis in rats, although some patients had C max levels that were approximately one eighth the concentration associated with dysmorphogenesis in rats. Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene gel is used. The possibility that a woman of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time therapy is instituted should be considered. A negative pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, beta-HCG) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/L should be obtained within one week prior to bexarotene gel therapy, and the pregnancy test must be repeated at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene gel. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while applying bexarotene gel and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. Bexarotene gel therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene gel should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced."

      "PRECAUTIONS Pregnancy . See CONTRAINDICATIONS General: Bexarotene gel should be used with caution in patients with a known hypersensitivity to other retinoids. No clinical instances of cross-reactivity have been noted. Vitamin A Supplementation: In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. Photosensitivity: Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. There were no reports of photosensitivity in patients in the clinical studies. Patients should be advised to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during the use of bexarotene gel. Information for Patients Please see accompanying \u201c Patient\u2019s Instructions for Use \u201d DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients who are applying bexarotene gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET ( N,N -diethyl- m -toluamide), a common component of insect repellent products. An animal toxicology study showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as part of the formulation. No formal studies to evaluate drug interactions with bexarotene have been conducted. Bexarotene oxidative metabolites appear to be formed through cytochrome P450 3A4. On the basis of the metabolism of bexarotene by cytochrome P450 3A4, concomitant ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and grapefruit juice could increase bexarotene plasma concentrations. Similarly, based on data that gemfibrozil increases bexarotene concentrations following oral bexarotene administration, concomitant gemfibrozil could increase bexarotene plasma concentrations. However, due to the low systemic exposure to bexarotene after low to moderately intense gel regimens (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), increases that occur are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to result in adverse effects. No drug interaction data are available on concomitant administration of bexarotene gel and other CTCL therapies. RENAL INSUFFICIENCY No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene gel in patients with renal insufficiency. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway for bexarotene (<1% of an orally administered dose), but because renal insufficiency can result in significant protein binding changes, and bexarotene is >99% protein bound, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal insufficiency. HEPATIC INSUFFICIENCY No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene gel in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Because less than 1% of the dose of oral bexarotene is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. PROTEIN BINDING Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied. CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Long-term studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic potential of bexarotene have not been conducted. Bexarotene was not mutagenic to bacteria (Ames assay) or mammalian cells (mouse lymphoma assay). Bexarotene was not clastogenic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice). No formal fertility studies were conducted with bexarotene. Bexarotene caused testicular degeneration when oral doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day were given to dogs for 91 days. Use in Nursing Mothers It is not known whether bexarotene is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical studies of bexarotene gel, 62% were under 65 years and 38% were 65 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene gel cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene gel were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of bexarotene gel has been assessed in clinical studies of 117 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene gel for up to 172 weeks. In the multicenter open-label study, 50 patients with CTCL received bexarotene gel for up to 98 weeks. The mean duration of therapy for these 50 patients was 199 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence at the application site of at least 10% in patients with CTCL were rash, pruritus, skin disorder, and pain. Adverse events leading to dose reduction or study drug discontinuation in at least two patients were rash, contact dermatitis, and pruritus. Of the 49 patients (98%) who experienced any adverse event, most experienced events categorized as mild (9 patients, 18%) or moderate (27 patients, 54%). There were 12 patients (24%) who experienced at least one moderately severe adverse event. The most common moderately severe events were rash (7 patients, 14%) and pruritus (3 patients, 6%). Only one patient (2%) experienced a severe adverse event (rash). In the patients with CTCL receiving bexarotene gel, adverse events reported regardless of relationship to study drug at an incidence of \u22655% are presented in Table 1. A similar safety profile for bexarotene gel was demonstrated in the Phase I-II program. For the 67 patients enrolled in the Phase I-II program, the mean duration of treatment was 436 days (range 12 to 1,203 days).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Systemic toxicity following acute overdosage with topical application of bexarotene gel is unlikely because of low systemic plasma levels observed with normal therapeutic doses. There is no specific antidote for overdosage. There has been no experience with acute overdose of bexarotene gel in humans. Any overdose with bexarotene gel should be treated with supportive care for the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Bexarotene gel, 1% should be initially applied once every other day for the first week. The application frequency should be increased at weekly intervals to once daily, then twice daily, then three times daily and finally four times daily according to individual lesion tolerance. Generally, patients were able to maintain a dosing frequency of two to four times per day. Most responses were seen at dosing frequencies of two times per day and higher. If application site toxicity occurs, the application frequency can be reduced. Should severe irritation occur, application of drug can be temporarily discontinued for a few days until the symptoms subside. See CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy . Sufficient gel should be applied to cover the lesion with a generous coating. The gel should be allowed to dry before covering with clothing. Because unaffected skin may become irritated, application of the gel to normal skin surrounding the lesions should be avoided. In addition, do not apply the gel near mucosal surfaces of the body. A response may be seen as soon as four weeks after initiation of therapy but most patients require longer application. With continued application, further benefit may be attained. The longest onset time for the first response among the responders was 392 days based on the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity in the multicenter study. In clinical trials, bexarotene gel, 1% was applied for up to 172 weeks. Bexarotene gel, 1% should be continued as long as the patient is deriving benefit. Occlusive dressings should not be used with bexarotene gel, 1%. BEXAROTENE GEL, 1% IS A TOPICAL THERAPY AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR SYSTEMIC USE.

      "Bexarotene (bex ar' oh teen) Gel, 1% Patient\u2019s Instructions for Use (For Topical Use Only) To help you get the full benefits from this medicine, you should read this leaflet carefully and ask your doctor to explain anything you do not understand. What are the most important things I should know about bexarotene gel? Do not use bexarotene gel if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. Bexarotene gel may harm your fetus (unborn baby). You should contact your doctor immediately if you believe or suspect you are pregnant while you are using bexarotene gel and until one month after you stop using bexarotene gel. If you are capable of becoming pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test, within one week before you start bexarotene gel therapy and monthly while you are using bexarotene gel, confirming you are not pregnant. You must use effective contraception (birth control) continuously starting one month before beginning treatment with bexarotene gel until one month after you stop using bexarotene gel. It is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used together. If you are male and your partner is pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant, you should discuss with your doctor the precautions you should take. What is bexarotene gel? Bexarotene gel contains bexarotene. Bexarotene gel belongs to a class of medicines known as retinoids. What are the uses for bexarotene gel? This medicine is used to treat the skin problems arising from a disease called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. Your health care provider has prescribed bexarotene for the topical treatment of the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), or mycosis fungoides (MF), lesions (sometimes referred to as patches or plaques) on your skin. Your doctor must instruct you on the proper use of bexarotene gel. The following instructions will help you successfully begin and continue your treatment. Do not use bexarotene gel if you are allergic to this medicine. Do not use bexarotene gel if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. If you have any of the following conditions, make sure you have discussed them with your doctor before you start to take this medicine. If you are breast feeding. If you are allergic to retinoid medications (for example: Accutane \u00ae [isotretinoin], Soriatane \u00ae [acitretin], Tegison \u00ae [etretinate], Vesinoid \u00ae [tretinoin]). When should you be extra careful while using bexarotene gel? Because vitamin A in large doses may cause some side effects which are similar to those seen in patients applying bexarotene gel, do not take more than the recommended daily dietary allowance of vitamin A (4,000 to 5,000 International Units). If you take vitamins, check the label to see how much vitamin A they contain. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Your skin may become more sensitive to sunlight while using this medicine. Minimize exposure to sunlight and do not use a sunlamp. WARNINGS For external use only. DO NOT apply the gel on or near mucosal surfaces of the body such as eyes, nostrils, mouth, lips, vagina, tip of the penis, rectum, or anus. DO NOT use insect repellents containing DEET ( N,N -diethyl- m -toluamide) or other products containing DEET while using bexarotene gel. Keep out of reach of children. Product contains alcohol and should be kept away from open flame. DO NOT use bexarotene gel if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Speak to your health care provider if you have any questions or need more information. HOW TO APPLY Apply bexarotene gel to your CTCL lesions using a clean washed finger. Place a generous coating of gel over the entire surface of each lesion. You should not apply gel to the healthy skin around the lesion. The extra effort you take in carefully applying the gel only to the area of the CTCL lesion will help to lessen any irritation or redness that may occur. Proper application should leave some gel visible on the surface of the lesion when you are finished with the application. Immediately following application, wipe the finger(s) you have used to apply the gel with a disposable tissue and wash your hands using soap and water. Allow five (5) to ten (10) minutes for the gel to dry before covering a treated area with clothing. A mild non-deodorant soap is recommended when bathing or showering. If you apply bexarotene gel after your shower or bath, you should wait 20 minutes before application. WHEN TO APPLY Bexarotene gel should be applied at an initial frequency of once every other day for the first week. The frequency of application should then be increased as tolerated at weekly intervals to once daily, then twice daily, then three times daily, and finally four times daily. Your health care provider may instruct you to apply bexarotene gel at a different frequency. YOU SHOULD AVOID\u2026 You should avoid applying bexarotene gel to areas of healthy skin around a CTCL lesion. Exposure of healthy skin to bexarotene gel may cause unnecessary irritation or redness. You should avoid showering, bathing, or swimming until at least three (3) hours after any application, if possible. You should avoid covering the CTCL lesions treated with bexarotene gel with any bandage or material other than loose clothing. You should avoid prolonged exposure of the treated area to sunlight or other ultraviolet (UV) light (such as tanning lamps). You should avoid the use of other topical products on your treated CTCL lesions. You should avoid scratching the treated areas. WHAT SIDE EFFECTS DOES BEXAROTENE GEL HAVE? While using bexarotene gel, you may experience some local effects such as redness, itching, burning, irritation, and scaling at the area of application. In clinical trials, the majority of these effects were mild or moderate, but some patients did experience more severe rash, itching, irritation, and inflammation. A few patients discontinued treatment due to these types of effects. Should these or other effects become troublesome to you, consult your health care provider. He or she can provide information on how to manage these effects. All medications have side effects. You should call your physician regarding any questions or concerns you may have when using bexarotene gel. HOW QUICKLY CAN I EXPECT BEXAROTENE GEL TO WORK? Be patient. Bexarotene gel takes time to work. In clinical trials, some patients began to respond as early as 4 weeks, but most patients did not experience their best response until 48 to 62 weeks of treatment. Do not stop treatment at the first sign of improvement. Continue to use bexarotene gel as instructed by your health care provider. OTHER INFORMATION The opening of the bexarotene gel tube is covered by a metal safety seal. If this seal has been punctured or is not visible when you first open the package, DO NOT USE this tube and promptly return the product to your pharmacy or place of purchase. To open, use the pointed portion of the cap to puncture the metal safety seal. Always use the cap to close the tube tightly after each use. Store at room temperature. Keep away from heat or flame.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. ( 5.1 , 5.11 ) \u2022 Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene therapy can cause hypothyroidism. Monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene dose or interrupt as indicated. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1,200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non\u2011CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and monitor patients during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1,000 to <3,000 WBC x 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene developed leukopenia of less than 1,000 WBC x 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6) ]. 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1,000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2 to 4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills , cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia. Digestive: constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, colitis, dyspepsia, cheilitis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, liver failure, and melena.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene 300 or 150 mg/m 2 /day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively)."

Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered.

      "Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u25cfmin/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone . Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [see Data ] . Bexarotene must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If bexarotene is used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied. Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7\u2011 oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u25cfmin/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene was evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene is indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m 2 /day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%). The median duration of response in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median duration of response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 55 days, 119.0 days and 118.0 days respectively. The median time to cutaneous tumor response (the time to cutaneous tumor response for a given subject is defined as the time interval from the first day of bexarotene treatment to the time of the first observation when the subject with subsequent confirmation of response meets criteria for CR, CCR or PR) in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 85 days, 98 days and 117.5 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median time to cutaneous tumor response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 87 days, 57 days and 57 days respectively. In the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 77.5, 115.5, and 88.0 days, respectively. In the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression was 203.0 days based on the CA and 86.0 days based on percent BSA involvement; no subject in this treatment group had cutaneous tumor progression based on the PGA."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. ( 5.1 , 5.11 ) Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. ( 5.3 ) Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene therapy can cause hypothyroidism. monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed ( 5.5 ) Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene dose or interrupt as indicated. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of greater than or equal to 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1,200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and patients monitor during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to less than 3000 WBC x 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to less than or equal to 15,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6) ]. 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Laboratory Tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) include: Hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, headache, hypothyroidism, asthenia, leukopenia, rash, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipidemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2 to 4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia.

Patients are considered to have had a Grade 3 or 4 value if either of the following occurred: a) Value becomes Grade 3 or 4 during the study; b) Value is abnormal at baseline and worsens to Grade 3 or 4 on study, including all values beyond study drug discontinuation, as defined in data handling conventions. 3 The denominator used to calculate the incidence rates for fasting Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides were N=75 for the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group and N=44 for the >300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group. The safety profile from the one post-approval trial with 59 subjects was generally comparable to that of the pivotal trials with the exception of serious adverse events hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia and bone marrow failure which were observed more frequently in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (greater than or equal to 800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene 300 or 150 mg/m 2 /day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene Gemfibrozil: Concomitant administration of bexarotene and gemfibrozil resulted in increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Laboratory Test Interference CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [see Data] . Bexarotene must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If bexarotene is used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose)."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Bexarotene capsules contain bexarotene, a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name of bexarotene is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows: Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C 24 H 28 O 2 . It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP. Each bexarotene capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene for oral administration. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, polyethylene glycol 400, polysorbate 20, and povidone K30. The capsule shell contains gelatin, glycerin, sorbitol, and titanium dioxide. The imprinting ink contains black iron oxide, propylene glycol, and may also contain hypromellose 2910, and polyvinyl acetate phthalate. 1"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (greater than 99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (less than 1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged greater than or equal to 65 years and 343 patients aged less than 65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (less than 1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u2022min/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone. Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene was evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene is indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m 2 /day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%). The median duration of response in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median duration of response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 55 days, 119.0 days and 118.0 days respectively. The median time to cutaneous tumor response (the time to cutaneous tumor response for a given subject is defined as the time interval from the first day of bexarotene treatment to the time of the first observation when the subject with subsequent confirmation of response meets criteria for CR, CCR or PR) in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 85 days, 98 days and 117.5 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median time to cutaneous tumor response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 87 days, 57 days and 57 days respectively. In the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 77.5, 115.5, and 88.0 days, respectively. In the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression was 203.0 days based on the CA and 86.0 days based on percent BSA involvement; no subject in this treatment group had cutaneous tumor progression based on the PGA."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Bexarotene (bex ar ' oh teen) Capsules What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene capsules? Bexarotene capsules can cause serious side effects, including major birth defects to an unborn baby, if taken during pregnancy. For females who can become pregnant: You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with bexarotene capsules. Do not take bexarotene capsules if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test, within one week before you start bexarotene capsules, and each month during treatment with bexarotene capsules to make sure that you are not pregnant. You must use two effective forms of birth control together starting one month before you begin treatment with bexarotene capsules, during treatment, and for one month after stopping bexarotene capsules. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and other hormonal forms of birth control may not be effective if used with bexarotene capsules. At least one of the forms of birth control that you choose should not contain hormones. Talk to your healthcare provider about what forms of birth control may be right for you during treatment with bexarotene capsules. You should start taking bexarotene capsules on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions about when to start bexarotene capsules. Call your healthcare provider right away, if you become pregnant or think that you are pregnant during treatment with bexarotene capsules, and for one month after you stop taking bexarotene capsules. For males: You must use a condom with female partners who are pregnant, might be pregnant, or who are able to become pregnant, during treatment with bexarotene capsules and for at least one month after your last dose. What are bexarotene capsules? Bexarotene capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat the skin problems that happen with a type of cancer called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after treatment with at least one other type of medicine by mouth or injection, did not work or has stopped working. It is not known if bexarotene capsules are safe and effective in children. Who should not take bexarotene capsules? Do not take bexarotene capsules: if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. (5.1, 5.11) Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if suspected. (5.2) Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. (5.3) Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene therapy can cause hypothyroidism. monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed (5.5) Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene dose or interrupt as indicated. (5.6) Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. (5.10) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene [see Drug Interactions (7)]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and patients monitor during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to <3000 WBC x 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6)]. 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Laboratory Tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) include: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, headache, hypothyroidism, asthenia, leukopenia, rash, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc., at 1-866-495-8330 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2 to 4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills , cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia. Digestive: constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, colitis, dyspepsia, cheilitis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, liver failure, and melena.

Patients are considered to have had a Grade 3 or 4 value if either of the following occurred: a) Value becomes Grade 3 or 4 during the study; b) Value is abnormal at baseline and worsens to Grade 3 or 4 on study, including all values beyond study drug discontinuation, as defined in data handling conventions. 3 The denominator used to calculate the incidence rates for fasting Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides were N=75 for the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group and N=44 for the >300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group. The safety profile from the one post-approval trial with 59 subjects was generally comparable to that of the pivotal trials with the exception of serious adverse events hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia and bone marrow failure which were observed more frequently in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene 300 or 150 mg/m 2 /day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects[31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively)."

Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended. Effect of bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [see Data] . Bexarotene must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If bexarotene is used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6-and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6-and 7oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u2022min/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone . Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6-and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6-and 7oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u2022min/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone . Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene was evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene is indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m 2 /day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%). The median duration of response in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median duration of response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 55 days, 119.0 days and 118.0 days respectively . The median time to cutaneous tumor response (the time to cutaneous tumor response for a given subject is defined as the time interval from the first day of bexarotene treatment to the time of the first observation when the subject with subsequent confirmation of response meets criteria for CR, CCR or PR) in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 85 days, 98 days and 117.5 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median time to cutaneous tumor response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 87 days, 57 days and 57 days respectively. In the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 77.5, 115.5, and 88.0 days, respectively. In the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression was 203.0 days based on the CA and 86.0 days based on percent BSA involvement; no subject in this treatment group had cutaneous tumor progression based on the PGA."

For females who can become pregnant: You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with bexarotene. Do not take bexarotene capsules if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test, within one week before you start bexarotene, and each month during treatment with bexarotene to make sure that you are not pregnant. You must use two effective forms of birth control together starting one month before you begin treatment with bexarotene, during treatment, and for one month after stopping bexarotene . Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and other hormonal forms of birth control may not be effective if used with bexarotene. At least one of the forms of birth control that you choose should not contain hormones. Talk to your healthcare provider about what forms of birth control may be right for you during treatment with bexarotene. You should start taking bexarotene capsules on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period . Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions about when to start bexarotene.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. ( 5.1 , 5.11 ) Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. ( 5.3 ) Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene therapy can cause hypothyroidism. monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed ( 5.5 ) Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene dose or interrupt as indicated. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, Cholestasis, and Hepatic Failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and monitor patients during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to <3000 WBC \u00d7 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene . Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC \u00d7 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6) ]. 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Upsher-Smith Laboratories, LLC at 1-855-899-9180 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2 ). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene (see Table 3 ) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2 to 4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene Gemfibrozil: Concomitant administration of bexarotene and gemfibrozil resulted in increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Laboratory Test Interference CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [ see Data ]. Bexarotene must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4% and of miscarriage is 15 to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If bexarotene is used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Bexarotene capsules are a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name of bexarotene is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows: Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C 24 H 28 O 2 . It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP. Each bexarotene capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene for oral administration. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate and povidone. The capsule shell contains gelatin, glycerin, sorbitol, titanium dioxide and water. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene capsules, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied. Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The coadministration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u2219min/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0\u201324 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone . Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was coadministered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was coadministered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The coadministration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene was evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene is indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Patient Information Bexarotene (bek-sar\u00b4ah-t\u0113n) Capsules What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene? Bexarotene can cause serious side effects, including major birth defects to an unborn baby, if taken during pregnancy. For females who can become pregnant: You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with bexarotene. Do not take bexarotene if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test, within one week before you start bexarotene, and each month during treatment with bexarotene to make sure that you are not pregnant. You must use two effective forms of birth control together starting one month before you begin treatment with bexarotene, during treatment, and for one month after stopping bexarotene . Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and other hormonal forms of birth control may not be effective if used with bexarotene. At least one of the forms of birth control that you choose should not contain hormones. Talk to your healthcare provider about what forms of birth control may be right for you during treatment with bexarotene. You should start taking bexarotene on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period . Follow your healthcare provider's instructions about when to start bexarotene. Call your healthcare provider right away, if you become pregnant or think that you are pregnant during treatment with bexarotene, and for one month after you stop taking bexarotene. For males : You must use a condom with female partners who are pregnant, might be pregnant, or who are able to become pregnant, during treatment with bexarotene and for at least one month after your last dose. What is bexarotene? Bexarotene is a prescription medicine used to treat the skin problems that happen with a type of cancer called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after treatment with at least one other type of medicine by mouth or injection, did not work or has stopped working. It is not known if bexarotene is safe and effective in children. Who should not take bexarotene? Do not take bexarotene: if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. See \" What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene? \" if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in bexarotene. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in bexarotene. Before taking bexarotene, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had problems with your pancreas, including pancreatitis have or have had gallbladder problems have or have had liver problems have thyroid problems have diabetes have high levels of fats (lipids) called cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood have cataracts or a history of cataracts drink alcohol are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. See \" What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene? \" are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if bexarotene passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed during treatment with bexarotene. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with bexarotene. Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using bexarotene with certain other medicines can affect each other. How should I take bexarotene? Take bexarotene exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how many bexarotene capsules to take each day. Your healthcare provider may change your daily dose of bexarotene as needed to treat your CTCL or if you get certain side effects. You should not change your dose unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Take your dose of bexarotene 1 time a day with a meal. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before you start bexarotene and during treatment to check for side effects. What should I avoid while taking bexarotene? Limit your exposure to sunlight and artificial types of sunlight. Bexarotene can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and you can get sunburn. Limit the amount of vitamin A that you take during treatment with bexarotene. Large doses of vitamin A may cause side effects that are similar to side effects that can happen in people who take bexarotene. What are the possible side effects of bexarotene? Bexarotene can cause serious side effects, including: See \" What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene? \" Increased levels of fats (lipids) called cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood are common with bexarotene, but can also be serious. Your healthcare provider may prescribe you medicines to treat high cholesterol or triglycerides levels, reduce your dose, temporarily stop treatment or completely stop treatment with bexarotene if you have this problem. Inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis). Bexarotene can sometimes cause pancreatitis that comes on suddenly (acute), and that can lead to death. Your risk of developing acute pancreatitis may be greater if you: have had pancreatitis in the past high levels of fats in your blood that are not controlled drink large amounts of alcohol have gallbladder problems have diabetes that is not controlled take certain medicines that can increase the amount of triglycerides in your blood take medicines that can harm your pancreas Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop signs or symptoms of pancreatitis during treatment with bexarotene, including: nausea that will not go away vomiting stomach-area (abdominal) or back pain Liver problems, including liver failure. Bexarotene can cause increased liver function blood test results, or liver problems that can lead to death. Thyroid problems (hypothyroidism) are common with bexarotene. Your healthcare provider may prescribe thyroid hormone treatment for you if needed. Low white blood cell count is common with bexarotene, but may sometimes be severe. New or worse cataracts. Tell your healthcare provider about any changes in your vision during treatment with bexarotene. You may need to have an eye examination. Risk of low blood sugar in people who have diabetes. Bexarotene can interact with certain medicines used to treat diabetes, such as insulin, sulfonylurea medicines, and thiazolinedione medicines. If you have diabetes, talk to your healthcare provider about your diabetes medicines and your risk for low blood sugar if you take bexarotene. The most common side effects of bexarotene include: headache asthenia rash nausea infection stomach-area (abdomen) pain swelling of your hands, arms, feet or legs dry skin These are not all the possible side effects of bexarotene.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. (5.1, 5.11) Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if suspected. (5.2) Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. (5.3) Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene therapy can cause hypothyroidism. Monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed. (5.5) Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene dose or interrupt as indicated. (5.6) Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. (5.10) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and patients monitor during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to <3000 WBC x 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6) ] . 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Laboratory Tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10%) include: hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, headache, hypothyroidism, asthenia, leukopenia, rash, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2 to 4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia.

Patients are considered to have had a Grade 3 or 4 value if either of the following occurred: a) Value becomes Grade 3 or 4 during the study; b) Value is abnormal at baseline and worsens to Grade 3 or 4 on study, including all values beyond study drug discontinuation, as defined in data handling conventions. 3 The denominator used to calculate the incidence rates for fasting Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides were N=75 for the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group and N=44 for the >300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group. The safety profile from the one post-approval trial with 59 subjects was generally comparable to that of the pivotal trials with the exception of serious adverse events hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia and bone marrow failure which were observed more frequently in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene 300 or 150 mg/m 2 /day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene Gemfibrozil: Concomitant administration of bexarotene and gemfibrozil resulted in increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Laboratory Test Interference CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [see Data] . Bexarotene must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If bexarotene is used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Bexarotene capsules contain bexarotene, a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name of bexarotene is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows: Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C 24 H 28 O 2 . It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP. Each bexarotene capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene for oral administration. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, polyethylene glycol 400, polysorbate 20 and povidone. The capsule shell contains gelatin, glycerin, purified water, sorbitol sorbitan solution, and titanium dioxide. The imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol and shellac glaze. Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied. Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u2022min/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone. Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene was evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene is indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m 2 /day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%). The median duration of response in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median duration of response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 55 days, 119.0 days and 118.0 days respectively . The median time to cutaneous tumor response (the time to cutaneous tumor response for a given subject is defined as the time interval from the first day of bexarotene treatment to the time of the first observation when the subject with subsequent confirmation of response meets criteria for CR, CCR or PR) in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 85 days, 98 days and 117.5 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median time to cutaneous tumor response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 87 days, 57 days and 57 days respectively. In the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 77.5, 115.5, and 88.0 days, respectively. In the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression was 203.0 days based on the CA and 86.0 days based on percent BSA involvement; no subject in this treatment group had cutaneous tumor progression based on the PGA."

      "Patient Information Bexarotene (beks-AIR-oh-teen) Capsules What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene capsules? Bexarotene capsules can cause serious side effects, including major birth defects to an unborn baby, if taken during pregnancy. For females who can become pregnant: You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with bexarotene capsules. Do not take bexarotene capsules if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Your healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test, within one week before you start bexarotene capsules, and each month during treatment with bexarotene capsules to make sure that you are not pregnant. You must use two effective forms of birth control together starting one month before you begin treatment with bexarotene capsules, during treatment, and for one month after stopping bexarotene capsules. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and other hormonal forms of birth control may not be effective if used with bexarotene capsules. At least one of the forms of birth control that you choose should not contain hormones. Talk to your healthcare provider about what forms of birth control may be right for you during treatment with bexarotene capsules. You should start taking bexarotene capsules on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions about when to start bexarotene capsules. Call your healthcare provider right away, if you become pregnant or think that you are pregnant during treatment with bexarotene capsules, and for one month after you stop taking bexarotene capsules. For males: You must use a condom with female partners who are pregnant, might be pregnant, or who are able to become pregnant, during treatment with bexarotene capsules and for at least one month after your last dose. What are bexarotene capsules?

Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene capsules. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene capsule therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene capsule therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene capsules. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene capsules [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene capsules; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene capsules and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene capsules if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and monitor patients during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to <3000 WBC x 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene capsules developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene capsules. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene capsule therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene capsules daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene capsules and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene capsules who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene capsules as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene capsules. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene capsules. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene capsule therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene capsule therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 ) ]. A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 ) ]. 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene capsule therapy."

The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene capsules for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene capsule dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene capsules as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene capsules as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2-4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection. Cardiovascular: hemorrhage, hypertension, angina pectoris, right heart failure, syncope, and tachycardia. Digestive: constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, colitis, dyspepsia, cheilitis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, liver failure, and melena. Hemic and Lymphatic: eosinophilia, thrombocythemia, coagulation time increased, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.

Patients are considered to have had a Grade 3 or 4 value if either of the following occurred: a) Value becomes Grade 3 or 4 during the study; b) Value is abnormal at baseline and worsens to Grade 3 or 4 on study, including all values beyond study drug discontinuation, as defined in data handling conventions. 3 The denominator used to calculate the incidence rates for fasting Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides were N=75 for the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group and N=44 for the >300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group. The safety profile from the one post-approval trial with 59 subjects was generally comparable to that of the pivotal trials with the exception of serious adverse events hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia and bone marrow failure which were observed more frequently in the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene capsule 300 or 150 mg/m 2 /day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene Capsules Gemfibrozil: Concomitant administration of bexarotene capsules and gemfibrozil resulted in increases in plasma concentrations of bexarotene. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene capsules is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene Capsules on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene capsules is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Laboratory Test Interference CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene capsule therapy.",
      "Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene capsules did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u25cfmin/mL) with bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene capsules alone. Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene capsules and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [see Data] . Bexarotene capsules must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene capsules, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2-4% and of miscarriage is 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7-17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene capsules. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/L within one week prior to bexarotene capsule therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene capsules. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene capsules is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene capsule therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene capsules should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene capsules and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene capsules, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene capsules cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene capsules were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If bexarotene capsules are used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose)."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Bexarotene capsules contain bexarotene, a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name of bexarotene is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows: Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C 24 H 28 O 2 . It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP. Each bexarotene capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene for oral administration. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, nitrogen, butylated hydroxyanisole, glycerin, hydrolyzed gelatin, medium chain triglyceride, Shellac glaze, FD&C red #40, FD&C blue #1, FD&C yellow #6, propylene glycol, simethicone, polyethylene glycol 400, polysorbate 20, povidone, sorbitol, 1,4-sorbitan, mannitol, soy lecithin and titanium dioxide. structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u00df, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene capsules, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene capsules binding have not been studied. Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene capsules in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene capsules did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u25cfmin/mL) with bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene capsules alone. Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene capsules and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene capsules (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene capsules were evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene capsules are indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene capsules showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m 2 /day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%). The median duration of response in the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively. While in the bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median duration of response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 55 days, 119.0 days and 118.0 days respectively. The median time to cutaneous tumor response (the time to cutaneous tumor response for a given subject is defined as the time interval from the first day of bexarotene capsule treatment to the time of the first observation when the subject with subsequent confirmation of response meets criteria for CR, CCR or PR) in the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 85 days, 98 days and 117.5 days respectively. While in the bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median time to cutaneous tumor response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 87 days, 57 days and 57 days respectively. In the bexarotene capsule 300 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 77.5, 115.5, and 88.0 days, respectively. In the bexarotene capsule 150 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression was 203.0 days based on the CA and 86.0 days based on percent BSA involvement; no subject in this treatment group had cutaneous tumor progression based on the PGA."

Bexarotene capsules can cause serious side effects, including major birth defects to an unborn baby, if taken during pregnancy. For females who can become pregnant: \u2022 You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with bexarotene capsules. \u2022 Do not take bexarotene capsules if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test, within one week before you start bexarotene capsules, and each month during treatment with bexarotene capsules to make sure you are not pregnant. \u2022 You must use two effective forms of birth control together starting one month before you begin treatment with bexarotene capsules, during treatment, and for one month after stopping bexarotene capsules . Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) and other hormonal forms of birth control may not be effective if used with bexarotene capsules. At least one of the forms of birth control that you choose should not contain hormones. Talk to your healthcare provider about what forms of birth control may be right for you during treatment with bexarotene capsules. \u2022 You should start taking bexarotene capsules on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period . Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions about when to start bexarotene capsules. \u2022 Call your healthcare provider right away, if you become pregnant or think that you are pregnant during treatment with bexarotene capsules, and for one month after you stop taking bexarotene capsules. For males: \u2022 You must use a condom with female partners who are pregnant, might be pregnant, or who are able to become pregnant, during treatment with bexarotene capsules and for at least one month after your last dose. What are bexarotene capsules? Bexarotene capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat the skin problems that happen with a type of cancer called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after treatment with at least one other type of medicine by mouth or injection, did not work or has stopped working. It is not known if bexarotene capsules are safe and effective in children. Who should not take bexarotene capsules? Do not take bexarotene capsules: \u2022 if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. See \u201c What is the most important information I should know about bexarotene capsules? \u201d \u2022 if you are allergic to bexarotene or any of the ingredients in bexarotene capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in bexarotene capsules. Before taking bexarotene capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u2022 have or have had problems with your pancreas, including pancreatitis \u2022 have or have had gallbladder problems \u2022 have or have had liver problems \u2022 have thyroid problems \u2022 have diabetes \u2022 have high levels of fats (lipids) called cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood \u2022 have cataracts or a history of cataracts \u2022 drink alcohol \u2022 are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or think you may be pregnant. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about bexarotene capsules?\u201d \u2022 are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if bexarotene passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed during treatment with bexarotene capsules. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with bexarotene capsules. Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using bexarotene capsules with certain other medicines can affect each other. How should I take bexarotene capsules? \u2022 Take bexarotene capsules exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will tell you how many bexarotene capsules to take each day. Your healthcare provider may change your daily dose of bexarotene capsules as needed to treat your CTCL or if you get certain side effects. You should not change your dose unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Take your dose of bexarotene capsules 1 time a day with a meal. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests before you start bexarotene capsules and during treatment to check for side effects. What should I avoid while taking bexarotene capsules? \u2022 Limit your exposure to sunlight and artificial types of sunlight. Bexarotene can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight and you can get sunburn. \u2022 Limit the amount of vitamin A that you take during treatment with bexarotene capsules.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperlipidemia: Bexarotene causes elevations in blood lipids. Obtain baseline values, monitor, and manage elevations during therapy by dose reduction, interruption, discontinuation and/or lipid lowering therapy. (5.1, 5.11) Pancreatitis: Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if suspected. (5.2) Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure: Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene and evaluate if liver chemistry tests exceed three times the upper limit of normal values. (5.3) Hypothyroidism: Bexarotene therapy can cause hypothyroidism. Monitor and replace thyroid hormone if needed. (5.5) Neutropenia: Monitor for neutropenia. Reduce bexarotene dose or interrupt as indicated. (5.6) Photosensitivity: Minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light during treatment. (5.10) 5.1 Hyperlipidemia Bexarotene induces substantial elevations in lipids in most patients. About 70% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of \u2265300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had fasting triglyceride levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. About 55% had values over 800 mg/dL with a median of about 1200 mg/dL in those patients. Cholesterol elevations above 300 mg/dL occurred in approximately 60% and 75% of patients with CTCL who received an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to less than 25 mg/dL were seen in about 55% and 90% of patients receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day or greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, respectively, of bexarotene. Monitor lipid changes and treat abnormalities during therapy. The effects on triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol were reversible with cessation of therapy, and could generally be mitigated by dose reduction and/or concomitant antilipemic therapy. Perform fasting blood lipid determinations before bexarotene therapy is initiated and weekly until the lipid response to bexarotene is established, which usually occurs within two to four weeks, and monitor at eight week intervals thereafter. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to initiating bexarotene therapy. Maintain triglyceride levels below 400 mg/dL to reduce the risk of clinical sequelae [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . If fasting triglycerides are elevated or become elevated during treatment, institute antilipemic therapy, and if necessary, reduce or interrupt the dose of bexarotene. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 60% of patients were given lipid lowering drugs. Atorvastatin was used in 48% (73/152) of patients with CTCL. Because of a potential drug-drug interaction, avoid gemfibrozil use with bexarotene [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including a fatal case, has been reported in four patients with CTCL and in six patients with non-CTCL cancers treated with bexarotene; the cases were associated with marked elevations of fasting serum triglycerides, the lowest being 770 mg/dL in one patient. One patient with advanced non-CTCL cancer died of pancreatitis. Interrupt bexarotene and evaluate if pancreatitis is suspected. Patients with CTCL who have risk factors for pancreatitis (e.g., prior pancreatitis, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, excessive alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, biliary tract disease, and medications known to increase triglyceride levels or to be associated with pancreatic toxicity) may be at greater risk for pancreatitis associated with bexarotene [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.3 Hepatotoxicity, cholestasis, and hepatic failure Bexarotene caused elevations in liver chemistry tests (LFTs) in 5% (AST), 2% (ALT), and 0% (bilirubin) in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In contrast, with an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, the incidence of LFT elevations was higher at 7% (SGOT/AST), 9% (SGPT/ALT), and 6% (bilirubin). Two patients developed cholestasis, including one patient who died of liver failure. In clinical trials, elevated LFTs resolved within one month in 80% of patients following a decrease in dose or discontinuation of therapy. Obtain baseline LFTs and monitor LFTs after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, at least every eight weeks thereafter during treatment. Interrupt or discontinue bexarotene if test results exceed three times the upper limit of normal values for AST, ALT, or bilirubin. 5.4 Hypothyroidism Bexarotene induces hypothyroidism in about half of all patients treated by causing a reversible reduction in levels of thyroid hormone (total thyroxine [total T4]) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The incidence of decreases in TSH and total T4 were about 60% and 45%, respectively, in patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse event in 29% of patients. Consider treatment with thyroid hormone supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, 37% of patients were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Obtain baseline thyroid function tests and patients monitor during treatment. 5.5 Neutropenia Leukopenia in the range of 1000 to <3000 WBC x 10 6 /L occurred in 18% of patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene. Patients receiving an initial dose greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene had an incidence of leukopenia of 43%. No patient with CTCL treated with bexarotene developed leukopenia of less than 1000 WBC x 10 6 /L. The usual time to onset of leukopenia was four to eight weeks after initiating bexarotene. The leukopenia observed in most patients was predominately neutropenia. In the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia, respectively, was 12% and 4%. The leukopenia and neutropenia experienced during bexarotene therapy resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment, on average within 30 days in 93% of the patients with CTCL and 82% of patients with non-CTCL cancers. Leukopenia and neutropenia were rarely associated with severe sequelae or serious adverse events. Obtain complete blood counts (CBC) at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.6 Cataracts Posterior subcapsular cataracts occurred in preclinical toxicity studies in rats and dogs administered bexarotene daily for 6 months. New cataracts or worsening of previous cataracts occurred in 15 of 79 patients who were monitored with serial slit lamp examinations. Because of the high prevalence and rate of cataract formation in older patient populations, the relationship of bexarotene and cataracts cannot be determined in the absence of an appropriate control group. Patients treated with bexarotene who experience visual difficulties should have an appropriate ophthalmologic evaluation. 5.7 Vitamin A Supplementation Hazard In clinical studies, patients were advised to limit vitamin A intake to \u226415,000 IU/day. Because of the relationship of bexarotene to vitamin A, patients should be advised to limit vitamin A supplements to avoid potential additive toxic effects. 5.8 Hypoglycemia Risk in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In patients using insulin, agents enhancing insulin secretion (e.g., sulfonylureas), or insulin-sensitizers (e.g., thiazolidinedione class), based on the mechanism of action, bexarotene could enhance the action of these agents, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia has not been associated with the use of bexarotene as monotherapy. 5.9 Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. In vitro assays indicate that bexarotene is a potential photosensitizing agent. Phototoxicity manifested as sunburn and skin sensitivity to sunlight occurred in patients who were exposed to direct sunlight while receiving bexarotene. Advise patients to minimize exposure to sunlight and artificial ultraviolet light while receiving bexarotene. 5.10 Laboratory Tests Before initiating bexarotene therapy, obtain a CBC, fasting lipid profile, liver function tests, and a thyroid profile. Fasting triglycerides should be normal or normalized with appropriate intervention prior to therapy. Monitor lab tests during bexarotene therapy as described above. Hyperlipidemia usually occurs within the initial two to four weeks. Therefore, weekly lipid determinations are recommended during this interval. Subsequently, in patients not hyperlipidemic, determinations can be performed less frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . A white blood cell count with differential should be obtained at baseline and periodically during treatment. Baseline liver function tests should be obtained and should be carefully monitored after one, two and four weeks of treatment initiation, and if stable, periodically thereafter during treatment. Baseline thyroid function tests should be obtained and then monitored during treatment as indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6) ] . 5.11 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions CA125 assay values in patients with ovarian cancer may be increased by bexarotene therapy."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of bexarotene has been evaluated in two clinical trials of 152 patients with CTCL who received bexarotene for up to 97 weeks and in 352 patients in other trials. The mean duration of therapy for the 152 patients with CTCL was 166 days. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence of at least 10% in patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene are shown in Table 2. The events at least possibly related to treatment are lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides, elevated total and LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol), hypothyroidism, headache, asthenia, rash, leukopenia, anemia, nausea, infection, peripheral edema, abdominal pain, and dry skin. Most adverse events occurred at a greater incidence in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day (see Table 2). Adverse reactions leading to bexarotene dose reduction or discontinuation in at least two patients were hyperlipemia, neutropenia/leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue/lethargy, hypothyroidism, headache, liver function test abnormalities, rash, pancreatitis, nausea, anemia, allergic reaction, muscle spasm, pneumonia, and confusion. The NCI Grade 3 and NCI Grade 4 adverse reactions reported in two or more patients with CTCL treated at an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene (see Table 3) were hypertriglyceridemia, pruritus, headache, peripheral edema, leukopenia, rash, and hypercholesteremia. Most of these moderately severe or severe adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients treated at starting doses of greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day than in patients treated at a starting dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day. In patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevations in triglycerides and total cholesterol was 28% and 25%, respectively (Table 4). In contrast, in patients with CTCL receiving greater than 300 mg/m 2 /day, the incidence of NCI Grade 3 or 4 elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol was 45% and 45%, respectively. Other Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 3. In addition to the 152 patients enrolled in the two CTCL trials, 352 patients received bexarotene as monotherapy for various advanced malignancies at doses from 5 mg/m 2 /day to 1000 mg/m 2 /day. The common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were similar to those seen in patients with CTCL. In the 504 patients (CTCL and non-CTCL) who received bexarotene as monotherapy, drug-related serious adverse reactions that were fatal, in one patient each, were acute pancreatitis, subdural hematoma, and liver failure. In the patients with CTCL receiving an initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene, adverse reactions reported at an incidence of less than 10% and not included in Tables 2 to 4 or discussed in other parts of labeling and possibly related to treatment were as follows: Body as a Whole: chills, cellulitis, chest pain, breast pain, sepsis, and monilia infection.

Patients are considered to have had a Grade 3 or 4 value if either of the following occurred: a) Value becomes Grade 3 or 4 during the study; b) Value is abnormal at baseline and worsens to Grade 3 or 4 on study, including all values beyond study drug discontinuation, as defined in data handling conventions. 3 The denominator used to calculate the incidence rates for fasting Total Cholesterol and Triglycerides were N=75 for the 300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group and N=44 for the >300 mg/m 2 /day initial dose group. The safety profile from the one post-approval trial with 59 subjects was generally comparable to that of the pivotal trials with the exception of serious adverse events hypertriglyceridemia, neutropenia and bone marrow failure which were observed more frequently in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group. Severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265800 mg/dL) was not seen in any subject in the lower dosage arm. The most common AEs by preferred term in either the bexarotene 300 or 150 mg/m 2 /day treatment group were as follows: hypertriglyceridemia (18 subjects [62.1%] and 17 subjects [56.7%], respectively); hypothyroidism (15 subjects [51.7%] and 13 subjects [43.3%], respectively); headache (9 subjects [31.0%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); hypercholesterolemia (8 subjects [27.6%] and 7 subjects [23.3%], respectively); neutropenia (7 subjects [24.1%] and 2 subjects [6.7%], respectively); and skin exfoliation (5 subjects [17.2%] and 5 subjects [16.7%], respectively). Higher percentage of subjects in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group experienced SAEs (13 subjects [44.8%] vs 11 subjects [36.7%], respectively. Of the SAEs of special interest, there were more events in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group of bone marrow failure (3 [10.3%] vs 1 [3.3%, respectively]), neutropenia (3 [10.3%] vs 0 [0%], respectively), and of hypertriglyceridemia (9 [31%] vs 2 [6.7%], respectively).

Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with bexarotene is not recommended. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene may be an inducer for the CYP3A4 enzymes, and may reduce plasma concentrations of other substrates metabolized by CYP3A4. Drug products which may be affected include oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended for a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that a non-hormonal contraception be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Bexarotene, a retinoid, can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy. Bexarotene was teratogenic and caused developmental mortality in rats following oral administration during organogenesis [see Data] . Bexarotene must not be given to a pregnant female or a female who intends to become pregnant. If pregnancy does occur during treatment with bexarotene, immediately discontinue the drug and advise the pregnant female of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Bexarotene caused malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during days 7 to 17 of gestation. Developmental abnormalities included incomplete ossification at 4 mg/kg/day and cleft palate, depressed eye bulge/microphthalmia, and small ears at 16 mg/kg/day. The plasma AUC of bexarotene in rats at 4 mg/kg/day is approximately one third the AUC in humans at the recommended daily dose. At doses greater than 10 mg/kg/day, bexarotene caused developmental mortality. The no effect dose for fetal effects in rats was 1 mg/kg/day (producing an AUC approximately one sixth of the AUC at the recommended human daily dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of bexarotene in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from bexarotene, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with bexarotene. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Obtain a negative serum pregnancy test (e.g., serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-HCG]) with a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/L within one week prior to bexarotene therapy. Obtain another pregnancy test at monthly intervals while the patient remains on bexarotene. Contraception Females Bexarotene can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when bexarotene is used. Effective contraception must be used for one month prior to the initiation of therapy, during therapy and for at least one month following discontinuation of therapy; it is recommended that two reliable forms of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Bexarotene can potentially induce metabolic enzymes and thereby theoretically reduce the plasma concentrations of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Thus, if treatment with bexarotene is intended in a female with reproductive potential, it is strongly recommended that one of the two reliable forms of contraception should be non-hormonal. Bexarotene therapy should be initiated on the second or third day of a normal menstrual period. No more than a one month supply of bexarotene should be given to the patient so that the results of pregnancy testing can be assessed and counseling regarding avoidance of pregnancy and birth defects can be reinforced. Males Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant, or who could become pregnant must use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking bexarotene and for at least one month after the last dose of drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of bexarotene in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total patients with CTCL in clinical trials of bexarotene, 64% were 60 years or older, while 33% were 70 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between patients 70 years or older and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to bexarotene cannot be ruled out. Responses to bexarotene were observed across all age group decades, without preference for any individual age group decade. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment is expected to lead to decreased clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If bexarotene is used in patients with hepatic impairment, monitor for signs of toxicity that may be due to increased exposure."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Bexarotene capsules contain bexarotene, a member of a subclass of retinoids that selectively activate retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These retinoid receptors have biologic activity distinct from that of retinoic acid receptors (RARs). The chemical name of bexarotene is 4-[1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3,5,5,8,8-pentamethyl-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl] benzoic acid, and the structural formula is as follows: Bexarotene is an off-white to white powder with a molecular weight of 348.48 and a molecular formula of C 24 H 28 O 2 . It is insoluble in water and slightly soluble in vegetable oils and ethanol, USP. Each bexarotene capsule contains 75 mg of bexarotene for oral administration. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: butylated hydroxyanisole, polyethylene glycol 400, polysorbate 20 and povidone. The capsule shell contains gelatin, glycerin, purified water, sorbitol sorbitan solution, and titanium dioxide. The imprinting ink contains ammonium hydroxide, iron oxide black, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, propylene glycol and shellac glaze. Structural Formula"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Bexarotene selectively binds and activates retinoid X receptor subtypes (RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2, RXR\u03b3). RXRs can form heterodimers with various receptor partners such as retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator activator receptors (PPARs). Once activated, these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation. Bexarotene inhibits the growth in vitro of some tumor cell lines of hematopoietic and squamous cell origin. It also induces tumor regression in vivo in some animal models. The exact mechanism of action of bexarotene in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Terminal half-life of bexarotene is approximately seven hours. Studies in patients with advanced malignancies show approximate single dose linearity within the therapeutic range. Absorption After oral administration of bexarotene, bexarotene is absorbed with a T max of about two hours. Plasma bexarotene AUC and C max values resulting from a 75 to 300 mg dose were 35% and 48% higher, respectively, after a fat-containing meal than after a glucose solution. Distribution Bexarotene is highly bound (>99%) to plasma proteins. The plasma proteins to which bexarotene binds have not been elucidated, and the ability of bexarotene to displace drugs bound to plasma proteins and the ability of drugs to displace bexarotene binding have not been studied. Elimination Metabolism Four bexarotene metabolites have been identified in plasma: 6- and 7-hydroxy-bexarotene and 6- and 7-oxo-bexarotene. In vitro studies suggest that cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major cytochrome P450 responsible for formation of the oxidative metabolites and that the oxidative metabolites may be glucuronidated. The oxidative metabolites are active in in vitro assays of retinoid receptor activation, but the relative contribution of the parent and any metabolites to the efficacy and safety of bexarotene is unknown. Excretion The renal elimination of bexarotene and its metabolites was examined in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose). Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Age: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 232 patients aged \u226565 years and 343 patients aged <65 years, age has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Body Weight and Gender: Based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis of data for 614 patients with a weight range of 26 to 145 kg, the bexarotene apparent clearance increases with increasing body weight. Gender has no statistically significant effect on bexarotene pharmacokinetics. Race: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis of data for 540 Caucasian and 44 Black patients, bexarotene pharmacokinetics are similar in Blacks and Caucasians. There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of bexarotene for other races. Renal Impairment: No formal studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with renal impairment. Urinary elimination of bexarotene and its known metabolites is a minor excretory pathway (<1% of administered dose), but because renal impairment can result in significant protein binding changes, pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment: No specific studies have been conducted with bexarotene in patients with hepatic impairment. Because less than 1% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged and there is in vitro evidence of extensive hepatic contribution to bexarotene elimination, hepatic impairment would be expected to lead to greatly decreased clearance. Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on Bexarotene CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers: In a clinical study, concomitant administration of multiple doses of ketoconazole with bexarotene did not alter bexarotene plasma concentrations. This suggests that bexarotene elimination is not dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism. Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin: The co-administration of paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) plus carboplatin (at a dose expected to achieve an AUC of 6 mg\u2022min/mL) with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) increased the exposure to bexarotene (AUC 0-24 and C max ) by 2-fold compared to bexarotene alone. Atorvastatin: Bexarotene concentrations were not affected by concomitant atorvastatin administration. Effect of Bexarotene on Other Drugs Bexarotene did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4. In vitro data suggested a potential for bexarotene to inhibit CYP2C8 and induce CYP3A4. Atorvastatin: The exposure (AUC) to atorvastatin (a substrate for CYP3A4) decreased by half when atorvastatin was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Tamoxifen: Based on interim data, concomitant administration of bexarotene and tamoxifen resulted in approximately a 35% decrease in plasma concentrations of tamoxifen, possibly through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene. Paclitaxel: The exposure (AUC) to paclitaxel (a substrate for CYP3A4 and CYP2C8) decreased by 19% when paclitaxel (200 mg/m 2 IV dose over 3 hours) was co-administered with bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily). Carboplatin: The co-administration of bexarotene (400 mg/m 2 orally once daily) had no effect on the exposure to free or total carboplatin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Bexarotene was evaluated in two clinical trials in 152 patients with advanced and early stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in two multicenter, open-label, historically-controlled clinical trials conducted in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia. The advanced disease patients had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (median of two, range one to six prior systemic therapies) and had been treated with a median of five (range 1 to 11) prior systemic, irradiation, and/or topical therapies. Early disease patients were intolerant to, had disease that was refractory to, or had reached a response plateau of six months on, at least two prior therapies. The patients entered had been treated with a median of 3.5 (range 2 to 12) therapies (systemic, irradiation, and/or topical). The two clinical trials enrolled a total of 152 patients, 102 of whom had disease refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy, 90 with advanced disease and 12 with early disease. This is the patient population for whom bexarotene is indicated. Patients were initially treated with a starting dose of 650 mg/m 2 /day with a subsequent reduction of starting dose to 500 mg/m 2 /day. Neither of these starting doses was tolerated, and the starting dose was then reduced to 300 mg/m 2 /day. If, however, a patient on 300 mg/m 2 /day of bexarotene showed no response after eight or more weeks of therapy, the dose could be increased to 400 mg/m 2 /day. Tumor response was assessed in both trials by observation of up to five baseline-defined index lesions using a Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Disease Severity (CA). This endpoint was based on a summation of the grades, for all index lesions, of erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation, and area of involvement. Also considered in response assessment was the presence or absence of cutaneous tumors and extracutaneous disease manifestations. All tumor responses required confirmation over at least two assessments separated by at least four weeks. A partial response was defined as an improvement of at least 50% in the index lesions without worsening, or development of new cutaneous tumors or non-cutaneous manifestations. A complete clinical response required complete disappearance of all manifestations of disease, but did not require confirmation by biopsy. At the initial dose of 300 mg/m 2 /day, 1/62 (1.6%) of patients had a complete clinical tumor response and 19/62 (30%) of patients had a partial tumor response. The rate of relapse (25% increase in CA or worsening of other aspects of disease) in the 20 patients who had a tumor response was 6/20 (30%) over a median duration of observation of 21 weeks, and the median duration of tumor response had not been reached. Responses were seen as early as 4 weeks and new responses continued to be seen at later visits. In one post-approval clinical trial with a total of 59 subjects (29 in 300 mg/m 2 /day dose group and 30 in the 150 mg/m 2 /day dose), the objective response rate was higher in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group than in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group with respect to the CA (34.5% vs 23.3%), Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) (37.9% vs 20.0%), and percent BSA involvement (34.5% vs 23.3%). The median duration of response in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 86.5 days, 72.0 days and 60.0 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median duration of response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 55 days, 119.0 days and 118.0 days respectively . The median time to cutaneous tumor response (the time to cutaneous tumor response for a given subject is defined as the time interval from the first day of bexarotene treatment to the time of the first observation when the subject with subsequent confirmation of response meets criteria for CR, CCR or PR) in the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 85 days, 98 days and 117.5 days respectively. While in the bexarotene 150 mg/m 2 /day group the median time to cutaneous tumor response based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 87 days, 57 days and 57 days respectively. In the bexarotene 300 mg/m 2 /day group, the median time to cutaneous tumor progression based on the CA, PGA, and percent BSA involvement was 77.5, 115.5, and 88.0 days, respectively.
