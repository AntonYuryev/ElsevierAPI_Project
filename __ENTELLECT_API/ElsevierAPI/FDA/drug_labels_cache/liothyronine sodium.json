    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets Liothyronine sodium tablets has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium tablets dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium tablets may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium tablets dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium tablets has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium tablets therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Overdosage (10) ] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium tablets are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash ( 6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets ( 7 ) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (see Tables 1 \u2013 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium tablets by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium tablets at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium tablets are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium tablets increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium tablets dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium tablets may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium tablets may result in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium tablets may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer liothyronine sodium orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) \u2022 When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) \u2022 Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) \u2022 Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Overdosage (10) ] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Greenstone LLC at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium ( 7 ) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 \u2013 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin/Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens/Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings (2.1) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism (2.2) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer (2.3) and for thyroid suppression test (2.4) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient\u2019s response (2.5) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status (2.6) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, coadministered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Preexisting Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium tablets, dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium tablets may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient\u2019s status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient\u2019s clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation (2.3, 5.1, 8.5) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. (5.2) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets treatment (5.3) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. (5.4) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy (5.5) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose (5.6) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium tablets dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium tablets are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (see Tables 1 \u2013 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium tablets by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium tablets at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone (2.2, 8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from postmarketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from postmarketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient\u2019s clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6)] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant, while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. Important Information Inform patients that the liothyronine in liothyronine sodium tablets are intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally replacement therapy is to be taken for life. Inform patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. If patents are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), their clotting status should be checked frequently. Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist if they are taking liothyronine sodium tablets prior to any surgery. Adverse Reactions Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation. ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment. ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy. ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over-or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Pharma Inc., at 1-866-924-6266 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium ( 7 ) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium tablets are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."
    ],
    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues."

    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )].

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].

If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Dosing and Administration Instruct patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should only be taken as directed by their healthcare provider. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant, while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. Important Information Inform patients that the liothyronine in liothyronine sodium tablets is intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally replacement therapy is to be taken for life. Inform patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. If patents are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), their clotting status should be checked frequently. Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist if they are taking liothyronine sodium tablets prior to any surgery. Adverse Reactions Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event [see Adverse Reactions (6)] .

Liothyronine sodium tablets are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism (2.2) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient\u2019s response (2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ), and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets Liothyronine sodium tablets has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium tablets dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient\u2019s status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient\u2019s clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. (5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium tablets dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium tablets [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with Liothyronine sodium tablets therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory: dyspnea Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic: hair loss, flushing Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium tablets are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets ( 7 ) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium tablets by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium tablets at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti- inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine sodium tablets are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium tablets increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium tablets dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium tablets may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. liothyronine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium tablets may result in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium tablets may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liothyronine sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient\u2019s clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] . Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actionsthrough control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2 to 1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( ) and for thyroid suppression test ( ) \u2022 When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( ) \u2022 Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see , , ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see and . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( , , ) \u2022 Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( ) \u2022 Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( ) \u2022 Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( ) \u2022 Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( ) \u2022 Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see and ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see , )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see , )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see and ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see and ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings (2.1) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism (2.2) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer (2.3) and for thyroid suppression test (2.4) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient\u2019s response (2.5) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status (2.6) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, coadministered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Preexisting Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium tablets, dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium tablets may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient\u2019s status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient\u2019s clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation (2.3, 5.1, 8.5) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. (5.2) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets treatment (5.3) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. (5.4) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy (5.5) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose (5.6) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium tablets dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (see Tables 1 \u2013 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium tablets by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium tablets at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone (2.2, 8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from postmarketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from postmarketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient\u2019s clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.6)] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Dosing and Administration Instruct patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should only be taken as directed by their healthcare provider. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant, while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. Important Information Inform patients that the liothyronine in liothyronine sodium tablets are intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally replacement therapy is to be taken for life. Inform patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. If patents are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), their clotting status should be checked frequently. Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist if they are taking liothyronine sodium tablets prior to any surgery. Adverse Reactions Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Inform patients that partial hair loss may occur rarely during the first few months of liothyronine sodium therapy; this is usually temporary [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

      "DESCRIPTION Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing tetraiodothyronine (T 4 , levothyroxine) sodium or triiodothyronine (T 3 , liothyronine) sodium or both. T 4 and T 3 are produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. T 4 contains four iodine atoms and is formed by the coupling of two molecules of diiodotyrosine (DIT). T 3 contains three atoms of iodine and is formed by the coupling of one molecule of DIT with one molecule of monoiodotyrosine (MIT). Both hormones are stored in the thyroid colloid as thyroglobulin and released into the circulation. The major source of T 3 has been shown to be peripheral deiodination of T 4 . T 3 is bound less firmly than T 4 in the serum, enters peripheral tissues more readily, and binds to specific nuclear receptor(s) to initiate hormonal, metabolic effects. T 4 is the prohormone which is deiodinated to T 3 for hormone activity. Thyroid hormone preparations belong to two categories: (1) natural hormonal preparations derived from animal thyroid, and (2) synthetic preparations. Natural preparations include desiccated thyroid and thyroglobulin. Desiccated thyroid is derived from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (either beef or hog thyroid), and thyroglobulin is derived from thyroid glands of the hog. Liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) contains liothyronine (L-triiodothyronine or L-T 3 ), a synthetic form of a natural thyroid hormone, as the sodium salt. The structural and empirical formulas and molecular weight of liothyronine sodium are given below. In euthyroid patients, 25 mcg of liothyronine is equivalent to approximately 1 grain of desiccated thyroid or thyroglobulin and 0.1 mg of L-thyroxine. Each mL of liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) in amber glass vials contains, in sterile non-pyrogenic aqueous solution, liothyronine sodium equivalent to 10 mcg of liothyronine; alcohol, 6.8% by volume; anhydrous citric acid, 0.175 mg; ammonia, 2.19 mg, as ammonium hydroxide; Water for Injection, USP.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Thyroid hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. In vitro studies indicate that T 3 increases aerobic mitochondrial function, thereby increasing the rates of synthesis and utilization of myocardial high-energy phosphates. This, in turn, stimulates myosin ATPase and reduces tissue lactic acidosis. Thus, thyroid hormones exert a profound influence on virtually every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system. While the source of levothyroxine (T 4 ) and some triiodothyronine (T 3 ) is via secretion from the thyroid gland, it is now well-established that approximately 80% of circulating T 3 arises predominantly by way of the extrathyroidal conversion of T 4 . The membrane-bound enzyme responsible for this reaction is iodothyronine 5\u2019-deiodinase. Activity of the enzyme is greatest in the liver and kidney. A second pathway of T 4 to T 3 conversion occurs via a PTU-insensitive 5\u2019-deiodinase located primarily in the pituitary and central nervous system. The prohormone T 4 must be converted to T 3 in the body before it can exert biological effects. During periods of illness or stress, this conversion is often inhibited and can be diverted to the inactive reverse T 3 (rT 3 ) moiety. Therefore, correction of the hypothyroid condition in patients with myxedema coma is facilitated by the parenteral administration of triiodothyronine (T 3 ). T 3 is bound much less firmly to serum binding proteins and therefore penetrates into the cells much more rapidly than T 4 . Also, the binding of T 3 to a nuclear thyroid hormone receptor seems to initiate most effects of thyroid hormone in tissues. Although most thyroid hormone analogs, both natural and synthetic, will bind to this protein, the affinity of T 3 for this receptor is roughly 10-fold higher than that of T 4 . Thus, T 3 is the biologically active thyroid hormone. Pharmacodynamics The clinical features of myxedema coma include depression of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, impaired diuresis, and hypothermia. Administration of thyroid hormones reverses or attenuates these conditions. Thyroid hormones increase heart rate, ventricular contractility and cardiac output, as well as decrease total systemic vascular resistance. They also increase the rate and depth of respiration, motility of the gastrointestinal tract, rapidity of cerebration, and vasodilatation. Thyroid hormones correct hypothermia by markedly increasing the basal metabolic rate, as well as the number and activity of mitochondria in almost all cells of the body. Pharmacokinetics Since liothyronine sodium (T 3 ) is not firmly bound to serum protein, it is readily available to body tissues. Liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff of activity which permits quick dosage adjustment and facilitates control of the effects of overdosage, should they occur. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T 4 ) as compared to triiodothyronine (T 3 ) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. T 4 is deiodinated to T 3 . A single dose of liothyronine sodium administered intravenously produces a detectable metabolic response in as little as two to four hours and a maximum therapeutic response within two days. However, no pharmacokinetic studies have been performed with intravenous liothyronine (T 3 ) in myxedema coma or precoma patients."

Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The use of thyroid hormones in the therapy of obesity, alone or combined with other drugs, is unjustified and has been shown to be ineffective. Neither is their use justified for the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is accompanied by hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspect. These include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is a greater likelihood of occult cardiac disease. Therefore, in patients with compromised cardiac function, use thyroid hormones in conjunction with careful cardiac monitoring. Although the specific dosage of liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) depends upon individual circumstances, in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease the extremely rapid onset of action of liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) may warrant initiating therapy at a dose of 10 mcg to 20 mcg. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Myxedematous patients are very sensitive to thyroid hormones; dosage should be started at a low level and increased gradually as acute changes may precipitate adverse cardiovascular events. Severe and prolonged hypothyroidism can lead to a decreased level of adrenocortical activity commensurate with the lowered metabolic state. When thyroid replacement therapy is administered, the metabolism increases at a greater rate than adrenocortical activity. This can precipitate adrenocortical insufficiency. Therefore, in severe and prolonged hypothyroidism, supplemental adrenocortical steroids may be necessary. In rare instances, the administration of thyroid hormone may precipitate a hyperthyroid state or may aggravate existing hyperthyroidism. Extreme caution is advised when administering thyroid hormones with digitalis or vasopressors. (See PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions .) Fluid therapy should be administered with great care to prevent cardiac decompensation. (See PRECAUTIONS-Adjunctive Therapy .)"
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions, Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics regarding interaction and dose adjustment with insulin) or insipidus or adrenal cortical insufficiency may aggravate the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endocrine diseases are required. The therapy of myxedema coma requires simultaneous administration of glucocorticoids. (See PRECAUTIONS-Adjunctive Therapy ). Hypothyroidism decreases and hyperthyroidism increases the sensitivity to anticoagulants. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored in thyroid-treated patients on anticoagulants and dosage of the latter agents adjusted on the basis of frequent prothrombin time determinations. Oral therapy should be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication. If L-thyroxine rather than liothyronine sodium is used in initiating oral therapy, the physician should bear in mind that there is a delay of several days in the onset of L-thyroxine activity and that intravenous therapy should be discontinued gradually. Adjunctive Therapy Many investigators recommend that corticosteroids be administered routinely in the initial emergency treatment of all patients with myxedema coma. Patients with pituitary myxedema should receive adrenocortical hormone replacement therapy at or before the start of liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) therapy. Similarly, patients with primary myxedema may also require adrenocortical hormone replacement therapy since a rapid return to normal body metabolism from a severely hypothyroid state may result in acute adrenocortical insufficiency and shock. In considering the need to elevate blood pressure, it should be kept in mind that tissue metabolic requirements are markedly reduced in the hypothyroid patient. Because arrhythmias and circulatory collapse have infrequently occurred following the concomitant administration of thyroid hormones and vasopressor therapies, use caution when administering these therapies concomitantly. (See PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions, Vasopressors .) Hyponatremia is frequently present in myxedema coma, but usually resolves without specific therapy as the metabolic status of the patient is improved with thyroid hormone treatment. Fluid therapy should be administered with great care to prevent cardiac decompensation. In addition, some patients with myxedema have inappropriate secretion of ADH and are susceptible to water intoxication. In some patients, respiratory depression has been a significant factor in the development or persistence of the comatose state. Decreased oxygen saturation and elevated CO 2 levels respond quickly to artificial respiration. Infection is often present in myxedema coma and should be looked for and treated appropriately. Concomitant use of liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) and artificial rewarming of patients is contraindicated. Although patients in myxedema coma are often hypothermic, most investigators believe that artificial rewarming is of little value or may be harmful. The peripheral vasodilation produced by external heat serves to further decrease circulation to vital internal organs and to increase shock if present. It has been reported that the administration of liothyronine sodium will restore a normal body temperature in 24 to 48 hours if heat loss is prevented by keeping the patient covered with blankets in a warm room. Laboratory Tests Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. Serum T 3 and TSH levels should be monitored to assess dosage adequacy and biologic effectiveness. Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants: Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy. Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics: Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy. Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives: Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient\u2019s thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free thyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given. Tricyclic Antidepressants: Use of thyroid products with imipramine and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity; transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed. Thyroid hormone activity may also be enhanced. Digitalis: Thyroid preparations may potentiate the toxic effects of digitalis. Thyroid hormonal replacement increases metabolic rate, which requires an increase in digitalis dosage. Ketamine: When administered to patients on a thyroid preparation, this parenteral anesthetic may cause hypertension and tachycardia. Use with caution and be prepared to treat hypertension, if necessary. Vasopressors: Thyroid hormones increase the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Therefore, use of vasopressors in patients receiving thyroid hormone preparations may increase the risk of precipitating coronary insufficiency, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, use caution when administering vasopressors with liothyronine (T 3 ). DRUG/LABORATORY TEST INTERACTIONS The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on thyroid hormone therapy: androgens, corticosteroids, estrogens, oral contraceptives containing estrogens, iodine-containing preparations and the numerous preparations containing salicylates. Changes in TBG concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of T 4 and T 3 values. In such cases, the unbound (free) hormone should be measured. Pregnancy, estrogens and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase TBG concentrations. TBG may also be increased during infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBG concentrations are observed in nephrosis, acromegaly and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper- or hypothyroxine-binding globulinemias have been described. The incidence of TBG deficiency approximates 1 in 9000. The binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) is inhibited by salicylates. Medicinal or dietary iodine interferes with all in vivo tests of radioiodine uptake, producing low uptakes which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A reportedly apparent association between prolonged thyroid therapy and breast cancer has not been confirmed and patients on thyroid for established indications should not discontinue therapy. No confirmatory long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility in either males or females. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category A: Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier. The clinical experience to date does not indicate any adverse effect on fetuses when thyroid hormones are administered to pregnant women. On the basis of current knowledge, thyroid replacement therapy to hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers Minimal amounts of thyroid hormones are excreted in human milk. Thyroid hormones are not associated with serious adverse reactions and do not have a known tumorigenic potential. However, caution should be exercised when thyroid hormones are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of liothyronine sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Pediatric Use There is limited experience with liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) in the pediatric population. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances, possible infection, or other intercurrent illness in addition to the administration of intravenous liothyronine (T 3 ). Simultaneous glucocorticosteroids are required. Liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) is for intravenous administration only. It should not be given intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Prompt administration of an adequate dose of intravenous liothyronine (T 3 ) is important in determining clinical outcome. Initial and subsequent doses of liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) should be based on continuous monitoring of the patient\u2019s clinical status and response to therapy. Liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) should normally be administered at least four hours-and not more than 12 hours-apart. Administration of at least 65 mcg/day of intravenous liothyronine (T 3 ) in the initial days of therapy was associated with lower mortality. There is limited clinical experience with intravenous liothyronine (T 3 ) at total daily doses exceeding 100 mcg/day. No controlled clinical studies have been done with liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ). The following dosing guidelines have been derived from data analysis of myxedema coma/precoma case reports collected by SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals since 1963 and from scientific literature since 1956. An initial intravenous liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) dose ranging from 25 mcg to 50 mcg is recommended in the emergency treatment of myxedema coma/precoma in adults. In patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease, an initial dose of 10 mcg to 20 mcg is suggested (see WARNINGS ). However, both the initial dose and subsequent doses should be determined on the basis of continuous monitoring of the patient\u2019s clinical condition and response to liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) therapy. Normally at least four hours should be allowed between doses to adequately assess therapeutic response and no more than 12 hours should elapse between doses to avoid fluctuations in hormone levels. Caution should be exercised in adjusting the dose due to the potential of large changes to precipitate adverse cardiovascular events. Review of the myxedema case reports indicates decreased mortality in patients receiving at least 65 mcg/day in the initial days of treatment. However, there is limited clinical experience at total daily doses above 100 mcg. See PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions for potential interactions between thyroid hormones and digitalis and vasopressors. Pediatric Use There is limited experience with liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ) in the pediatric population. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Switching to Oral Therapy Oral therapy should be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets from liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ), discontinue liothyronine sodium injection (T 3 ), initiate oral therapy at a low dosage, and increase gradually according to the patient\u2019s response. If L-thyroxine rather then liothyronine sodium is used in initiating oral therapy, the physician should bear in mind that there is a delay of several days in the onset of L-thyroxine activity and that intravenous therapy should be discontinued gradually."

Liothyronine sodium tablets are not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium tablets dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium tablets should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets Liothyronine sodium tablets has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium tablets, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium tablets dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium tablets may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium tablets treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium tablets therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium tablets and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium tablets dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium tablets [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium tablets has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium tablets may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium tablets carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium tablets and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium tablets that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets ( 7 ) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium tablets (see Tables 1 \u2013 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium tablets by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium tablets at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium tablets therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium tablets are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium tablets increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium tablets dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium tablets may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium tablets may result in increased liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium tablets may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium tablets may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium tablets should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium tablets requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium tablets dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium tablets varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6) ] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium tablets at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider should they become pregnant or breastfeeding or are thinking of becoming pregnant, while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. Important Information Inform patients that the liothyronine in liothyronine sodium tablets are intended to replace a hormone that is normally produced by the thyroid gland. Generally replacement therapy is to be taken for life. Inform patients that liothyronine sodium tablets should not be used as a primary or adjunctive therapy in a weight control program. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are taking any other medications, including prescription and over-the-counter preparations. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider of any other medical conditions, particularly heart disease, diabetes, clotting disorders, and adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as the dose of medications used to control these other conditions may need to be adjusted while taking liothyronine sodium tablets. If patents are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners), their clotting status should be checked frequently. Instruct patients to notify their physician or dentist if they are taking liothyronine sodium tablets prior to any surgery. Adverse Reactions Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they experience any of the following symptoms: rapid or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg cramps, headache, nervousness, irritability, sleeplessness, tremors, change in appetite, weight gain or loss, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, fever, changes in menstrual periods, hives or skin rash, or any other unusual medical event [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] .

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily and individual dosage according to patient response and laboratory findings ( 2.1 ) See full prescribing information for recommended dosage for hypothyroidism ( 2.2 ) TSH suppression in well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( 2.3 ) and for thyroid suppression test ( 2.4 ) When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of liothyronine sodium for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Administer liothyronine sodium tablets orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with liothyronine sodium tablets 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of liothyronine sodium should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of liothyronine sodium tablets. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to liothyronine sodium, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of liothyronine sodium may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of liothyronine sodium [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant liothyronine sodium and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with liothyronine sodium [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of liothyronine sodium carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using liothyronine sodium and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing liothyronine sodium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of liothyronine sodium that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with liothyronine sodium therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Overdosage (10)] . They include the following: General : fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system : headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal : tremors, muscle weakness and cramps Cardiovascular : palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory : dyspnea Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic : hair loss, flushing Endocrine : decreased bone mineral density Reproductive : menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in pediatric patients receiving thyroid replacement therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in pediatric patients with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness and wheezing. Most common adverse reactions for liothyronine sodium are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC @1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7) 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 to 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine sodium should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of liothyronine sodium varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )] . In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Adverse Reactions (6)] . Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate liothyronine sodium at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

Gradually increase the dose according to the patient's response ( 2.5 ) Adequacy of therapy determined with periodic monitoring of TSH and T3 levels as well as clinical status ( 2.6 ) 2.1 General Principles of Dosing The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP for hypothyroidism or pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5) , and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP orally once daily. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Hypothyroidism Adults The recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg orally once daily. Increase the dose by 25 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks, if needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25 mcg to 75 mcg once daily. For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP 5 mcg once daily and increase by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of liothyronine sodium dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum T3 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Pediatric Patients The recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg once daily, with a 5 mcg increase every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require 20 mcg once daily for maintenance. At 1 year of age, 50 mcg once daily may be required. Above 3 years of age, the full adult dosage may be necessary [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure: Consider a lower starting dose in infants at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose as needed based on clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity: To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached. Pregnancy Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce thyroid hormone dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure thyroid hormone dose is appropriate. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require higher doses, depending on the target level for TSH suppression. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Thyroid Suppression Test The recommended dose is 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily for 7 days, with radioactive iodine uptake being determined before and after the 7 day administration of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP. If thyroid function is normal, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis. 2.5 Switching from Levothyroxine to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP Liothyronine sodium has a rapid onset of action and residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks after initiating liothyronine sodium therapy. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, discontinue levothyroxine therapy and initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at a low dosage. Gradually increase the liothyronine sodium dose according to the patient's response. 2.6 Monitoring TSH and Triiodothyronine (T3) Levels Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors. Adults In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH periodically after initiation of the therapy or any change in dose. To check the immediate response to therapy before the TSH has had a chance to respond or if your patient's status needs to be assessed prior to that point, measurement of total T3 would be most appropriate. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status. Pediatrics In pediatric patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring serum TSH and T3 levels. For pediatric patients three years of age and older, the recommended monitoring is every 3 to 12 months thereafter, following dose stabilization until growth and puberty are completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals. While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter after initiation of liothyronine sodium therapy may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] . Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism Monitor serum T3 levels and maintain in the normal range."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. ( 5.2 ) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of liothyronine sodium treatment ( 5.3 ) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy ( 5.5 ) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over-replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Overtreatment with thyroid hormone may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate liothyronine sodium therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive liothyronine sodium therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiovascular symptoms develop or worsen, reduce or withhold the liothyronine sodium dose for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of thyroid hormone from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids. Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism Liothyronine sodium has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with liothyronine sodium may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and on glucose and lipid metabolism. Titrate the dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of thyroid hormone therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 5.6 Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of thyroid hormone over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate against this risk."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium 7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4). Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. Drug or Drug Class Effect Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) Drug or Drug Class Effect Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration. Salicylates (>2 g/day) Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. Drug or Drug Class Effect Phenobarbital Rifampin Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. Drug or Drug Class Effect Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day) In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone \u22654 mg/day) Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above). Other drugs: Amiodarone Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.3 Oral Anticoagulants Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 7.4 Digitalis Glycosides Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 7.5 Antidepressant Therapy Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements. 7.6 Ketamine Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 7.7 Sympathomimetics Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentrations. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy may require the use of higher doses of thyroid hormone ( 2.2 , 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Experience with liothyronine use in pregnant women, including data from post-marketing studies, have not reported increased rates of major birth defects or miscarriages (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy. Since TSH levels may increase during pregnancy, TSH should be monitored and liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no animal studies conducted with liothyronine during pregnancy. Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP should not be discontinued during pregnancy and hypothyroidism diagnosed during pregnancy should be promptly treated. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that liothyronine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of liothyronine on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of liothyronine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for liothyronine sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from liothyronine sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with thyroid hormone overtreatment in the elderly."

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy is associated with a higher rate of complications, including spontaneous abortion, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism may have an adverse effect on fetal neurocognitive development. Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period Pregnancy may increase liothyronine sodium requirements. Serum TSH levels should be monitored and the liothyronine sodium dosage adjusted during pregnancy. Since postpartum TSH levels are similar to preconception values, the liothyronine sodium dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose immediately after delivery [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Data Human Data Liothyronine is approved for use as a replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. Data from post-marketing studies have not reported increased rates of fetal malformations, miscarriages, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes associated with liothyronine use in pregnant women."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The initial dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4 )]. In pediatric patients in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue thyroid hormone for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum TSH, T4, and T3 levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessments to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Congenital Hypothyroidism [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.6 )] Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate thyroid hormone immediately upon diagnosis. Thyroid hormone is generally continued for life in these patients. Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of thyroid hormone therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling. Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature. Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium occurs within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Distribution Liothyronine sodium (T3) is not firmly bound to serum protein. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T4) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T3) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity. Elimination Metabolism The major pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is through sequential deiodination. Approximately 80% of circulating T3 is derived from peripheral T4 by monodeiodination. The liver is the major site of degradation for both T4 and T3. T3 is further deiodinated to diiodothyronine. Thyroid hormones are also metabolized via conjugation with glucuronides and sulfates and excreted directly into the bile and gut where they undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Excretion Thyroid hormones are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. A portion of the conjugated hormone reaches the colon unchanged and is eliminated in the feces. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing tetraiodothyronine (T 4 , levothyroxine) sodium or triiodothyronine (T 3 , liothyronine) sodium or both. T 4 and T 3 are produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. T 4 contains four iodine atoms and is formed by the coupling of two molecules of diiodotyrosine (DIT). T 3 contains three atoms of iodine and is formed by the coupling of one molecule of DIT with one molecule of monoiodotyrosine (MIT). Both hormones are stored in the thyroid colloid as thyroglobulin. Thyroid hormone preparations belong to two categories: (1) natural hormonal preparations derived from animal thyroid, and (2) synthetic preparations. Natural preparations include desiccated thyroid and thyroglobulin. Desiccated thyroid is derived from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (either beef or hog thyroid), and thyroglobulin is derived from thyroid glands of the hog. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has standardized the total iodine content of natural preparations. Thyroid USP contains not less than (NLT) 0.17 percent and not more than (NMT) 0.23 percent iodine, and thyroglobulin contains not less than (NLT) 0.7 percent of organically bound iodine. Iodine content is only an indirect indicator of true hormonal biologic activity. Liothyronine sodium tablets contain liothyronine (L-triiodothyronine or LT 3 ), a synthetic form of a natural thyroid hormone, and is available as the sodium salt. The structural and empirical formulas and molecular weight of liothyronine sodium are given below. Liothyronine Sodium L-Tyrosine, O-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenyl)-3,5-diiodo-,monosodium salt Twenty-five mcg liothyronine is equivalent to approximately 1 grain of desiccated thyroid or thyroglobulin and 0.1 mg of L-thyroxine. Inactive ingredients consist of calcium sulfate dihydrate, corn starch, gelatin, magnesium stearate and mannitol. image description"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic action are not well understood. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body, increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system. Pharmacokinetics Since liothyronine sodium (T 3 ) is not firmly bound to serum protein, it is readily available to body tissues. The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium is rapid, occurring within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days, providing early clinical response. The biological half-life is about 2-1/2 days. T 3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones. Liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff of activity which permits quick dosage adjustment and facilitates control of the effects of overdosage, should they occur. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T 4 ) for both thyroid-binding globulin and thyroid-binding prealbumin as compared to triiodothyronine (T 3 ) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity."

As replacement or supplemental therapy in patients with hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. This category includes cretinism, myxedema and ordinary hypothyroidism in patients of any age (pediatric patients, adults, the elderly), or state (including pregnancy); primary hypothyroidism resulting from functional deficiency, primary atrophy, partial or total absence of thyroid gland, or the effects of surgery, radiation, or drugs, with or without the presence of goiter; and secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism (see WARNINGS ). 2. As pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppressants, in the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters, including thyroid nodules, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto\u2019s) and multinodular goiter. 3. As diagnostic agents in suppression tests to differentiate suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy. Liothyronine sodium tablets can be used in patients allergic to desiccated thyroid or thyroid extract derived from pork or beef."

There is no well-documented evidence from the literature, however, of true allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to thyroid hormone."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects. The use of thyroid hormones in the therapy of obesity, alone or combined with other drugs, is unjustified and has been shown to be ineffective. Neither is their use justified for the treatment of male or female infertility unless this condition is accompanied by hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspected. These include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is a greater likelihood of occult cardiac disease. In these patients, liothyronine sodium therapy should be initiated with low doses, with due consideration for its relatively rapid onset of action. Starting dosage of liothyronine sodium tablets is 5 mcg daily, and should be increased by no more than 5 mcg increments at 2-week intervals. When, in such patients, a euthyroid state can only be reached at the expense of an aggravation of the cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone dosage should be reduced. Morphologic hypogonadism and nephrosis should be ruled out before the drug is administered. If hypopituitarism is present, the adrenal deficiency must be corrected prior to starting the drug. Myxedematous patients are very sensitive to thyroid; dosage should be started at a very low level and increased gradually. Severe and prolonged hypothyroidism can lead to a decreased level of adrenocortical activity commensurate with the lowered metabolic state. When thyroid-replacement therapy is administered, the metabolism increases at a greater rate than adrenocortical activity. This can precipitate adrenocortical insufficiency. Therefore, in severe and prolonged hypothyroidism, supplemental adrenocortical steroids may be necessary. In rare instances the administration of thyroid hormone may precipitate a hyperthyroid state or may aggravate existing hyperthyroidism."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General - Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or insipidus or adrenal cortical insufficiency aggravates the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endocrine diseases are required. The therapy of myxedema coma requires simultaneous administration of glucocorticoids. Hypothyroidism decreases and hyperthyroidism increases the sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin time should be closely monitored in thyroid-treated patients on oral anticoagulants and dosage of the latter agents adjusted on the basis of frequent prothrombin time determinations. In infants, excessive doses of thyroid hormone preparations may produce craniosynostosis. Information for the Patient - Patients on thyroid hormone preparations and parents of pediatric patients on thyroid therapy should be informed that: 1. Replacement therapy is to be taken essentially for life, with the exception of cases of transient hypothyroidism, usually associated with thyroiditis, and in those patients receiving a therapeutic trial of the drug. 2. They should immediately report during the course of therapy any signs or symptoms of thyroid hormone toxicity, e.g., chest pain, increased pulse rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, nervousness, or any other unusual event. 3. In case of concomitant diabetes mellitus, the daily dosage of antidiabetic medication may need readjustment as thyroid hormone replacement is achieved. If thyroid medication is stopped, a downward readjustment of the dosage of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia. At all times, close monitoring of urinary glucose levels is mandatory in such patients. 4. In case of concomitant oral anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time should be measured frequently to determine if the dosage of oral anticoagulants is to be readjusted. 5. Partial loss of hair may be experienced by pediatric patients in the first few months of thyroid therapy, but this is usually a transient phenomenon and later recovery is usually the rule. Laboratory Tests - Treatment of patients with thyroid hormones requires the periodic assessment of thyroid status by means of appropriate laboratory tests besides the full clinical evaluation. The TSH suppression test can be used to test the effectiveness of any thyroid preparation, bearing in mind the relative insensitivity of the infant pituitary to the negative feedback effect of thyroid hormones. Serum T 4 levels can be used to test the effectiveness of all thyroid medications except products containing liothyronine sodium. When the total serum T 4 is low but TSH is normal, a test specific to assess unbound (free) T 4 levels is warranted. Specific measurements of T 4 and T 3 by competitive protein binding or radioimmunoassay are not influenced by blood levels of organic or inorganic iodine and have essentially replaced older tests of thyroid hormone measurements, i.e., PBI, BEI and T 4 by column. Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants - Thyroid hormones appear to increase catabolism of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. If oral anticoagulants are also being given, compensatory increases in clotting factor synthesis are impaired. Patients stabilized on oral anticoagulants who are found to require thyroid replacement therapy should be watched very closely when thyroid is started. If a patient is truly hypothyroid, it is likely that a reduction in anticoagulant dosage will be required. No special precautions appear to be necessary when oral anticoagulant therapy is begun in a patient already stabilized on maintenance thyroid replacement therapy. Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics - Initiating thyroid replacement therapy may cause increases in insulin or oral hypoglycemic requirements. The effects seen are poorly understood and depend upon a variety of factors such as dose and type of thyroid preparations and endocrine status of the patient. Patients receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemics should be closely watched during initiation of thyroid replacement therapy. Cholestyramine - Cholestyramine binds both T 4 and T 3 in the intestine, thus impairing absorption of these thyroid hormones. In vitro studies indicate that the binding is not easily removed. Therefore, 4 to 5 hours should elapse between administration of cholestyramine and thyroid hormones. Estrogen, Oral Contraceptives - Estrogens tend to increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBg). In a patient with a nonfunctioning thyroid gland who is receiving thyroid replacement therapy, free levothyroxine may be decreased when estrogens are started thus increasing thyroid requirements. However, if the patient\u2019s thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free thyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in thyroxine output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given. Tricyclic Antidepressants - Use of thyroid products with imipramine and other tricyclic antidepressants may increase receptor sensitivity and enhance antidepressant activity; transient cardiac arrhythmias have been observed. Thyroid hormone activity may also be enhanced. Digitalis - Thyroid preparations may potentiate the toxic effects of digitalis. Thyroid hormonal replacement increases metabolic rate, which requires an increase in digitalis dosage. Ketamine - When administered to patients on a thyroid preparation, this parenteral anesthetic may cause hypertension and tachycardia. Use with caution and be prepared to treat hypertension, if necessary. Vasopressors - Thyroxine increases the adrenergic effect of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. Therefore, injection of these agents into patients receiving thyroid preparations increases the risk of precipitating coronary insufficiency, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. Careful observation is required. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions - The following drugs or moieties are known to interfere with laboratory tests performed in patients on thyroid hormone therapy: androgens, corticosteroids, estrogens, oral contraceptives containing estrogens, iodine-containing preparations and the numerous preparations containing salicylates. 1. Changes in TBg concentration should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of T 4 and T 3 values. In such cases, the unbound (free) hormone should be measured. Pregnancy, estrogens and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives increase TBg concentrations. TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis, acromegaly and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper- or hypothyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described. The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9000. The binding of thyroxine by thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) is inhibited by salicylates. 2. Medicinal or dietary iodine interferes with all in vivo tests of radioiodine uptake, producing low uptakes which may not be reflective of a true decrease in hormone synthesis. 3. The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance, poor absorption, excessive fecal loss, or inactivity of the preparation. Intracellular resistance to thyroid hormone is quite rare. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility - A reportedly apparent association between prolonged thyroid therapy and breast cancer has not been confirmed and patients on thyroid for established indications should not discontinue therapy. No confirmatory long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility in either males or females. Pregnancy - Category A. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier. The clinical experience to date does not indicate any adverse effect on fetuses when thyroid hormones are administered to pregnant women. On the basis of current knowledge, thyroid replacement therapy to hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers - Minimal amounts of thyroid hormones are excreted in human milk. Thyroid is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential. However, caution should be exercised when thyroid is administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use - Clinical studies of liothyronine sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Pediatric Use - Pregnant mothers provide little or no thyroid hormone to the fetus. The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism is relatively high (1:4000) and the hypothyroid fetus would not derive any benefit from the small amounts of hormone crossing the placental barrier. Routine determinations of serum T 4 and/or TSH is strongly advised in neonates in view of the deleterious effects of thyroid deficiency on growth and development. Treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis and maintained for life, unless transient hypothyroidism is suspected, in which case, therapy may be interrupted for 2 to 8 weeks after the age of 3 years to reassess the condition. Cessation of therapy is justified in patients who have maintained a normal TSH during those 2 to 8 weeks."

      "OVERDOSAGE Signs and Symptoms - Headache, irritability, nervousness, sweating, arrhythmia (including tachycardia), increased bowel motility and menstrual irregularities. Angina pectoris or congestive heart failure may be induced or aggravated. Shock may also develop. Massive overdosage may result in symptoms resembling thyroid storm. Chronic excessive dosage will produce the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment Of Overdosage - Dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function is restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression. Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if further gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented and barring contraindications such as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxygen may be administered and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glycosides may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 mg over a 10-minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day, especially when no contraindications exist for its use."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings. Liothyronine sodium tablets are intended for oral administration; once-a-day dosage is recommended. Although liothyronine sodium has a rapid cutoff, its metabolic effects persist for a few days following discontinuance. Mild Hypothyroidism: Recommended starting dosage is 25 mcg daily. Daily dosage then may be increased by up to 25 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks. Usual maintenance dose is 25 to 75 mcg daily. The rapid onset and dissipation of action of liothyronine sodium (T 3 ), as compared with levothyroxine sodium (T 4 ), has led some clinicians to prefer its use in patients who might be more susceptible to the untoward effects of thyroid medication. However, the wide swings in serum T 3 levels that follow its administration and the possibility of more pronounced cardiovascular side effects tend to counterbalance the stated advantages. Liothyronine sodium tablets may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T 4 ) during radioisotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 is suspected. Myxedema: Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily. This may be increased by 5 to 10 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks. When 25 mcg daily is reached, dosage may be increased by 5 to 25 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks until a satisfactory therapeutic response is attained. Usual maintenance dose is 50 to 100 mcg daily. Myxedema Coma: Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. An intravenous preparation of liothyronine sodium is marketed by JONES PHARMA INCORPORATED, under the trade name Triostat\u00ae for use in myxedema coma/precoma. Congenital Hypothyroidism: Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily, with a 5 mcg increment every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Infants a few months old may require only 20 mcg daily for maintenance. At 1 year, 50 mcg daily may be required. Above 3 years, full adult dosage may be necessary (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). Simple (non-toxic) Goiter: Recommended starting dosage is 5 mcg daily. This dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mcg daily every 1 or 2 weeks. When 25 mcg daily is reached, dosage may be increased every week or two by 12.5 or 25 mcg. Usual maintenance dosage is 75 mcg daily. In the elderly or in pediatric patients, therapy should be started with 5 mcg daily and increased only by 5 mcg increments at the recommended intervals. When switching a patient to Liothyronine Sodium tablets from thyroid, L-thyroxine or thyroglobulin, discontinue the other medication, initiate liothyronine sodium at a low dosage, and increase gradually according to the patient's response. When selecting a starting dosage, bear in mind that this drug has a rapid onset of action, and that residual effects of the other thyroid preparation may persist for the first several weeks of therapy. Thyroid Suppression Therapy: Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom baseline laboratory tests appear normal or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy. 131 I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy. Each 5 mcg tablet contains liothyronine sodium equivalent to 5 mcg of liothyronine. Each 25 mcg tablet contains liothyronine sodium equivalent to 25 mcg of liothyronine. Each 50 mcg tablet contains liothyronine sodium equivalent to 50 mcg of liothyronine. Liothyronine sodium tablets are given in doses of 75 to 100 mcg/day for 7 days, and radioactive iodine uptake is determined before and after administration of the hormone. If thyroid function is under normal control, the radioiodine uptake will drop significantly after treatment. Liothyronine sodium tablets should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is a strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source."
