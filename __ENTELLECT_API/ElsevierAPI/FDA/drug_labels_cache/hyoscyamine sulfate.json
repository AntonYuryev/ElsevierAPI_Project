      "WARNINGS Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate and Scopolamine Hydrobromide Tablets may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs. Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction."

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for oral administration. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219H 2 SO 4 \u22192H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)- endo ]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, stearic acid, and FD&C blue #1. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3\u00bd hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \"drying agent\" in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets USP contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for oral administration. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: Colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets USP before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets USP are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "WARNINGS Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with belladonna alkaloids (fever and heatstroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. The patient should be warned, should these occur, not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery, and not to perform hazardous work. Phenobarbital may decrease the effect of anticoagulants, and necessitate larger doses of the anticoagulant for optimal effect. When the phenobarbital is discontinued, the dose of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased. Phenobarbital may be habit forming and should not be administered to individuals known to be addiction prone or to those with a history of physical and/or psychological dependence upon drugs. Since barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, they should be used with caution and initial doses should be small in patients with hepatic dysfunction."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy hepatic or renal disease hyperthyroidism coronary heart disease congestive heart failure cardiac arrhythmias tachycardia hypertension Belladonna alkaloids may produce a delay in gastric emptying (antral stasis) which would complicate the management of gastric ulcer. Do not rely on the use of the drug in the presence of complication of biliary tract disease. Theoretically, with overdosage, a curare-like action may occur. Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir \u2013 Mint contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. Information for Patients Phenobarbital, Hyoscyamine Sulfate, Atropine Sulfate, Scopolamine Hydrobromide Elixir may produce drowsiness or blurred vision.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets contain 0.375 mg of hyoscyamine sulfate in a formulation designed for oral b.i.d. dosage. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022 H 2 SO 4 \u2022 2H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, (\u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-,8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1.] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-,sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets also contain as inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, Hydroxypropyl cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate. image description"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine Sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3\u00bd hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. Hyoscyamine sulfate extended-release tablets release 0.375 mg hyoscyamine sulfate at a controlled and predictable rate for 12 hours. The mean peak plasma concentration occurred at 4.20 hours. The mean (\u00b1SEM) apparent plasma elimination half-life is 7.47 hours (\u00b10.60). Tablets may not completely disintegrate and may be excreted by some patients."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine sulfate is effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. It can also be used to control gastric secretion, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm, and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis, and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine sulfate is indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrythmias, hypertension, and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drug since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Tablets may not completely disintegrate and may be excreted by some patients. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy - Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use: Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets release 0.375 mg hyoscyamine sulfate at a controlled and predictable rate for 12 hours. Tablets may not completely disintegrate and may be excreted by some patients."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Tablets may not completely disintegrate and may be excreted by some patients. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for sublingual administration. However, the tablets may be chewed or taken orally. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and flavor. Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. The tablets can be taken orally with the same pharmacological effects occurring; however, the effects may not occur as rapidly as with sublingual administration."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine Sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node, and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration as well as oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. The tablets can be taken orally with the same pharmacological effects occurring; however, the effects may not occur as rapidly as with sublingual administration."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine sulfate is effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. It can also be used to control gastric secretion, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm, and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis, and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Also used in the treatment of infant colic (elixir and drops). Hyoscyamine sulfate is indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, Hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrythmias, hypertension, and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drug since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy - Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use: Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been reported with hyoscyamine sulfate and for pharmacologically similar drugs with anticholinergic/antispasmodic action. Adverse reactions may include dryness of the mouth; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitations; mydriasis; increased ocular tension; loss of taste; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; fatigue; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; constipation; bloated feeling; abdominal pain; diarrhea; allergic reactions or drug idiosyncrasies; urticaria and other dermal manifestations; ataxia; speech disturbance; some degree of mental confusion and/or excitement (especially in elderly persons); short-term memory loss; hallucinations; and decreased sweating."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of overdose are headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dilated pupils, hot dry skin, dizziness, dryness of the mouth, difficulty in swallowing, and CNS stimulation. Measures to be taken are immediate lavage of the stomach and injection of physostigmine 0.5 to 2 mg intravenously and repeated as necessary up to a total of 5 mg. Fever may be treated symptomatically (tepid water sponge baths, hypothermic blanket). Excitement to a degree which demands attention may be managed with sodium thiopental 2% solution given slowly intravenously or chloral hydrate (100-200 mL of a 2% solution) by rectal infusion. In the event of progression of the curare-like effect to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, artificial respiration should be instituted and maintained until effective respiratory action returns. In rats, the LD 50 for hyoscyamine is 375 mg/kg. Hyoscyamine sulfate is dialyzable."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine, but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \"drying agent\" in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets before meals, antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for sublingual administration. However, the tablets may be chewed or taken orally. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, stearic acid, and FD&C blue #1."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration as well as oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3\u00bd hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. The tablets can be taken orally with the same pharmacological effects occurring; however, the effects may not occur as rapidly as with sublingual administration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy-Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use: Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP is effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. In acute episodes, Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP can be used to control gastric secretion, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm, and associated abdominal cramps. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Parenterally administered Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP is also effective in reducing gastrointestinal motility to facilitate diagnostic procedures such as endoscopy or hypotonic duodenography. Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP may be used to reduce pain and hypersecretion in pancreatitis, in certain cases of partial heart block associated with vagal activity, and as an antidote for poisoning by anticholinesterase agents. In Anesthesia: Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP is indicated as a pre-operative antimuscarinic to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions, to reduce the volume and acidity of gastric secretions, and to block cardiac vagal inhibitory reflexes during induction of anesthesia and intubation. Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP protects against the peripheral muscarinic effects such as bradycardia and excessive secretions produced by halogenated hydrocarbons and cholinergic agents such as physostigmine, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine given to reverse the actions of curariform agents. In Urology: Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP may also be used intravenously to improve radiologic visibility of the kidneys. It is also indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP may produce drowsiness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms, and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drug since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Use of Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP is administered concomitantly with other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, amantadine, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, opiod (narcotic) analgesics, phenothiazines, potassium chloride, tricyclic antidepressants and some antihistamines. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP. Pregnancy - Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP. It is also not known whether Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine sulfate Injection, USP is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions in the brain, including memory functions."

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Oral Tablets, USP contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for oral administration. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219H 2 SO 4 \u22192H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Crospovidone, Magnesium Stearate, Mannitol, and Flavor. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine, but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Oral Tablets, USP are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Oral Tablets, USP are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \"drying agent\" in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Oral Tablets, USP before meals, antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Oral Tablets, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Oral Tablets, USP are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

    "pediatric_use": [
      "Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics."
    ],
    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets, 0.125 mg disintegrate within seconds after placement on the tongue, allowing them to be swallowed with or without water. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3\u00bd hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \"drying agent\" in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for oral administration. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: Colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

Patients taking this product should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous tasks while taking this drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: The formulation for Hyoscyamine Sulfate ER is a non-eroding, non-gelling sustained release matrix. The drug releases from the tablet while the tablet remains intact. Therefore, it is possible that a tablet may appear in your stool. This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. Tablets should be swallowed whole. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for oral administration. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, stearic acid, and FD&C blue #1."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Tablets, USP are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy-Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use: Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for sublingual administration. However, the tablets may be chewed or taken orally. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219H 2 SO 4 \u22192H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Crospovidone, Magnesium Stearate, Mannitol, and Flavor. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration as well as oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine, but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. The tablets can be taken orally with the same pharmacological effects occurring; however, the effects may not occur as rapidly as with sublingual administration."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \"drying agent\" in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Oral Tablets contain 0.375 mg hyoscyamine sulfate in a formulation designed for oral b.i.d. dosage. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2219H 2 SO 4 \u22192H2O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Hydroxypropyl Cellulose, Magnesium Stearate and Microcrystalline Cellulose. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine, but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Oral Tablets release 0.375 mg hyoscyamine sulfate at a controlled and predictable rate for 12 hours. Tablets may not completely disintegrate and may be excreted by some patients."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Oral Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Oral Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \"drying agent\" in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy (for example, bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy); obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (as in achalasia, pyloroduodenal stenosis); paralytic ileus, intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Tablets may not completely disintegrate and may be excreted by some patients. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Oral Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Extended-Release Oral Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for sublingual administration. However, the tablets may be chewed or taken orally. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, stearic acid, and FD&C blue #1."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration as well as oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3\u00bd hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. The tablets can be taken orally with the same pharmacological effects occurring; however, the effects may not occur as rapidly as with sublingual administration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis. May be used in the therapy of poisoning by anticholinesterase agents."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy-Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when hyoscyamine sulfate are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use: Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for oral administration. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets, 0.125 mg disintegrate within seconds after placement on the tongue, allowing them to be swallowed with or without water. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids. The empirical formula is (C 17 H 23 NO 3 ) 2 \u2022H 2 SO 4 \u20222H 2 O and the molecular weight is 712.85. Chemically, it is benzeneacetic acid, \u03b1-(hydroxymethyl)-, 8-methyl-8-azabicyclo [3.2.1] oct-3-yl ester, [3(S)-endo]-, sulfate (2:1), dihydrate with the following structure: Each tablet also contains as inactive ingredients: corn starch, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, stearic acid, and FD&C blue #1, and D&C yellow #10."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. HHyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3\u00bd hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Orally Disintegrating Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS In the presence of high environmental temperature, heat prostration can occur with drug use (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating). Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients: Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions: Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer hyoscyamine sulfate before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy-Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required. When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high, there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications\u2019 suppression of sweat gland activity. A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics. Geriatric Use: Geriatric patients may respond to usual doses of anticholinergics with excitement, agitation, drowsiness, or confusion. Geriatric patients are especially susceptible to the anticholinergic side effects, such as constipation, dryness of mouth, and urinary retention (especially in males). If these side effects occur and continue or are severe, medication should probably be discontinued. Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients, because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma. Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients, especially those who already have memory problems, with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine, which is responsible for many functions of the brain, including memory functions."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Use caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflex esophagitis. Use extreme caution and only when needed in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Prolonged use of anticholinergics may decrease or inhibit salivary flow, thus contributing to the development of caries, periodontal disease, oral candidiasis, and discomfort. Information for Patients: This medication should be taken 30 minutes to one hour before meals. This medication should be used with caution during exercise or hot weather; overheating may result in heat stroke. Hyoscyamine may cause drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision; patients should observe caution before driving, using machinery or performing other tasks requiring mental alertness. Drug Interactions: Absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with anticholinergics due to decreased gastrointestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying. Drug interactions may occur when anticholinergics are used with the following medications: antacids, antidiarrheals (adsorbent), other anticholinergics, antimyasthenics, cyclopropane, haloperidol, ketoconazole, metoclopramide, opioid (narcotic) analgesics, and potassium chloride. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine crosses the placenta. This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: This product is excreted in human milk. This product should not be administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: This product is not recommended for use in children under twelve years of age. Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics. Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required.

      "DESCRIPTION Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets contain 0.125 mg hyoscyamine sulfate formulated for sublingual administration. However, the tablets may be chewed or taken orally. Hyoscyamine sulfate is one of the principal anticholinergic/antispasmodic components of belladonna alkaloids.

Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sinoatrial node, the atrioventricular node and the exocrine glands. At therapeutic doses, it is completely devoid of any action on the autonomic ganglia. Hyoscyamine sulfate inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion. Hyoscyamine sulfate also controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions. Hyoscyamine sulfate is absorbed totally and completely by oral administration. Once absorbed, hyoscyamine sulfate disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body. The half-life of hyoscyamine sulfate is 2 to 3 1/2 hours. Hyoscyamine sulfate is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours. Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk. Hyoscyamine sulfate passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier. The tablets can be taken orally with the same pharmacological effects occurring; however, the effects may not occur as rapidly as with sublingual administration."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are effective as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer. They can also be used to control gastric secretions, visceral spasm and hypermotility in spastic colitis, spastic bladder, cystitis, pylorospasm and associated abdominal cramps. May be used in functional intestinal disorders to reduce symptoms such as those seen in mild dysenteries, diverticulitis and acute enterocolitis. For use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and functional gastrointestinal disorders. Also used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of neurogenic bladder and neurogenic bowel disturbances (including the splenic flexure syndrome and neurogenic colon). Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are indicated along with morphine or other narcotics in symptomatic relief of biliary and renal colic; as a \u201cdrying agent\u201d in the relief of symptoms of acute rhinitis; in the therapy of parkinsonism to reduce rigidity and tremors and to control associated sialorrhea and hyperhidrosis.

In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful. Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs including hyoscyamine sulfate. CNS signs and symptoms include confusion, disorientation, short-term memory loss, hallucinations, dysarthria, ataxia, coma, euphoria, anxiety, decreased anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, agitation and mannerisms and inappropriate affect. These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 48 hours after discontinuation of the drug."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis. Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution. Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets before meals; antacids after meals. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to determine the carcinogenic, mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential of hyoscyamine sulfate; however, 40 years of marketing experience with hyoscyamine sulfate shows no demonstrable evidence of a problem. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hyoscyamine sulfate. It is also not known whether hyoscyamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Hyoscyamine sulfate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Use with caution in patients with: autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension and renal disease. Investigate any tachycardia before giving any anticholinergic drugs since they may increase the heart rate. Use with caution in patients with hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis."
    ],
    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Like other anticholinergic agents, hyoscyamine sulfate may produce drowsiness, dizziness or blurred vision. In this event, the patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug. Use of hyoscyamine sulfate may decrease sweating resulting in heat prostration, fever or heat stroke; febrile patients or those who may be exposed to elevated environmental temperatures should use caution."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade may occur when hyoscyamine sulfate is administered concomitantly with other antimuscarinics, amantadine, haloperidol, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants or some antihistamines. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of hyoscyamine sulfate. Administer Hyoscyamine Sulfate Sublingual Tablets before meals; antacids after meals."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of overdose are headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dilated pupils, hot dry skin, dizziness, dryness of the mouth, difficulty in swallowing and CNS stimulation. Measures to be taken are immediate lavage of the stomach and injection of physostigmine 0.5 to 2 mg intravenously and repeated as necessary up to a total of 5 mg. Fever may be treated symptomatically (tepid water sponge baths, hypothermic blanket). Excitement to a degree which demands attention may be managed with sodium thiopental 2% solution given slowly intravenously or chloral hydrate (100-200 mL of a 2% solution) by rectal infusion. In the event of progression of the curare-like effect to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, artificial respiration should be instituted and maintained until effective respiratory action returns. In rats, the LD 50 for hyoscyamine is 375 mg/kg. Hyoscyamine sulfate is dialyzable."
