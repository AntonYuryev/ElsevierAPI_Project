      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: o Reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Consider periodic evaluations for HPA axis suppression if Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is applied to large surface areas or used under occlusion. If HPA axis suppression is noted, reduce the application frequency, discontinue use, or switch to a lower potency corticosteroid. (5.1, 8.4) o Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. (5.1, 8.4) o Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios. (5.1, 8.4) \u2022 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. (5.2) \u2022 Skin Infections: Initiate appropriate therapy if concomitant skin infections develop. (5.3) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, can cause systemic adverse reactions including reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Such patients should be considered for periodic evaluation of the HPA axis. This may be done by using cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24 ) stimulation testing (CST). If HPA axis suppression is noted, reduce the frequency of application or discontinue Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Studies conducted in pediatric subjects demonstrated reversible HPA axis suppression after use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion due to their larger skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Cushing's Syndrome, Hyperglycemia, and Glucosuria Systemic adverse reactions of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may also include manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Minimize systemic corticosteroid adverse reactions by mitigating the risk factors for increased systemic absorption and using Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . 5.2 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in post-marketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Avoid contact of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.3 Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. If skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, can cause allergic contact dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate patch testing. Discontinue Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion if the diagnosis is established ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no controlled or large-scale epidemiologic studies with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion in pregnant women, and available data on hydrocortisone butyrate use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, when administered subcutaneously or topically to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice, hydrocortisone butyrate induced adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, including abortion, fetal death, malformation, delayed ossification, decrease in fetal weight, and delay in sexual maturation (see Data) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of hydrocortisone butyrate observed in animal studies and the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day included increased ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation were noted at 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. Increased abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day. In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal toxicities (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. Additional fetal effects included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and increased fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity or malformation was observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal death and fetal resorption and an increase in ossification of caudal vertebrae were noted at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at 1 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day. No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorption was noted in rabbits and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity was noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity was observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established. No treatment-related malformation was noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits. A peri- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u22651.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related fetal toxicity was noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day. A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of hydrocortisone butyrate in human or animal milk, effects on the breastfed infant, or effects on milk production. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women to wash off prior to breastfeeding any Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion that has been applied to the areas at risk for direct infant contact. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older. Use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial in 284 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age. Endocrine Adverse Reactions Eighty-four (84) pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis affecting at least 25% of body surface area (BSA) treated with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion three times daily for up to 4 weeks were assessed for HPA axis suppression. The disease severity (moderate to severe atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (three times daily) in this HPA axis trial were different from the subject population (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (twice daily) for which Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is indicated. Seven of the 82 evaluable subjects (8.5%) demonstrated laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, where the criterion for defining HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 mcg/dL after cosyntropin stimulation. Subjects with HPA axis suppression ranged from 1 to 12 years of age and, at the time of enrollment, had 35% to 90% BSA involvement. These subjects did not develop any other signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression. At the first follow-up visit, approximately 1 month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by the second post-treatment visit, 55 days post-treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of higher skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . They are therefore also at a greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing\u2019s syndrome while on treatment. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels to an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin, occlusive dressings, or widespread application may increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids."

Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression Eighty-four (84) pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis affecting at least 25% of body surface area (BSA) treated with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion three times daily for up to 4 weeks were assessed for HPA axis suppression. The disease severity (moderate to severe atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (three times daily) in this HPA axis trial were different from the subject population (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (twice daily) for which Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is indicated. Seven of the 82 evaluable subjects (8.5%) demonstrated laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, where the criterion for defining HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 mcg/dL after cosyntropin stimulation. Subjects with HPA axis suppression ranged from 1 to 12 years of age and, at the time of enrollment, had 35% to 90% BSA involvement. These subjects did not develop any other signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression. At the first follow-up visit, approximately 1 month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by the second post-treatment visit, 55 days post-treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics No studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin, occlusive dressings, or widespread application may increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids."

No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 0.3 mg/kg/day in males and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females. Hydrocortisone butyrate revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test and L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (mouse micronucleus assay). No evidence of impairment of fertility or effect on mating performance was observed in a fertility and general reproductive performance study conducted in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 1.8 mg/kg/day. Mild effects on maternal animals, such as reduced food consumption and a subsequent reduction in body weight gain, were seen at doses \u22650.6 mg/kg/day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Consider periodic evaluations for HPA axis suppression if hydrocortisone butyrate lotion is applied to large surface areas or used under occlusion. If HPA axis suppression is noted, reduce the application frequency, discontinue use, or switch to a lower potency corticosteroid. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin surface-to-body-mass ratios. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Initiate appropriate therapy if concomitant skin infections develop. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may include reversible HPA axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Studies conducted in pediatric subjects demonstrated reversible HPA axis suppression after use of hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of hydrocortisone butyrate lotion due to their larger skin surface-to-body mass ratios [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4) ]. Patients applying a topical corticosteroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be considered for periodic evaluation of the HPA axis. This may be done by using cosyntropin (ACTH 1 to 24 ) stimulation testing (CST). Minimize systemic corticosteroid effects by mitigating the risk factors for increased systemic absorption and using hydrocortisone butyrate lotion as recommended [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) ]. If HPA axis suppression is noted, the frequency of application should be reduced or the drug should be withdrawn, or a less potent corticosteroid should be substituted. Signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ]. 5.2 Concomitant Skin Infections If skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal, antibacterial or antiviral agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of hydrocortisone butyrate lotion should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ]. 5.3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate patch testing. Discontinue hydrocortisone butyrate lotion if the diagnosis is established [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: HPA axis suppression. This has been observed in pediatric subjects using hydrocortisone butyrate lotion [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4) ] Concomitant skin infections [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2) ] Allergic contact dermatitis [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (>1%) are application site reactions. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 and/or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety data derived from hydrocortisone butyrate lotion clinical trials reflect exposure to hydrocortisone butyrate lotion twice daily for up to four weeks in separate clinical trials involving pediatric subjects 3 months to 18 years of age and adult subjects 18 years of age and older with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Adverse reactions shown in the tables below include those for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship to hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. Although the rates of application site reactions in the vehicle group were greater than those in the hydrocortisone butyrate lotion group in both studies, these rates are included in the tables (Table 1 and Table 2) because skin irritation is a known adverse reaction of topical corticosteroids.

The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions included: irritation, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, miliaria and telangiectasia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, hydrocortisone butyrate lotion should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. Note: The animal multiples of human exposure calculations in this label were based on body surface area comparisons for an adult (i.e., mg/m 2 /day dose comparisons) assuming 100% human percutaneous absorption of a maximum topical human dose (MTHD) for hydrocortisone butyrate lotion (25 g lotion). Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 to 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2X MTHD) included an increased incidence of ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 5.4 mg/kg/day and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively (2X MTHD and 0.7X MTHD, respectively). Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 to 20. An increased incidence of abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day (0.1X MTHD). Additional indicators of embryofetal toxicity (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). Additional fetal effects noted in this study included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 to 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal deaths and fetal resorptions and an increase in the number of ossifications in caudal vertebrae were noted at a dose of 9 mg/kg/day (3X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.1X MTHD). Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 to 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively (0.2X MTHD and 0.1X MTHD, respectively). No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 to 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 to 18. A dose- dependent increase in fetal resorptions was noted in rabbits (0.2 to 2X MTHD) and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose (80X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embyrofetal toxicity were noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats (8 MTHD). A dose at which no treatment- related effects on embryofetal toxicity were observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established in this study. No treatment-related effects on teratogenicity were noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits (80X MTHD and 2X MTHD, respectively). A peri- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 \u2013 lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose- dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u2265 1.8 mg/kg/day (0.7X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on fetal toxicity were noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when hydrocortisone butyrate lotion is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below 3 months of age have not been established. Because of higher skin surface-to-body-mass ratios, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ] . They are therefore also at a greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing's syndrome while on treatment. Eighty-four (84) pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis affecting at least 25% of body surface area (BSA) treated with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion three times daily for up to 4 weeks were assessed for HPA axis suppression. The disease severity (moderate to severe atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (three times daily) in this HPA axis study were different from the subject population (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (two times daily) for which hydrocortisone butyrate lotion is indicated. Seven of the 82 evaluable subjects (8.5%) demonstrated laboratory evidence of suppression, where the sole criterion for defining HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 micrograms per deciliter after cosyntropin stimulation. Suppressed subjects ranged in age from 1 to 12 years and, at the time of enrollment, had 35% to 90% BSA involvement. These subjects did not develop any other signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression. At the first follow up visit, approximately one month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by the second post treatment visit, 55 days post-treatment. Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have also been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels to an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of hydrocortisone butyrate lotion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical corticosteroids is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics No studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin, occlusive dressings, or widespread application may increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical corticosteroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. (See PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pediatric Use ). If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Note: The animal multiples of human exposure calculations in this label were based on body surface area comparisons for an adult (i.e., mg/m 2 /day dose comparisons) assuming 100% human percutaneous absorption of a maximum topical human dose (MTHD) for hydrocortisone butyrate cream, ointment and topical solution (25 g). In a 2-year dermal rat carcinogenicity study with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion, hydrocortisone butyrate was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at topical doses of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg/day in males and 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.1% lotion). No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 0.3 mg/kg/day in males (0.1\u00d7 MTHD) and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). Hydrocortisone butyrate revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test and L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (mouse micronucleus assay). No evidence of impairment of fertility or effect on mating performance was observed in a fertility and general reproductive performance study conducted in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to and including 1.8 mg/kg/day (0.7\u00d7 MTHD). Mild effects on maternal animals, such as reduced food consumption and a subsequent reduction in body weight gain, were seen at doses \u22650.6 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). Pregnancy Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2\u00d7 MTHD) included an increased incidence of ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively (2\u00d7 MTHD and 0.7\u00d7 MTHD, respectively). Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. An increased incidence of abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day (0.1\u00d7 MTHD). Additional indicators of embryofetal toxicity (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). Additional fetal effects noted in this study included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal deaths and fetal resorptions and an increase in the number of ossifications in caudal vertebrae were noted at a dose of 9 mg/kg/day (3\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.1\u00d7 MTHD). Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively (0.2\u00d7 MTHD and 0.1\u00d7 MTHD, respectively). No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate cream and hydrocortisone butyrate topical solution. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorptions was noted in rabbits (0.2 \u2013 2\u00d7 MTHD) and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose (80\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats (8\u00d7 MTHD). A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established in this study. No treatment-related effects on teratogenicity were noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits (80\u00d7 MTHD and 2\u00d7 MTHD, respectively). A peri- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 \u2013 lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u22651.8 mg/kg/day (0.7\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on fetal toxicity were noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk, in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when topical corticosteroids are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen. Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children."

In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2\u00d7 MTHD) included an increased incidence of ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively (2\u00d7 MTHD and 0.7\u00d7 MTHD, respectively). Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. An increased incidence of abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day (0.1\u00d7 MTHD). Additional indicators of embryofetal toxicity (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). Additional fetal effects noted in this study included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal deaths and fetal resorptions and an increase in the number of ossifications in caudal vertebrae were noted at a dose of 9 mg/kg/day (3\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.1\u00d7 MTHD). Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively (0.2\u00d7 MTHD and 0.1\u00d7 MTHD, respectively). No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate cream and hydrocortisone butyrate topical solution. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorptions was noted in rabbits (0.2 \u2013 2\u00d7 MTHD) and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose (80\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats (8\u00d7 MTHD). A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established in this study. No treatment-related effects on teratogenicity were noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits (80\u00d7 MTHD and 2\u00d7 MTHD, respectively). A peri- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 \u2013 lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u22651.8 mg/kg/day (0.7\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on fetal toxicity were noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day (0.2\u00d7 MTHD). A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2\u00d7 MTHD). No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Topical corticosteroids share anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions. The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of topical corticosteroids is unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical corticosteroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA-axis suppression by using adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests. If HPA-axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA-axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. [See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use .] If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled. Information for Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. 2. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician. 4. Patients should report any signs of local adverse reactions especially under occlusive dressing. 5. Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants on a child being treated in the diaper area, as these garments may constitute occlusive dressings. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Note: The animal multiples of human exposure calculations in this label were based on body surface area comparisons for an adult (i.e., mg/m 2 /day dose comparisons) assuming 100% human percutaneous absorption of a maximum topical human dose (MTHD) for hydrocortisone butyrate ointment (25 g). In a 2-year dermal rat carcinogenicity study with LOCOID \u00ae lotion, hydrocortisone butyrate was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at topical doses of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg/day in males and 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.1% lotion). No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 0.3 mg/kg/day in males (0.1X MTHD) and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.2X MTHD). Hydrocortisone butyrate revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test and L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (mouse micronucleus assay). No evidence of impairment of fertility or effect on mating performance was observed in a fertility and general reproductive performance study conducted in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to and including 1.8 mg/kg/day (0.7X MTHD). Mild effects on maternal animals, such as reduced food consumption and a subsequent reduction in body weight gain, were seen at doses \u22650.6 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). Teratogenic Effects Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2X MTHD) included an increased incidence of ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively (2X MTHD and 0.7X MTHD, respectively). Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. An increased incidence of abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day (0.1X MTHD). Additional indicators of embryofetal toxicity (i.e., reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). Additional fetal effects noted in this study included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal deaths, fetal resorptions and an increase in the number of ossifications in caudal vertebrae were noted at a dose of 9 mg/kg/day (3X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.1X MTHD). Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively (0.2X MTHD and 0.1X MTHD, respectively). Topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorptions was noted in rabbits (0.2 \u2013 2X MTHD) and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose (80X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats (8X MTHD). A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established in this study. No treatment-related effects on teratogenicity were noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits (80X MTHD and 2X MTHD, respectively). A peri- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u22651.8 mg/kg/day (0.7X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on fetal toxicity were noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day.

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Note: The animal multiples of human exposure calculations in this label were based on body surface area comparisons for an adult (i.e., mg/m 2 /day dose comparisons) assuming 100% human percutaneous absorption of a maximum topical human dose (MTHD) for hydrocortisone butyrate ointment (25 g). In a 2-year dermal rat carcinogenicity study with LOCOID \u00ae lotion, hydrocortisone butyrate was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at topical doses of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg/day in males and 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.1% lotion). No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 0.3 mg/kg/day in males (0.1X MTHD) and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.2X MTHD). Hydrocortisone butyrate revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test and L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (mouse micronucleus assay). No evidence of impairment of fertility or effect on mating performance was observed in a fertility and general reproductive performance study conducted in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to and including 1.8 mg/kg/day (0.7X MTHD). Mild effects on maternal animals, such as reduced food consumption and a subsequent reduction in body weight gain, were seen at doses \u22650.6 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD)."

      "Teratogenic Effects Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day (2X MTHD) included an increased incidence of ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively (2X MTHD and 0.7X MTHD, respectively). Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. An increased incidence of abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day (0.1X MTHD). Additional indicators of embryofetal toxicity (i.e., reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). Additional fetal effects noted in this study included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal deaths, fetal resorptions and an increase in the number of ossifications in caudal vertebrae were noted at a dose of 9 mg/kg/day (3X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.1X MTHD). Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (0.2X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity or teratogenicity were noted at doses of 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively (0.2X MTHD and 0.1X MTHD, respectively). Topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorptions was noted in rabbits (0.2 \u2013 2X MTHD) and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose (80X MTHD). No treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats (8X MTHD). A dose at which no treatment-related effects on embryofetal toxicity were observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established in this study. No treatment-related effects on teratogenicity were noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits (80X MTHD and 2X MTHD, respectively). A peri- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats.

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endocrine System Adverse Reactions: Reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Consider periodic evaluations for HPA axis suppression if Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is applied to large surface areas or used under occlusion. If HPA axis suppression is noted, reduce the application frequency, discontinue use, or switch to a lower potency corticosteroid. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. ( 5.2 ) Skin Infections: Initiate appropriate therapy if concomitant skin infections develop. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, can cause systemic adverse reactions including reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Such patients should be considered for periodic evaluation of the HPA axis. This may be done by using cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24 ) stimulation testing (CST). If HPA axis suppression is noted, reduce the frequency of application or discontinue Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. Signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Studies conducted in pediatric subjects demonstrated reversible HPA axis suppression after use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion due to their larger skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Cushing\u2019s Syndrome, Hyperglycemia, and Glucosuria Systemic adverse reactions of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may also include manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Minimize systemic corticosteroid adverse reactions by mitigating the risk factors for increased systemic absorption and using Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 5.2 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in post-marketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Avoid contact of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.3 Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. If skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion, can cause allergic contact dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate patch testing. Discontinue Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion if the diagnosis is established ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no controlled or large-scale epidemiologic studies with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion in pregnant women, and available data on hydrocortisone butyrate use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, when administered subcutaneously or topically to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice, hydrocortisone butyrate induced adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, including abortion, fetal death, malformation, delayed ossification, decrease in fetal weight, and delay in sexual maturation ( see Data) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of hydrocortisone butyrate observed in animal studies and the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day included increased ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation were noted at 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. Increased abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day. In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal toxicities (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. Additional fetal effects included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and increased fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity or malformation was observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal death and fetal resorption and an increase in ossification of caudal vertebrae were noted at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at 1 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day. No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorption was noted in rabbits and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity was noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity was observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established. No treatment-related malformation was noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits. A peri- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u22651.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related fetal toxicity was noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day. A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of hydrocortisone butyrate in human or animal milk, effects on the breastfed infant, or effects on milk production. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk, use Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women to wash off prior to breastfeeding any Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion that has been applied to the areas at risk for direct infant contact. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older. Use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled trial in 284 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age. Endocrine Adverse Reactions Eighty-four (84) pediatric subjects (3 months to less than 18 years of age) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis affecting at least 25% of body surface area (BSA) treated with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion three times daily for up to 4 weeks were assessed for HPA axis suppression. The disease severity (moderate to severe atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (three times daily) in this HPA axis trial were different from the subject population (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (twice daily) for which Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion is indicated. Seven of the 82 evaluable subjects (8.5%) demonstrated laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, where the criterion for defining HPA axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 mcg/dL after cosyntropin stimulation. Subjects with HPA axis suppression ranged from 1 to 12 years of age and, at the time of enrollment, had 35% to 90% BSA involvement. These subjects did not develop any other signs or symptoms of HPA axis suppression. At the first follow-up visit, approximately 1 month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by the second post-treatment visit, 55 days post-treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )] . Because of higher skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . They are therefore also at a greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing\u2019s syndrome while on treatment. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels to an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no controlled or large-scale epidemiologic studies with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion in pregnant women, and available data on hydrocortisone butyrate use in pregnant women have not identified a drug associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, when administered subcutaneously or topically to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice, hydrocortisone butyrate induced adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, including abortion, fetal death, malformation, delayed ossification, decrease in fetal weight, and delay in sexual maturation ( see Data) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of hydrocortisone butyrate observed in animal studies and the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Lotion. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day included increased ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation were noted at 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 \u2013 20. Increased abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day. In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal toxicities (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. Additional fetal effects included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and increased fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity or malformation was observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal death and fetal resorption and an increase in ossification of caudal vertebrae were noted at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at 1 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day. No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate lotion. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 \u2013 18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorption was noted in rabbits and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity was noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity was observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established. No treatment-related malformation was noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits. A peri- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8 and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20.

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin, occlusive dressings, or widespread application may increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids."

( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, may increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist. ( 5.2 ) Skin Infections: Initiate appropriate therapy if concomitant skin infections develop. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Suppression Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, can cause systemic adverse reactions including HPA-axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Consider patients for periodic evaluation of the HPA axis. This may be done by using cosyntropin (ACTH1-24) stimulation testing (CST). If HPA-axis suppression is noted, reduce the frequency of application or withdraw Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, or substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Studies conducted in pediatric subjects demonstrated reversible HPA-axis suppression after use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% due to their larger skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Cushing\u2019s Syndrome, Hyperglycemia, and Glucosuria Systemic adverse reactions of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, may also include manifestations of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Additional Considerations for Endocrine Adverse Reactions Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Minimize systemic corticosteroid effects by mitigating the risk factors for increased systemic absorption and using Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. 5.2 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Avoid contact of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.3 Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. If skin infections are present or develop, use an appropriate antifungal, antibacterial or antiviral agent. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% until the infection has been adequately controlled. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids, including Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%, can cause allergic contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate patch testing. Discontinue Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% if the diagnosis is established.",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no controlled or large-scale epidemiologic studies with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% use in pregnant women, and available data on hydrocortisone butyrate use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriages or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, when administered subcutaneously or topically to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice, hydrocortisone butyrate induced adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, including abortion, fetal death, malformation, delayed ossification, decrease in fetal weight, and delay in sexual maturation (see Data) . The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of hydrocortisone butyrate observed in animal studies and the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 - 17. In the presence of maternal toxicity, fetal effects noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day included increased ossification variations and unossified sternebra. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation were noted at doses of 5.4 and 1.8 mg/kg/day, respectively. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 7 - 20. Increased abortion was noted at 0.3 mg/kg/day. In the absence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal body weight was noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal toxicities (reduction in litter size, decreased number of viable fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss) were noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. Additional fetal effects included delayed ossification noted at doses \u22650.1 mg/kg/day and increased fetal malformations (primarily skeletal malformations) noted at doses \u22650.2 mg/kg/day. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity or malformation was observed was not established in this study. Additional systemic embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and mice. Subcutaneous doses of 0.1 and 9 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 9 \u2013 15. In the presence of maternal toxicity, an increase in fetal death and fetal resorption and an increase in ossification of caudal vertebrae were noted at 9 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 0.1 mg/kg/day. Subcutaneous doses of 0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female mice during gestation days 7 \u2013 13. In the absence of maternal toxicity, an increased number of cervical ribs and one fetus with clubbed legs were noted at 1 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity or malformation was noted at 1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day. No topical embryofetal development studies were conducted with hydrocortisone butyrate cream. However, topical embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with a hydrocortisone butyrate ointment formulation. Topical doses of 1% and 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment were administered to pregnant female rats during gestation days 6 \u2013 15 or pregnant female rabbits during gestation days 6 -18. A dose-dependent increase in fetal resorption was noted in rabbits and fetal resorptions were noted in rats at the 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose. No treatment-related embryofetal toxicity was noted at the 1% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment dose in rats. A dose at which no embryofetal toxicity was observed in rabbits after topical administration of hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was not established. No treatment-related malformation was noted at a dose of 10% hydrocortisone butyrate ointment in rats or rabbits. A peri- and postnatal development study was conducted in rats. Subcutaneous doses of 0.6, 1.8, and 5.4 mg/kg/day hydrocortisone butyrate were administered to pregnant female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20. In the presence of maternal toxicity, a dose-dependent decrease in fetal weight was noted at doses \u22651.8 mg/kg/day). No treatment-related fetal toxicity was noted at 0.6 mg/kg/day. A delay in sexual maturation was noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on sexual maturation were noted at 1.8 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related effects on behavioral development or subsequent reproductive performance were noted at 5.4 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of hydrocortisone in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production after treatment with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1%. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Corticosteroid-Responsive Dermatoses The safety and efficacy of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% for relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses have not been established in pediatric patients. Atopic Dermatitis The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis have been established in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older. Use of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% for this indication is supported by evidence from a multicenter, randomized, vehicle-controlled trial of 264 pediatric subjects 3 months of age and older [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The safety and efficacy of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% for the topical treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age. Endocrine Adverse Reactions Eighty-six (86) subjects (between 5 months and 18 years of age) with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis affecting at least 25% of body surface area (BSA) treated with Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% 3 times daily for up to 4 weeks were assessed for HPA-axis suppression in two separate studies. Five of the 82 evaluable subjects (6.1%) demonstrated evidence of suppression, where the criterion for defining HPA-axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of \u226418 mcg/dL after cosyntropin stimulation. At the first follow-up visit, approximately 1 month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by 65 days post-treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Because of higher skin-surface-to-body-mass ratios, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA-axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . They are therefore also at a greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment and of Cushing\u2019s syndrome while on treatment. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels in response to ACTH stimulation. Linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have also been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects."

The disease severity (moderate to severe atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (3 times daily) in these HPA-axis trials were different from the subject population (mild to moderate atopic dermatitis) and the dosing regimen (2 times daily) for which Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% is indicated. Five of the 82 evaluable subjects (6.1%) demonstrated evidence of suppression, where the criterion for defining HPA-axis suppression was a serum cortisol level of \u226418 mcg/dL after cosyntropin stimulation. Suppressed subjects ranged in age from 5 months to 16 years and, at the time of enrollment, had 25% to 95% BSA involvement. These subjects did not demonstrate any clinical signs or symptoms despite evidence of HPA-axis suppression. At the first follow-up visit, approximately 1 month after the conclusion of treatment, cosyntropin stimulation results of all subjects had returned to normal, with the exception of one subject. This last subject recovered adrenal function by 65 days post-treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed through normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin, occlusive dressings, or widespread application may increase percutaneous absorption and increase the risk of HPA-axis suppression. The vasoconstrictor assay showed that Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream (lipid), 0.1% had a more pronounced skin blanching effect than Hydrocortisone Butyrate Cream, 0.1%, suggesting greater percutaneous absorption from the former. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year dermal rat carcinogenicity study with a hydrocortisone butyrate lotion formulation, hydrocortisone butyrate was administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at topical doses of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3 mg/kg/day in males and 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females (0.1% lotion). No drug-related tumors were noted in this study up to the highest doses evaluated in this study of 0.3 mg/kg/day in males and 0.5 mg/kg/day in females. Hydrocortisone butyrate revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames test and L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (mouse micronucleus assay). No evidence of impairment of fertility or effect on mating performance was observed in a fertility and general reproductive performance study conducted in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 1.8 mg/kg/day. Mild effects on maternal animals, such as reduced food consumption and a subsequent reduction in body weight gain, were seen at doses \u22650.6 mg/kg/day."
