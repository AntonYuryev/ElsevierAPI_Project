      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only ( 2.1 ) Acute treatment of migraine: single dose of 4 mg or 6 mg. ( 2.1 ) Acute treatment of cluster headache: single dose of 6 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 12 mg, separate doses by at least 1 hour. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, the lower dose of 4 mg may be used [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of lower doses has not been established. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 mg injections separated by at least 1 hour. A second 6 mg dose should only be considered if some response to a first injection was observed. 2.2 Administration Using the Sumatriptan injection Autoinjector An autoinjector device is available for use with 4-mg and 6-mg prefilled syringes. With this prefilled syringe autoinjector, the needle penetrates approximately 1/4 inch (5 to 6 mm). The injection is intended to be given subcutaneously, and intramuscular or intravascular delivery must be avoided. Instruct patients on the proper use of Sumatriptan injection autoinjector and direct them to use injection sites with an adequate skin and subcutaneous thickness to accommodate the length of the needle."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injection. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraines (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMITREX tablets, IMITREX nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively.

Overdoses would be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions (desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is about 2 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]; therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age : The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors : In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium.

The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 Study 4 Study 5 Placebo Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Placebo Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 39) (n = 39) (n = 88) (n = 92) Patients with pain relief (no/mild) 5 Minutes post- injection 8% 21% 7% 23% a 10 Minutes post- injection 10% 49% a 25% 49% a 15 Minutes post-injection 26% 74% a 35% 75% a a P<0.05. (n = Number of headaches treated.) An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours). sumatriptan-figure-1"

Revised:11/2025 Instructions for Use SUMATRIPTAN (SOO-ma-TRIP-tan) INJECTION AUTOINJECTOR Read this Patient Instructions for Use before you start to use Sumatriptan Autoinjector. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. You and your healthcare provider should talk about sumatriptan injection when you start taking it and at regular checkups. Keep the Sumatriptan Autoinjector out of the reach of children. A. ABOUT THE SUMATRIPTAN AUTOINJECTOR Sumatriptan autoinjector is available in 2 strengths. Check that the dose of Sumatriptan is the one prescribed for you by looking at the Sumatriptan carton and at the dose label on the Sumatriptan autoinjector. Sumatriptan autoinjectors are supplied in these 2 packaging presentations: Sumatriptan Autoinjector, 4 mg, with a green injector button. Sumatriptan Autoinjector, 6 mg, with a blue injector button. Sumatriptan Autoinjector Features: Before you use the Sumatriptan Autoinjector, important things that you need to know. This device is called an Autoinjector. 1. Read all of the instructions carefully before using this Autoinjector. 2. Follow these step-by-step instructions every time you use the Autoinjector. 3. Only use each Autoinjector once - do not try to use more than once. 4. Use the Autoinjector immediately once the cap has been removed; it is advised not to postpone the injection. If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. B. HOW TO USE THE SUMATRIPTAN AUTO INJECTOR TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE Step 1: Prepare for your injection 1.1) Put all of the items listed below within easy reach on a clean table or other stable surface: Disposable Sumatriptan Autoinjector Alcohol wipes/swabs Sharps disposal container 1.2) Wash and dry your hands 1.3) Open the tray over a clean table or other stable surface and remove disposable Sumatriptan Autoinjector. Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject because the Autoinjector could roll off the table and become unsterile. 1.4) Check the expiration date on the Autoinjector label and its carton. If the medication has expired, do not use it. 1.5) Examine the contents of the syringe carefully through the transparent housing. The liquid should be clear, colorless to pale yellow solution. 1.6) If you notice that Autoinjector appears to be damaged, do not use it and dispose off. Use another one or contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for assistance and suitable advice ( see Figure A ). Figure A Step 2: Choose and Prepare the Injection Site. 2.1) Before injecting your medicine, choose one area with a fatty tissue layer (see Figure B ). Figure B 2.2) Ask your healthcare provider if you have a question about where to inject your medicine. 2.3) To prepare the area of skin where Sumatriptan is to be injected, wipe the injection site with an alcohol swab ( see Figure C ). Figure C 2.4) Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Be sure to change the injection site with each dose. 2.5) Hold the Sumatriptan Autoinjector by the injector body ( see Figure D ) and pull off the needle cap. Figure D 2.6) Look inside the needle cap to make sure you see a black needle shield inside the cap ( see Figure E ). Figure E 2.7) Dispose of the needle cap and proceed to the injection step without delay. Warning If the Sumatriptan Autoinjector has been dropped more than 3 feet, or if it looks damaged for any reason, do not use it. Instead, dispose off it in an acceptable sharps disposal container and use a new Sumatriptan Autoinjector ( see Figure K ). Step 3: Administer your injection 3.1) Hold the Sumatriptan Autoinjector in your palm with your thumb above the injector button. 3.2) Place the Sumatriptan Autoinjector upright with the needle end flat against your skin at a 90\u00b0 angle ( see Figure F ). Figure F 3.3) Push the Sumatriptan Autoinjector against your skin until you feel resistance or stop point. Pushing to the stop point unblocks the injector button. 3.4) Keep the Sumatriptan Autoinjector pressed firmly against the skin and use your thumb to push the injector button ( see Figure G ). You will hear a click, which means the injection has begun. Figure G 3.5) With the Autoinjector still hold firmly against the skin, observe the plunger movement. When the movement stops, the injection is completed. Keep holding Autoinjector against the skin at least for 5 seconds ( see Figure H ). Figure H 3.6) If the Autoinjector is taken away from your skin too soon, you will not receive all the medicine or it may leak out of the Autoinjector. 3.7) Monitor the injection through the Transparent Syringe Housing to make sure that the entire dose is injected ( see Figure I ). Figure I 3.8) Remove Autoinjector straight up from the injection site. 3.9) The safety guard automatically covers the needle. It is then locked and the needle is protected ( see Figure J ). Figure J 3.10) Before disposing of Autoinjector check visually that there is no liquid left in the syringe, at the bottom of the transparent syringe housing. 3.11) If the medication has been incompletely injected, consult your doctor. Step 4: Disposal of your injection Discard the used Autoinjector as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist into sharps disposal container right away after use ( see Figure K ). Figure K Do not throw away or dispose off Autoinjector in your household trash. Dispose used alcohol wipes/swab in sharps disposal container. Keep the sharps disposal container out of the sight and reach of children. Do not try to reuse the autoinjector. Store Autoinjector away from direct sunlight. If someone around you is injured by the needle, consult your doctor. For any problems or questions, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only ( 2.1 ) Acute treatment of migraine: single dose of 4 mg or 6 mg. ( 2.1 ) Acute treatment of cluster headache: single dose of 6 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 12 mg, separate doses by at least 1 hour. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, the lower dose of 4 mg may be used [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of lower doses has not been established. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 mg injections separated by at least 1 hour. A second 6 mg dose should only be considered if some response to a first injection was observed. 2.2 Administration Using the Sumatriptan injection Autoinjector An autoinjector device is available for use with 4-mg and 6-mg prefilled syringes. With this prefilled syringe autoinjector, the needle penetrates approximately 1/4 inch (5 to 6 mm). The injection is intended to be given subcutaneously, and intramuscular or intravascular delivery must be avoided. Instruct patients on the proper use of Sumatriptan injection autoinjector and direct them to use injection sites with an adequate skin and subcutaneous thickness to accommodate the length of the needle."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injection. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraines (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMITREX tablets, IMITREX nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group.

Overdoses would be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions (desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is about 2 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]; therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age : The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors : In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium.

Proportion of Patients with Pain Relief and Relief of Migraine Symptoms after 1 and 2 Hours of Treatment in Studies 2 and 3 1-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo (n = 190) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 384) Placebo (n = 180) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 350) Patients with pain relief (Grade 0/1) 18% 70% a 26% 70% a Patients with no pain 5% 48% a 13% 49% a Patients without nausea 48% 73% a 50% 73% a Patients without photophobia 23% 56% a 25% 58% a Patients with little or no clinical disability b 34% 76% a 34% 76% a 2-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo c Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg d Placebo c Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg d Patients with pain relief (Grade 0/1) 31% 81% a 39% 82% a Patients with no pain 11% 63% a 19% 65% a Patients without nausea 56% 82% a 63% 81% a Patients without photophobia 31% 72% a 35% 71% a Patients with little or no clinical disability b 42% 85% a 49% 84% a a P<0.05 versus placebo. b A successful outcome in terms of clinical disability was defined prospectively as ability to work mildly impaired or ability to work and function normally. c Includes patients that may have received an additional placebo injection 1 hour after the initial injection. d Includes patients that may have received an additional 6 mg of sumatriptan injection 1 hour after the initial injection. Sumatriptan injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. Similar efficacy was seen when patients self-administered sumatriptan injection using the sumatriptan injection autoinjector. The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 Study 4 Study 5 Placebo Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Placebo Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 39) (n = 39) (n = 88) (n = 92) Patients with pain relief (no/mild) 5 Minutes post- injection 8% 21% 7% 23% a 10 Minutes post- injection 10% 49% a 25% 49% a 15 Minutes post-injection 26% 74% a 35% 75% a a P<0.05. (n = Number of headaches treated.) An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours). sumatriptan-figure-1"

ABOUT THE SUMATRIPTAN AUTOINJECTOR Sumatriptan autoinjector is available in 2 strengths.

Sumatriptan autoinjectors are supplied in these 2 packaging presentations: Sumatriptan Autoinjector, 4 mg, with a green injector button. Sumatriptan Autoinjector, 6 mg, with a blue injector button. Sumatriptan Autoinjector Features: Before you use the Sumatriptan Autoinjector, important things that you need to know. This device is called an Autoinjector. 1. Read all of the instructions carefully before using this Autoinjector. 2. Follow these step-by-step instructions every time you use the Autoinjector. 3. Only use each Autoinjector once - do not try to use more than once. 4. Use the Autoinjector immediately once the cap has been removed; it is advised not to postpone the injection. If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. B. HOW TO USE THE SUMATRIPTAN AUTO INJECTOR TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE Step 1: Prepare for your injection 1.1) Put all of the items listed below within easy reach on a clean table or other stable surface: Disposable Sumatriptan Autoinjector Alcohol wipes/swabs Sharps disposal container 1.2) Wash and dry your hands 1.3) Open the tray over a clean table or other stable surface and remove disposable Sumatriptan Autoinjector. Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject because the Autoinjector could roll off the table and become unsterile. 1.4) Check the expiration date on the Autoinjector label and its carton. If the medication has expired, do not use it. 1.5) Examine the contents of the syringe carefully through the transparent housing. The liquid should be clear, colorless to pale yellow solution. 1.6) If you notice that Autoinjector appears to be damaged, do not use it and dispose off. Use another one or contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for assistance and suitable advice ( see Figure A ). Figure A Step 2: Choose and Prepare the Injection Site. 2.1) Before injecting your medicine, choose one area with a fatty tissue layer (see Figure B ). Figure B 2.2) Ask your healthcare provider if you have a question about where to inject your medicine. 2.3) To prepare the area of skin where Sumatriptan is to be injected, wipe the injection site with an alcohol swab ( see Figure C ). Figure C 2.4) Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Be sure to change the injection site with each dose. 2.5) Hold the Sumatriptan Autoinjector by the injector body ( see Figure D ) and pull off the needle cap. Figure D 2.6) Look inside the needle cap to make sure you see a black needle shield inside the cap ( see Figure E ). Figure E 2.7) Dispose of the needle cap and proceed to the injection step without delay. Warning If the Sumatriptan Autoinjector has been dropped more than 3 feet, or if it looks damaged for any reason, do not use it. Instead, dispose off it in an acceptable sharps disposal container and use a new Sumatriptan Autoinjector ( see Figure K ). Step 3: Administer your injection 3.1) Hold the Sumatriptan Autoinjector in your palm with your thumb above the injector button. 3.2) Place the Sumatriptan Autoinjector upright with the needle end flat against your skin at a 90\u00b0 angle ( see Figure F ). Figure F 3.3) Push the Sumatriptan Autoinjector against your skin until you feel resistance or stop point. Pushing to the stop point unblocks the injector button. 3.4) Keep the Sumatriptan Autoinjector pressed firmly against the skin and use your thumb to push the injector button ( see Figure G ). You will hear a click, which means the injection has begun. Figure G 3.5) With the Autoinjector still hold firmly against the skin, observe the plunger movement. When the movement stops, the injection is completed. Keep holding Autoinjector against the skin at least for 5 seconds ( see Figure H ). Figure H 3.6) If the Autoinjector is taken away from your skin too soon, you will not receive all the medicine or it may leak out of the Autoinjector. 3.7) Monitor the injection through the Transparent Syringe Housing to make sure that the entire dose is injected ( see Figure I ). Figure I 3.8) Remove Autoinjector straight up from the injection site. 3.9) The safety guard automatically covers the needle. It is then locked and the needle is protected ( see Figure J ). Figure J 3.10) Before disposing of Autoinjector check visually that there is no liquid left in the syringe, at the bottom of the transparent syringe housing. 3.11) If the medication has been incompletely injected, consult your doctor. Step 4: Disposal of your injection Discard the used Autoinjector as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist into sharps disposal container right away after use ( see Figure K ). Figure K Do not throw away or dispose off Autoinjector in your household trash. Dispose used alcohol wipes/swab in sharps disposal container. Keep the sharps disposal container out of the sight and reach of children. Do not try to reuse the autoinjector. Store Autoinjector away from direct sunlight. If someone around you is injured by the needle, consult your doctor. For any problems or questions, contact your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Single dose of 25-mg, 50-mg, or 100-mg tablet. ( 2.1 ) A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25-mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50-mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use After Sumatriptan Injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonist has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data) . In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data ) . There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data) . In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data ) .

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5- and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20-mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25-mg dose). Effect of Food A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Male and Female Patients In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [ see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after co-administration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after co-administration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50-mg or 100-mg group when compared with the 25-mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50-mg and 100-mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Mild or No Headache) 2 and 4 Hours Following Treatment Sumatriptan Tablets 25 mg Sumatriptan Tablets 50 mg Sumatriptan Tablets 100 mg Placebo 2 hr 4 hr 2 hr 4 hr 2 hr 4 hr 2 hr 4 hr Trial 1 52% P < 0.05 in comparison with placebo. 67% 61% , P < 0.05 in comparison with 25 mg. 78% , 62% , 79% , 27% 38% (n = 298) (n = 296) (n = 296) (n = 94) Trial 2 52% 70% 50% 68% 56% 71% 26% 38% (n = 66) (n = 62) (n = 66) (n = 65) Trial 3 52% 65% 54% 72% 57% 78% 17% 19% (n = 48) (n = 46) (n = 46) (n = 47) The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment in pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose of Sumatriptan Tablets or Other Medication to Treat Migraine Over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. Figure 1.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Single dose of 25-mg, 50-mg, or 100-mg tablet. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25-mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50-mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use After Sumatriptan Injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonist has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data) . In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data ) . There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5- and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20-mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25-mg dose). Effect of Food A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Male and Female Patients In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [ see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after co-administration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after co-administration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50-mg or 100-mg group when compared with the 25-mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50-mg and 100-mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

Figure 1. Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose of Sumatriptan Tablets or Other Medication to Treat Migraine Over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants).

      "2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14)]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24 hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30 day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with: Ischemic coronary artery disease (CAD) (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or coronary artery vasospasm, including Prinzmetal\u2019s angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] History of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) or history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine because these patients are at a higher risk of stroke [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Peripheral vascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Ischemic bowel disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Uncontrolled hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Recent use (i.e., within 24 hours) of ergotamine-containing medication, ergot-type medication (such as dihydroergotamine or methysergide), or another 5-hydroxytryptamine1 (5-HT1) agonist [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.3)] Concurrent administration of a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitor or recent (within 2 weeks) use of an MAO-A inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] Hypersensitivity to sumatriptan (angioedema and anaphylaxis seen) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]"
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5\u2011HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

      "7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO\u2011A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7 fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO\u2011A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5\u2011HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73 to 1.91 fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age\u2011 dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14\u2011year\u2011old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "Patients in clinical trials (N = 670) received single oral doses of 140 to 300 mg without significant adverse reactions. Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5\u2011HT1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5\u2011HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro\u2011inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmax following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine\u2011free period, but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food:A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high\u2011 fat meal indicated that the Cmax and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and Cmax and a Tmax 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and half\u2011life. Racial Groups:The systemic clearance and Cmax of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors:Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2 fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7 fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60 week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no\u2011effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose of Sumatriptan Tablets or Other Medication to Treat Migraine over the 24 Hours following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3a [Figure 2] a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy."

Do not take more than 200 mg of sumatriptan tablets in a 24 hour period. If you take too much sumatriptan, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. You should write down when you have headaches and when you take sumatriptan tablets so you can talk with your healthcare provider about how sumatriptan tablets are working for you. What should I avoid while taking sumatriptan tablets? Sumatriptan tablets can cause dizziness, weakness, or drowsiness. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything where you need to be alert. What are the possible side effects of sumatriptan tablets? Sumatriptan tablets may cause serious side effects. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about sumatriptan tablets?\u201d These serious side effects include: changes in color or sensation in your fingers and toes (Raynaud\u2019s syndrome) stomach and intestinal problems (gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events). Symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events include: sudden or severe stomach pain nausea or vomiting stomach pain after meals constipation or diarrhea weight loss bloody diarrhea fever problems with blood circulation to your legs and feet (peripheral vascular ischemia). Symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia include: cramping and pain in your legs or hips feeling of heaviness or tightness in your leg muscles burning or aching pain in your feet or toes while resting numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs cold feeling or color changes in 1 or both legs or feet medication overuse headaches. Some people who use too many sumatriptan tablets may have worse headaches (medication overuse headache). If your headaches get worse, your healthcare provider may decide to stop your treatment with sumatriptan tablets. serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious problem that can happen in people using sumatriptan tablets, especially if sumatriptan tablets are used with anti-depressant medicines called SSRIs or SNRIs. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of serotonin syndrome: mental changes such as seeing things that are not there (hallucinations), agitation, or coma fast heartbeat changes in blood pressure high body temperature tight muscles trouble walking hives (itchy bumps); swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat seizures. Seizures have happened in people taking sumatriptan tablets who have never had seizures before. Talk with your healthcare provider about your chance of having seizures while you take sumatriptan tablets. The most common side effects of sumatriptan tablets include: tingling or numbness in your fingers or toes warm or cold feeling feeling weak, drowsy, or tired pain, discomfort, or stiffness in your neck, throat, jaw, or chest dizziness Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only. (2.1) Acute treatment of migraine: single dose of 4 to 6 mg (2.1) Acute treatment of cluster headache: single dose of 6 mg (2.1) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 12 mg, separate doses by at least 1 hour. (2.1) 2.1 Dosing Information The maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, the lower dose of 4 mg may be used [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of lower doses has not been established. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 mg injections separated by at least 1 hour. A second 6 mg dose should only be considered if some response to a first injection was observed. 2.2 Administration Using the Sumatriptan Autoinjector An autoinjector device (sumatriptan autoinjector) is available for use with 6 mg prefilled syringe to facilitate self-administration in patients using the 6 mg dose. With this device, the needle penetrates approximately 1/4 inch (5 to 6 mm). The injection is intended to be given subcutaneously, and intramuscular or intravascular delivery must be avoided.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and /or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional injections of sumatriptan. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraines (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3)] . 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]).

Overdoses would be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions (desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is about 2 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ; therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6 mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b115 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15\u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age :The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium.

Sumatriptan injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. Similar efficacy was seen when patients self-administered sumatriptan injection using the sumatriptan autoinjector. The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 Study 4 Study 5 Placebo (n = 39) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 39) Placebo (n = 88) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 92) Patients with pain relief (no/mild) 5 Minutes post-injection 8% 21% 7% 23% a 10 Minutes post-injection 10% 49% a 25% 49% a 15 Minutes post-injection 26% 74% a 35% 75% a a P<0.05. n = Number of headaches treated An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours)."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injection. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine patients (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine (Studies 2 and 3) a Includes injection site pain, stinging/burning, swelling, erythema, bruising, bleeding.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of sumatriptan injection in pregnant women. In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal. Sumatriptan injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 100 times the single maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately 50 and 2 times, respectively, the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 80 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 100 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 160 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs 12 to 17 years of age who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

Overdoses would be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions (desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is about 2 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]; therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan's development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Hepatic Impairment The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Race The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Hepatic Impairment The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Race The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat in which sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the highest dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day or approximately 100 times the single human dose of 6 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 3 times the human exposure after a 6-mg subcutaneous dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1,000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3, onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6-mg sumatriptan injection. Lower doses of sumatriptan injection may also prove effective, although the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses. In Study 1, 6 different doses of sumatriptan injection (n = 30 each group) were compared with placebo (n = 62), in a single-attack, parallel-group design, the dose-response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Proportion of Patients with Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Reactions by Time and by Sumatriptan Injection Dose in Study 1 a Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication.

Headache relief, as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in 70% of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan injection. Approximately 82% and 65% of patients treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours, respectively. Table 3 shows the 1- and 2-hour efficacy results for sumatriptan injection 6 mg in Studies 2 and 3. Table 3. Proportion of Patients with Pain Relief and Relief of Migraine Symptoms after 1 and 2 Hours of Treatment in Studies 2 and 3 a P <0.05 versus placebo. b A successful outcome in terms of clinical disability was defined prospectively as ability to work mildly impaired or ability to work and function normally. c Includes patients that may have received an additional placebo injection 1 hour after the initial injection. d Includes patients that may have received an additional 6 mg of sumatriptan injection 1 hour after the initial injection. 1-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo (n = 190) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 384) Placebo (n = 180) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 350) Patients with pain relief (grade 0/1) 18% 70% a 26% 70% a Patients with no pain 5% 48% a 13% 49% a Patients without nausea 48% 73% a 50% 73% a Patients without photophobia 23% 56% a 25% 58% a Patients with little or no clinical disability b 34% 76% a 34% 76% a 2-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo c Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg d Placebo c Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg d Patients with pain relief (grade 0/1) 31% 81% a 39% 82% a Patients with no pain 11% 63% a 19% 65% a Patients without nausea 56% 82% a 63% 81% a Patients without photophobia 31% 72% a 35% 71% a Patients with little or no clinical disability b 42% 85% a 49% 84% a Sumatriptan injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients 21 to 65 years of age were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 a P<0.05. (n = Number of headaches treated.) Study 4 Study 5 Placebo Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Placebo Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 39) (n = 39) (n = 88) (n = 92) Patients with pain relief (no/mild) 5 Minutes post-injection 8% 21% 7% 23% a 10 Minutes post-injection 10% 49% a 25% 49% a 15 Minutes post-injection 26% 74% a 35% 75% a An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and /or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascularischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain andbloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experiencesymptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections.1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional injections of sumatriptan. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraines (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically 359 significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6 mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b115 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15\u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60 week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 3 times the human exposure after a 6 mg subcutaneous dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1,000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3, onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6 mg sumatriptan injection. Lower doses of sumatriptan injection may also prove effective, although the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses. In Study 1, 6 different doses of sumatriptan injection (n = 30 each group) were compared with placebo (n = 62), in a single-attack, parallel-group design, the dose-response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Proportion of Patients with Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Reactions by Time and by Sumatriptan Dose in Study 1 Percent Patients with Relief a Dose of Sumatriptan Injection at 10 Minutes at 30 Minutes at 1 Hour at 2 Hours Adverse Reactions Incidence (%) Placebo 5 15 24 21 55 1 mg 10 40 43 40 63 2 mg 7 23 57 43 63 3 mg 17 47 57 60 77 4 mg 13 37 50 57 80 6 mg 10 63 73 70 83 8 mg 23 57 80 83 93 a Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication. In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of sumatriptan injection 6 mg in 1,104 patients with moderate or severe migraine pain (Studies 2 and 3), the onset of relief was less than 10 minutes. Headache relief, as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in 70% of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan injection. Approximately 82% and 65% of patients treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours, respectively. Table 3 shows the 1- and 2-hour efficacy results for sumatriptan injection 6 mg in Studies 2 and 3. Table 3.

Sumatriptan injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. Similar efficacy was seen when patients self-administered sumatriptan injection using the sumatriptan autoinjector. The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4.

Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours)."

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction, Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina, Other Vasospasm-Related Events, Arrhythmias, and Cerebrovascular Events Inform patients that sumatriptan injection may cause serious cardiovascular side effects such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Although serious cardiovascular events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, significant rise in blood pressure, weakness, and slurring of speech and should ask for medical advice if any indicative sign or symptoms are observed. Apprise patients of the importance of this follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 )]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Concomitant Use with Other Triptans or Ergot Medications Inform patients that use of sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of another triptan or an ergot-type medication (including dihydroergotamine or methysergide) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.3 )]. Serotonin Syndrome Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan injection or other triptans, particularly during combined use with SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Medication Overuse Headache Inform patients that use of acute migraine drugs for 10 or more days per month may lead to an exacerbation of headache and encourage patients to record headache frequency and drug use (e.g., by keeping a headache diary) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Pregnancy Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant during treatment or plan to become pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ]. Lactation Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ]. Ability to Perform Complex Tasks Treatment with sumatriptan injection may cause somnolence and dizziness; instruct patients to evaluate their ability to perform complex tasks after administration of sumatriptan injection. How to Use Sumatriptan Injection Instruct patients to read the Instructions for Use before starting therapy. Provide patients instruction on the proper use of sumatriptan injection if they are able to self-administer sumatriptan injection in medicaly unsupervised situations. Instruct patients on storage and disposal of the pen [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Inform patients that the needle in the sumatriptan autoinjector penetrates approximately 1/4 of an inch (5 to 6 mm). Inform patients that the injection is intended to be given subcutaneously and intramuscular or intravascular delivery should be avoided.

Sumatriptan can cause serious side effects, including: Heart attack and other heart problems. Heart problems may lead to death. Stop taking sumatriptan and get emergency medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms of a heart attack: discomfort in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back severe tightness, pain, pressure, or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw pain or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort breaking out in a cold sweat nausea or vomiting feeling lightheaded Sumatriptan is not for people with risk factors for heart disease unless a heart exam is done and shows no problem. You have a higher risk for heart disease if you: have high blood pressure have high cholesterol levels smoke are overweight have diabetes have a family history of heart disease What is sumatriptan? Sumatriptan injection is a prescription medicine used to treat acute migraine headaches with or without aura and acute cluster headaches in adults who have been diagnosed with migraine or cluster headaches. Sumatriptan is not used to treat other types of headaches such as hemiplegic (that make you unable to move on one side of your body) or basilar (rare form of migraine with aura) migraines. Sumatriptan is not used to prevent or decrease the number of migraine or cluster headaches you have. It is not known if sumatriptan is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. Do not take sumatriptan injection if you have: heart problems or a history of heart problems narrowing of blood vessels to your legs, arms, stomach, or kidneys (peripheral vascular disease) uncontrolled high blood pressure severe liver problems hemiplegic migraines or basilar migraines. If you are not sure if you have these types of migraines, ask your healthcare provider. had a stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or problems with your blood circulation taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: almotriptan (AXERT) frovatriptan (FROVA) rizatriptan (MAXALT, MAXALT-MLT) sumatriptan and naproxen (TREXIMET) ergotamines (CAFERGOT, ERGOMAR, MIGERGOT) eletriptan (RELPAX) naratriptan (AMERGE) sumatriptan and naproxen (TREXIMET) dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45, MIGRANAL) Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is listed above. an allergy to sumatriptan or any of the ingredients in sumatriptan injection.

( 5.4 ) Cerebrovascular Events: Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Other Vasospasm Reactions: Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if non-coronary vasospastic reaction occurs. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.7 ) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.8 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.9 ) Medication Overuse Headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.10 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if occurs. ( 5.11 ) Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. ( 5.12 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.13 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets at first sign of rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.14 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue and evaluate clinically. ( 5.15 ) Fetal Toxicity: Limit use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets between about 20 to 30 weeks in pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction. Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy due to the risks of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 5.16 , 8.1 ) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.17 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma (without aspirin sensitivity). ( 5.18 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events The use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) and in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to increased risk of serious cardiovascular events with sumatriptan and NSAIDS [see Contraindications (4) ] . Cardiovascular Events with Sumatriptan There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events with Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10\u201314 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4) ]. Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of cardiovascular events, even in the absence of previous cardiovascular symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and/or symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including naproxen, a component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only 1 in 5 patients who develop a serious upper gastrointestinal adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs appear to occur in approximately 1% of patients treated daily for 3 to 6 months and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for 1 year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. Among 3,302 adult patients with migraine who received Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 1 patient experienced a recurrence of gastric ulcer after taking 8 doses over 3 weeks, and 1 patient developed a gastric ulcer after treating an average of 8 attacks per month over 7 months. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding compared with patients with neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal gastrointestinal events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients, and therefore special care should be taken in treating this population. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For high risk patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.4 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.5 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Borderline elevations of 1 or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients who take NSAIDs including naproxen, a component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Hepatic abnormalities may be the result of hypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. These abnormalities may progress, may remain essentially unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy. Notable (3 times the upper limit of normal) elevations of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal cases of severe hepatic injury, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported with NSAIDs. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flulike\" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. 5.8 Hypertension Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including sumatriptan, a component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. This occurrence has included patients without a history of hypertension. NSAIDs, including naproxen, a component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, can also lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.9 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Since each Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg tablet contains approximately 60 mg of sodium and each Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 10/60 mg tablet contains approximately 20 mg of sodium, this should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted. 5.10 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.11 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.12 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, salt depletion, those taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with renal disease develop or if systemic manifestations occur. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] <30 mL/min) unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Monitor renal function in patients with mild (CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CrCl = 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, preexisting kidney disease, or dehydration. The renal effects of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Avoid the use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with the use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.13 Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to either component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens although anaphylactic reactions with naproxen have occurred in patient without known hypersensitivity to naproxen or to patients with aspirin sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] . Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in patients with asthma who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan, naproxen, or any other component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.18) ] . Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.14 Serious Skin Reactions NSAID-containing products can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions and to discontinue the use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.15 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.16 Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.17 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross gastrointestinal blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.18 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma [see Contraindications (4) ] . When Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 5.19 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. 5.20 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.21 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.7 , 5.12) ] ."

Adults The adverse reactions reported below are specific to the clinical trials with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg. See also the full prescribing information for naproxen and sumatriptan products. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials (Study 1 and 2) in adult patients who received 1 dose of study drug. Only adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age In a placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age who received 1 dose of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 10/60 mg, 30/180 mg, or 85/500 mg, adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients who received 10/60 mg, 9% of patients who received 30/180 mg, 13% who received 85/500 mg, and 8% who received placebo. No patients who received Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets experienced adverse reactions leading to withdrawal from the trial. The incidence of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was comparable across all 3 doses compared with placebo. Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in a placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age at a frequency of 2% or more with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and were more frequent than the placebo group.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended. ( 7.1 ) ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function. ( 7.1 ) Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of loop and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects. ( 7.1 ) Digoxin: Concomitant use with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels. ( 7.1 ) Lithium: Increases lithium plasma levels. ( 7.1 ) Methotrexate: Increases methotrexate plasma levels. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions with NSAIDs or Sumatriptan. Table 3. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Naproxen or Sumatriptan Ergot-Containing Drugs Clinical Impact: Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Intervention: Because these effects may be additive, coadministration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors Clinical Impact: MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure of orally administered sumatriptan by 7-fold. Intervention: The use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated. Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Clinical Impact: 5-HT 1 agonist drugs can cause vasospastic effects. Intervention: Because these effects may be additive, coadministration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and other 5 HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Naproxen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of naproxen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . Aspirin Clinical Impact: A pharmacodynamic (PD) study has demonstrated an interaction in which lower dose naproxen (220mg/day or 220mg twice daily) interfered with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose immediate-release aspirin, with the interaction most marked during the washout period of naproxen [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . There is reason to expect that the interaction would be present with prescription doses of naproxen or with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin; however, the peak interference with aspirin function may be later than observed in the PD study due to the longer washout period. Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events following discontinuation of naproxen due to the interference with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin during the washout period, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection who require intermittent analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics where appropriate. Concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17) ] . Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Clinical Impact: Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Intervention: Discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-blockers Clinical Impact: NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8 , 5.12) ] . Digoxin Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of naproxen with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels. Lithium Clinical Impact: NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance . The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high-dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels, resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity. Cyclosporine Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity. Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. NSAIDs and Salicylates Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Intervention: The concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Pemetrexed Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information). Intervention: During concomitant use of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration. Probenecid Clinical Impact: Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Intervention: Reduce the frequency of administration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets when given concurrently with probenecid. 7.2 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Blood Tests Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined. Urine Tests The administration of naproxen sodium may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay. Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be artificially altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used. Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Infertility: NSAIDs are associated with reversible infertility. Consider withdrawal of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in women who have difficulties conceiving ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations , Data ). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Human Data ). In animal studies, administration of sumatriptan and naproxen, alone or in combination, during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (increased incidences of fetal malformations, embryofetal and pup mortality, decreased embryofetal growth) at clinically relevant doses ( see Animal Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as naproxen sodium resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus ( see Data ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and follow up according to clinical practice ( see Data ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of naproxen tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including naproxen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Data Human Data There is some evidence to suggest that when inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis are used to delay preterm labor, there is an increased risk of neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and intracranial hemorrhage. Naproxen treatment given in late pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm infants. The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry included only 6 pregnancy exposures to Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, with no major birth defects reported. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or to support making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Animal Data Oral administration of sumatriptan alone to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 170 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan alone to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan combined with naproxen sodium (5/9, 25/45, or 50/90 mg/kg/day sumatriptan/naproxen sodium) or each drug alone (50/0, 0/90 mg/kg/day sumatriptan/naproxen sodium) to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased total incidences of fetal abnormalities at all doses and increased incidences of specific malformations (cardiac interventricular septal defect in the 50/90 mg/kg/day group, fused caudal vertebrae in the 50/0 and 0/90 mg/kg/day groups) and variations (absent intermediate lobe of the lung, irregular ossification of the skull, incompletely ossified sternal centra) at the highest dose of sumatriptan and naproxen alone and in combination. A no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in rabbit was not established. The lowest effect dose of 5/9 mg/kg/day sumatriptan/naproxen sodium was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to sumatriptan and naproxen that were less than those attained at the MRHD of 170 mg sumatriptan and 1000 mg naproxen sodium (two tablets of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg in a 24-hour period). Oral administration of sumatriptan alone to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 6 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In reproduction studies of naproxen in rats (20 mg/kg/day), rabbits (20 mg/kg/day, and mice (170 mg/kg/day, no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus was observed. The doses tested in rats, rabbits, and mice were less (\u22640.8 times) the MRHD, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) comparisons. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma. Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration ( see Data ). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of naproxen or sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of naproxen or sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Females Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in pediatric patients under 12 years of age have not been established. The safety and efficacy of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets for the acute treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is not recommended for use in elderly patients who have decreased renal function, higher risk for unrecognized CAD, and increases in blood pressure that may be more pronounced in the elderly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.8 , 5.12) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. Monitor the serum creatinine or creatinine clearance in patients with mild (CrCl = 60 to 89 mL/min) or moderate (CrCL = 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment, preexisting kidney disease, or dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. For patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets dose should be reduced. [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations , Data ). Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Human Data ). In animal studies, administration of sumatriptan and naproxen, alone or in combination, during pregnancy resulted in developmental toxicity (increased incidences of fetal malformations, embryofetal and pup mortality, decreased embryofetal growth) at clinically relevant doses ( see Animal Data ). Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as naproxen sodium resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus ( see Data ). Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and follow up according to clinical practice ( see Data ). Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of naproxen tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including naproxen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. Data Human Data There is some evidence to suggest that when inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis are used to delay preterm labor, there is an increased risk of neonatal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis, patent ductus arteriosus, and intracranial hemorrhage. Naproxen treatment given in late pregnancy to delay parturition has been associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension, renal dysfunction, and abnormal prostaglandin E levels in preterm infants. The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry included only 6 pregnancy exposures to Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, with no major birth defects reported. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or to support making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group.

Volunteers (N = 174) have received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse events. Overdose of sumatriptan in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred, but were rare [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] . Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan. Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets contains sumatriptan and naproxen. Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to cloned 5-HT 1B / 1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of neuropeptide release. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B 2 inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)]. The interaction was observed even following discontinuation of naproxen on day 11 (while aspirin dose was continued) but normalized by day 13. In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%]. Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate\u2013release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Blood Pressure In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active control trial, Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg administered intermittently over 6 months did not increase blood pressure in a normotensive adult population (n = 122). However, significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported with 5-HT 1 agonists and NSAIDs in patients with and without a history of hypertension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability Sumatriptan, when given as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg, has a mean C max similar to that of sumatriptan succinate 100 mg tablets alone. The median T max of sumatriptan, when given as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg, was 1 hour (range: 0.3 to 4.0 hours), which is slightly different compared with sumatriptan succinate 100 mg tablets (median T max of 1.5 hours). Naproxen, when given as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg, has a C max which is approximately 36% lower than naproxen sodium 550 mg tablets and a median T max of 5 hours (range: 0.3 to 12 hours), which is approximately 4 hours later than from naproxen sodium tablets 550 mg. AUC values for sumatriptan and for naproxen are similar for Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg compared with sumatriptan succinate 100 mg tablets or naproxen sodium 550 mg tablets, respectively. In a crossover trial in 16 subjects, the pharmacokinetics of both components administered as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg were similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period. Bioavailability of sumatriptan is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic (first-pass) metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. Naproxen is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%. Food had no significant effect on the bioavailability of sumatriptan or naproxen administered as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, but slightly delayed the T max of sumatriptan by about 0.6 hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Distribution Plasma protein binding is 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The volume of distribution of sumatriptan is 2.7 L/kg. The volume of distribution of naproxen is 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day, there is a less-than-proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough C ss = 36.5, 49.2, and 56.4 mg/L with 500-; 1,000-; and 1,500-mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively). However, the concentration of unbound naproxen continues to increase proportionally to dose. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor. Naproxen is extensively metabolized to 6-0-desmethyl naproxen, and both parent and metabolites do not induce metabolizing enzymes. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%), with about 40% found in the feces. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Three percent of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan . The clearance of naproxen is 0.13 mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (less than 1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (less than 1%), or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans is approximately 19 hours. The corresponding half-lives of both metabolites and conjugates of naproxen are shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide closely with the rate of naproxen disappearance from the plasma. In patients with renal failure, metabolites may accumulate. Specific Populations Geriatrics The pharmacokinetics of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in geriatric patients have not been studied. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function and decreased renal function [see Specific Populations (8.5) ] . The pharmacokinetics of oral sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in patients with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction, which represents <1% of the total concentration, increased in the elderly (range of unbound trough naproxen from 0.12% to 0.19% in elderly subjects versus 0.05% to 0.075% in younger subjects). Pediatrics A pharmacokinetic study compared 3 doses of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age (n=24) with adults (n=26). The AUC and C max of sumatriptan were 50-60% higher following a single dose of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 10/60 mg in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age (n=7) compared with adult subjects (n=8), and were 6-26% higher following a single dose of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 30/180 mg or 85/500 mg in pediatrics than adults. Naproxen pharmacokinetic parameters were similar between pediatrics and adults. Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has not been studied. Since naproxen and its metabolites and conjugates are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal insufficiency. Elimination of naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has not been studied. In a study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), patients with hepatic impairment had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max of sumatriptan and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared to healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. Gender In a pooled analysis of 5 pharmacokinetic trials, there was no effect of gender on the systemic exposure of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets. Race The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has not been studied. The systemic clearance and C max of sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and white (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Aspirin When naproxen was administered with aspirin (>1 gram/day), the protein binding of naproxen was reduced, although the clearance of free naproxen was not altered. See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions of naproxen, an NSAID, with aspirin [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Propranolol Propranolol 80 mg given twice daily had no significant effect on sumatriptan pharmacokinetics. See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions of propranolol, a beta-blocker, with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets contains sumatriptan and naproxen. Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to cloned 5-HT 1B / 1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of neuropeptide release. Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. The mechanism of action of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro . Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B 2 inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)]. The interaction was observed even following discontinuation of naproxen on day 11 (while aspirin dose was continued) but normalized by day 13. In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%]. Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate\u2013release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Blood Pressure In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, active control trial, Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg administered intermittently over 6 months did not increase blood pressure in a normotensive adult population (n = 122). However, significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported with 5-HT 1 agonists and NSAIDs in patients with and without a history of hypertension."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability Sumatriptan, when given as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg, has a mean C max similar to that of sumatriptan succinate 100 mg tablets alone. The median T max of sumatriptan, when given as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg, was 1 hour (range: 0.3 to 4.0 hours), which is slightly different compared with sumatriptan succinate 100 mg tablets (median T max of 1.5 hours). Naproxen, when given as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg, has a C max which is approximately 36% lower than naproxen sodium 550 mg tablets and a median T max of 5 hours (range: 0.3 to 12 hours), which is approximately 4 hours later than from naproxen sodium tablets 550 mg. AUC values for sumatriptan and for naproxen are similar for Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg compared with sumatriptan succinate 100 mg tablets or naproxen sodium 550 mg tablets, respectively. In a crossover trial in 16 subjects, the pharmacokinetics of both components administered as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg were similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period. Bioavailability of sumatriptan is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic (first-pass) metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. Naproxen is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with an in vivo bioavailability of 95%. Food had no significant effect on the bioavailability of sumatriptan or naproxen administered as Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets, but slightly delayed the T max of sumatriptan by about 0.6 hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Distribution Plasma protein binding is 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The volume of distribution of sumatriptan is 2.7 L/kg. The volume of distribution of naproxen is 0.16 L/kg. At therapeutic levels naproxen is greater than 99% albumin bound. At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day, there is a less-than-proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough C ss = 36.5, 49.2, and 56.4 mg/L with 500-; 1,000-; and 1,500-mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively). However, the concentration of unbound naproxen continues to increase proportionally to dose. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor. Naproxen is extensively metabolized to 6-0-desmethyl naproxen, and both parent and metabolites do not induce metabolizing enzymes. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%), with about 40% found in the feces. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Three percent of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan . The clearance of naproxen is 0.13 mL/min/kg. Approximately 95% of the naproxen from any dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as naproxen (less than 1%), 6-0-desmethyl naproxen (less than 1%), or their conjugates (66% to 92%). The plasma half-life of the naproxen anion in humans is approximately 19 hours. The corresponding half-lives of both metabolites and conjugates of naproxen are shorter than 12 hours, and their rates of excretion have been found to coincide closely with the rate of naproxen disappearance from the plasma.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis The carcinogenic potential of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets has not been studied. In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. The highest doses tested are approximately 5 (mouse) and 9 (rat) times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 170 mg sumatriptan on a mg/m 2 basis (two tablets of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg in a 24-hour period). The carcinogenic potential of naproxen was evaluated in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats at doses of 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg/day and in another 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day. No evidence of tumorigenicity was found in either study. The highest dose tested is less than the MHDD (1000 mg) of naproxen, on a mg/m 2 basis. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan and naproxen sodium tested alone and in combination were negative in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, and in an in vivo micronucleus assay in mice. The combination of sumatriptan and naproxen sodium was negative in an in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assay in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. However, in separate in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assays, naproxen sodium alone was reproducibly positive in the presence of metabolic activation. Naproxen sodium alone and in combination with sumatriptan was positive in an in vitro clastogenicity assay in mammalian cells in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. The clastogenic effect for the combination was reproducible within this assay and was greater than observed with naproxen sodium alone. Sumatriptan alone was negative in these assays. Chromosomal aberrations were not induced in peripheral blood lymphocytes following 7 days of twice-daily dosing with Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in human volunteers. In previous studies, sumatriptan alone was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility The effect of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets on fertility in animals has not been studied. When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a drug-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MHDD of 170 mg on a mg/m 2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dosage tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. The lowest dose tested is less than the MHDD (170 mg) of sumatriptan on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adults The efficacy of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group trials utilizing placebo and each individual active component of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) as comparison treatments (Study 1 and Study 2). Patients enrolled in these 2 trials were predominately female (87%) and white (88%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a migraine of moderate to severe pain with 1 tablet. No rescue medication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. Patients evaluated their headache pain 2 hours after taking 1 dose of study medication; headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain. Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also evaluated. Sustained pain free was defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to no pain at 2 hours postdose without a return of mild, moderate, or severe pain and no use of rescue medication for 24 hours postdose. The results from Study 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 4. In both trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache pain relief 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg (65% and 57%) compared with those who received placebo (28% and 29%). Further, the percentage of patients who remained pain free without use of other medications through 24 hours postdose was significantly greater among patients receiving a single dose of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg (25% and 23%) compared with those who received placebo (8% and 7%) or either sumatriptan (16% and 14%) or naproxen sodium (10%) alone.

Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 85/500 mg was more effective than placebo regardless of the presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; or concomitant use of oral contraceptives or common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, anti-epileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants). Figure 1 Figure 2 14.2 Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The efficacy of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial comparing 3 doses of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets and placebo (Study 3). Patients enrolled in this trial were mostly female (59%) and white (81%), with a mean age of 15 years. Patients were required to have at least a 6-month history of migraine attacks with or without aura usually lasting 3 hours or more when untreated. Following a single-blind, placebo run-in phase, placebo nonresponders were randomized to receive a single dose of either Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets 10/60 mg, 30/180 mg, 85/500 mg, or placebo. Patients were instructed to treat a single migraine attack with headache pain of moderate to severe intensity. No rescue medication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. Patients evaluated their headache pain 2 hours after taking 1 dose of study medication. Two-hour pain free was defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to no pain at 2 hours postdose. Results are summarized in Table 5. The percentage of patients who were pain free at 2 hours postdose was significantly greater among patients who received any of the 3 doses of Sumatriptan and Naproxen Sodium Tablets compared with placebo.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT 1D family) having only a weak affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 5A , and 5-HT 7 receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5-HT 2 , 5-HT 3 , or 5-HT 4 receptor subtypes or at alpha 1- , alpha 2- , or beta-adrenergic; dopamine 1 ; dopamine 2 ; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. The vascular 5-HT 1 receptor subtype that sumatriptan activates is present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of human dura mater and mediates vasoconstriction. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5-HT 1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans. In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues. Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Special Populations Renal Impairment Renal Impairment:The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined, but little clinical effect would be expected as sumatriptan is largely metabolized to an inactive substance. Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In 1 small study of hepatically impaired patients (N = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects, the hepatically impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a t max 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Age The pharmacokinetics of oral sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age, 72 years; 2 males and 4 females) and in patients with migraine (mean age, 38 years; 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age, 30 years) (see PRECAUTIONS : Geriatric Use ). Gender In a study comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , t max , and half-life. Race The systemic clearance and C max of sumatriptan were similar in black (N = 34) and Caucasian (N = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

      "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

      "CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptane tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 studies, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 or 100 mg group when compared to the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 and 100 mg dose groups in any study. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 1. Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.

Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Study 1) and at 4 hours (Studies 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared to placebo. As early as 2 hours in Studies 2 and 3 or 4 hours in Study 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2.

Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the patient; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. fig1 fig2"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Sumatriptan tablets are not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache, which is present in an older, predominantly male population."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Sumatriptan tablets should not be given to patients with history, symptoms, or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes. In addition, patients with other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases should not receive sumatriptane tablets. Ischemic cardiac syndromes include, but are not limited to, angina pectoris of any type (e.g., stable angina of effort, vasospastic forms of angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischemia. Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to, strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease (see WARNINGS ). Because sumatriptan tablets may increase blood pressure, they should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Concurrent administration of MAO-A inhibitors or use within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Sumatriptan tablets should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine. Sumatriptan tablets and any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) should not be used within 24 hours of each other, nor should sumatriptan and another 5-HT 1 agonist. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any of their components. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient\u2019s medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician\u2019s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan. The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan. Drug-Associated Cardiac Events and Fatalities Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. Considering the extent of use of sumatriptan in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. The fact that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In many cases, however, where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Premarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Of 6,348 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of oral sumatriptan, 2 experienced clinical adverse events shortly after receiving oral sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary vasospasm. Neither of these adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome. Among the more than 1,900 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan, there were 8 patients who sustained clinical events during or shortly after receiving sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary artery vasospasm. Six of these 8 patients had ECG changes consistent with transient ischemia, but without accompanying clinical symptoms or signs. Of these 8 patients, 4 had either findings suggestive of CAD or risk factors predictive of CAD prior to study enrollment. Among approximately 4,000 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of sumatriptan nasal spray, 1 patient experienced an asymptomatic subendocardial infarction possibly subsequent to a coronary vasospastic event. Postmarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association with the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of sumatriptan and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of sumatriptan. Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include: coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death. Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery vasospasm. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). Other Vasospasm-Related Events Sumatriptan may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Both peripheral vascular ischemia and colonic ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea have been reported. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of sumatriptan. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Sumatriptan, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Serotonin synd rome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g ., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperr eflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The on set of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Treatment with Sumatriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) . Sumatriptan should be administered with caution to patients with controlled hypertension as transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance have been observed in a small proportion of patients. Concomitant Drug Use In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Accordingly, the coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and an MAO-A inhibitor is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid) reactions have occurred on rare occasions in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS ). Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS ). For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose. Overuse: Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use. Information for Patients See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs. Laboratory Tests No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to and/or after treatment with sumatriptan. Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life\u2011threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS ). Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Sumatriptan tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage (rats: 104 weeks) or drinking water (mice: 78 weeks). Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Completed placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in theses patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Post-marketing experience includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced adverse events, some clinically serious, after use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and/or oral sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. A myocardial infarct has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended. Geriatric Use The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS )."

Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis.

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ) . Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan succinate injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hepatic disease/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT 1D family) having only a weak affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 5A , and 5-HT 7 receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5-HT 2 , 5-HT 3 , or 5-HT 4 receptor subtypes or at alpha 1- , alpha 2- , or beta-adrenergic; dopamine 1 ; dopamine 2 ; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. The vascular 5-HT 1 receptor subtype that sumatriptan activates is present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of human dura mater and mediates vasoconstriction. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5-HT 1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans. In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues. Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Special Populations Renal Impairment Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined, but little clinical effect would be expected as sumatriptan is largely metabolized to an inactive substance. Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In 1 small study of hepatically impaired patients (N = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects, the hepatically impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a t max 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Age The pharmacokinetics of oral sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age, 72 years; 2 males and 4 females) and in patients with migraine (mean age, 38 years; 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age, 30 years) (see PRECAUTIONS : Geriatric Use ). Gender In a study comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , t max , and half-life. Race The systemic clearance and C max of sumatriptan were similar in black (N = 34) and Caucasian (N = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."
    ],
    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",
      "Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life\u2011threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS ). Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptane tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 studies, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 or 100 mg group when compared to the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 and 100 mg dose groups in any study. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 1. Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment is depicted in Figure 1. a The figure shows the probability over time of obtaining headache response (no or mild pain) following treatment with sumatriptan. The averages displayed are based on pooled data from the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy. Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Study 1) and at 4 hours (Studies 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared to placebo. As early as 2 hours in Studies 2 and 3 or 4 hours in Study 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the patient; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. fig1 fig2"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Sumatriptan tablets are not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache, which is present in an older, predominantly male population."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Sumatriptan tablets should not be given to patients with history, symptoms, or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes. In addition, patients with other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases should not receive sumatriptane tablets. Ischemic cardiac syndromes include, but are not limited to, angina pectoris of any type (e.g., stable angina of effort, vasospastic forms of angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischemia. Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to, strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease (see WARNINGS ). Because sumatriptan tablets may increase blood pressure, they should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Concurrent administration of MAO-A inhibitors or use within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Sumatriptan tablets should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine. Sumatriptan tablets and any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) should not be used within 24 hours of each other, nor should sumatriptan and another 5-HT 1 agonist. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any of their components. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient\u2019s medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician\u2019s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan. The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan. Drug-Associated Cardiac Events and Fatalities Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. Considering the extent of use of sumatriptan in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. The fact that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In many cases, however, where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Premarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Of 6,348 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of oral sumatriptan, 2 experienced clinical adverse events shortly after receiving oral sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary vasospasm. Neither of these adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome. Among the more than 1,900 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan, there were 8 patients who sustained clinical events during or shortly after receiving sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary artery vasospasm. Six of these 8 patients had ECG changes consistent with transient ischemia, but without accompanying clinical symptoms or signs. Of these 8 patients, 4 had either findings suggestive of CAD or risk factors predictive of CAD prior to study enrollment. Among approximately 4,000 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of sumatriptan nasal spray, 1 patient experienced an asymptomatic subendocardial infarction possibly subsequent to a coronary vasospastic event. Postmarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association with the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of sumatriptan and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of sumatriptan. Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include: coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death. Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery vasospasm. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). Other Vasospasm-Related Events Sumatriptan may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Both peripheral vascular ischemia and colonic ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea have been reported. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of sumatriptan. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Sumatriptan, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Serotonin synd rome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g ., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperr eflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The on set of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Treatment with Sumatriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) . Sumatriptan should be administered with caution to patients with controlled hypertension as transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance have been observed in a small proportion of patients. Concomitant Drug Use In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Accordingly, the coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and an MAO-A inhibitor is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid) reactions have occurred on rare occasions in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS ). Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS ). For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose. Overuse: Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use. Information for Patients See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs. Laboratory Tests No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to and/or after treatment with sumatriptan. Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life\u2011threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS ). Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Sumatriptan tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage (rats: 104 weeks) or drinking water (mice: 78 weeks). Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Completed placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in theses patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Post-marketing experience includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced adverse events, some clinically serious, after use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and/or oral sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. A myocardial infarct has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended. Geriatric Use The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS )."

In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day.

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ) . Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan succinate injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hepatic disease/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT 1D family) having only a weak affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 5A , and 5-HT 7 receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5-HT 2 , 5-HT 3 , or 5-HT 4 receptor subtypes or at alpha 1- , alpha 2- , or beta-adrenergic; dopamine 1 ; dopamine 2 ; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. The vascular 5-HT 1 receptor subtype that sumatriptan activates is present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of human dura mater and mediates vasoconstriction. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5-HT 1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans. In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues. Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Special Populations Renal Impairment Renal Impairment:The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined, but little clinical effect would be expected as sumatriptan is largely metabolized to an inactive substance. Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In 1 small study of hepatically impaired patients (N = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects, the hepatically impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a t max 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Age The pharmacokinetics of oral sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age, 72 years; 2 males and 4 females) and in patients with migraine (mean age, 38 years; 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age, 30 years) (see PRECAUTIONS : Geriatric Use ). Gender In a study comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , t max , and half-life. Race The systemic clearance and C max of sumatriptan were similar in black (N = 34) and Caucasian (N = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptane tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 studies, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 or 100 mg group when compared to the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 and 100 mg dose groups in any study. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 1. Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.

Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response Within 240 Minutesa a The figure shows the probability over time of obtaining headache response (no or mild pain) following treatment with sumatriptan. The averages displayed are based on pooled data from the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy. Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Study 1) and at 4 hours (Studies 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared to placebo. As early as 2 hours in Studies 2 and 3 or 4 hours in Study 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraine Over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatmenta a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the patient; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. fig1 fig2"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Sumatriptan tablets are not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache, which is present in an older, predominantly male population."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Sumatriptan tablets should not be given to patients with history, symptoms, or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes. In addition, patients with other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases should not receive sumatriptane tablets. Ischemic cardiac syndromes include, but are not limited to, angina pectoris of any type (e.g., stable angina of effort, vasospastic forms of angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischemia. Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to, strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease (see WARNINGS ). Because sumatriptan tablets may increase blood pressure, they should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Concurrent administration of MAO-A inhibitors or use within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Sumatriptan tablets should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine. Sumatriptan tablets and any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) should not be used within 24 hours of each other, nor should sumatriptan and another 5-HT 1 agonist. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any of their components. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient\u2019s medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician\u2019s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan. The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan. Drug-Associated Cardiac Events and Fatalities Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. Considering the extent of use of sumatriptan in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. The fact that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In many cases, however, where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Premarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Of 6,348 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of oral sumatriptan, 2 experienced clinical adverse events shortly after receiving oral sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary vasospasm. Neither of these adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome. Among the more than 1,900 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan, there were 8 patients who sustained clinical events during or shortly after receiving sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary artery vasospasm. Six of these 8 patients had ECG changes consistent with transient ischemia, but without accompanying clinical symptoms or signs. Of these 8 patients, 4 had either findings suggestive of CAD or risk factors predictive of CAD prior to study enrollment. Among approximately 4,000 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of sumatriptan nasal spray, 1 patient experienced an asymptomatic subendocardial infarction possibly subsequent to a coronary vasospastic event. Postmarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association with the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of sumatriptan and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of sumatriptan. Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include: coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death. Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery vasospasm. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). Other Vasospasm-Related Events Sumatriptan may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Both peripheral vascular ischemia and colonic ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea have been reported. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of sumatriptan. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Sumatriptan, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Serotonin synd rome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g ., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperr eflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The on set of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Treatment with Sumatriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) . Sumatriptan should be administered with caution to patients with controlled hypertension as transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance have been observed in a small proportion of patients. Concomitant Drug Use In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Accordingly, the coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and an MAO-A inhibitor is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid) reactions have occurred on rare occasions in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS ). Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS ). For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose. Overuse: Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use. Information for Patients See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs. Laboratory Tests No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to and/or after treatment with sumatriptan. Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life\u2011threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS ). Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Sumatriptan tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage (rats: 104 weeks) or drinking water (mice: 78 weeks). Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Completed placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in theses patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Post-marketing experience includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced adverse events, some clinically serious, after use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and/or oral sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. A myocardial infarct has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended. Geriatric Use The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS )."

The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration.",
      "Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity.",
      "Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Completed placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in theses patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Post-marketing experience includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced adverse events, some clinically serious, after use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and/or oral sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. A myocardial infarct has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ) . Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan succinate injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hepatic disease/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation)."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only. (2.1) Acute treatment of migraine: single dose of 4 to 6 mg (2.1) Acute treatment of cluster headache: single dose of 6 mg (2.1) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 12 mg, separate doses by at least 1 hour. (2.1) 2.1 Dosing Information The maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, the lower dose of 4 mg may be used [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of lower doses has not been established. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 mg injections separated by at least 1 hour. A second 6 mg dose should only be considered if some response to a first injection was observed. 2.2 Administration Using the Sumatriptan Autoinjector An autoinjector device (sumatriptan autoinjector) is available for use with 6 mg prefilled syringe to facilitate self-administration in patients using the 6 mg dose. With this device, the needle penetrates approximately 1/4 inch (5 to 6 mm). The injection is intended to be given subcutaneously, and intramuscular or intravascular delivery must be avoided. Instruct patients on the proper use of the sumatriptan autoinjector and direct them to use injection sites with an adequate skin and subcutaneous thickness to accommodate the length of the needle."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. (5.1) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.2) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. (5.3) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.4) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.5) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. (5.6) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. (5.7) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. (5.10) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck and /or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional injections of sumatriptan. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g. hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Chest, throat, neck, and/or jaw pain/tightness/pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Cerebrovascular events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Other vasospasm reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Medication overuse headache [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Increase in blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and > placebo) were injection site reactions, tingling, dizziness/vertigo, warm/hot sensation, burning sensation, feeling of heaviness, pressure sensation, flushing, feeling of tightness, and numbness (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Inc., at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraines (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine (Studies 2 and 3) \u00ad Percent of Subjects Reporting Adverse Reaction Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Subcutaneous (n = 547) % Placebo (n = 370) % Atypical sensations 42 9 Tingling 14 3 Warm/hot sensation 11 4 Burning sensation 7 <1 Feeling of heaviness 7 1 Pressure sensation 7 2 Feeling of tightness 5 <1 Numbness 5 2 Feeling strange 2 <1 Tight feeling in head 2 <1 Cardiovascular \u00ad \u00ad Flushing 7 2 Chest discomfort 5 1 Tightness in chest 3 <1 Pressure in chest 2 <1 Ear, nose, and throat \u00ad \u00ad Throat discomfort 3 <1 Discomfort: nasal cavity/sinuses 2 <1 Injection site reaction a 59 24 Miscellaneous \u00ad \u00ad Jaw discomfort 2 0 Musculoskeletal \u00ad \u00ad Weakness 5 <1 Neck pain/stiffness 5 <1 Myalgia 2 <1 Neurological \u00ad \u00ad Dizziness/vertigo 12 4 Drowsiness/sedation 3 2 Headache 2 <1 Skin \u00ad \u00ad Sweating 2 1 a Includes injection site pain, stinging/burning, swelling, erythema, bruising, bleeding. The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6 mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b115 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15\u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age :The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose-tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60 week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 3 times the human exposure after a 6 mg subcutaneous dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1,000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3, onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6 mg sumatriptan injection. Lower doses of sumatriptan injection may also prove effective, although the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses. In Study 1, 6 different doses of sumatriptan injection (n = 30 each group) were compared with placebo (n = 62), in a single-attack, parallel-group design, the dose-response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Proportion of Patients with Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Reactions by Time and by Sumatriptan Dose in Study 1 Percent Patients with Relief a Dose of Sumatriptan Injection at 10 Minutes at 30 Minutes at 1 Hour at 2 Hours Adverse Reactions Incidence (%) Placebo 5 15 24 21 55 1 mg 10 40 43 40 63 2 mg 7 23 57 43 63 3 mg 17 47 57 60 77 4 mg 13 37 50 57 80 6 mg 10 63 73 70 83 8 mg 23 57 80 83 93 a Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication. In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of sumatriptan injection 6 mg in 1,104 patients with moderate or severe migraine pain (Studies 2 and 3), the onset of relief was less than 10 minutes. Headache relief, as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in 70% of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan injection. Approximately 82% and 65% of patients treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours, respectively. Table 3 shows the 1- and 2-hour efficacy results for sumatriptan injection 6 mg in Studies 2 and 3. Table 3.

Sumatriptan injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. Similar efficacy was seen when patients self-administered sumatriptan injection using the sumatriptan autoinjector. The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 Study 4 Study 5 Placebo (n = 39) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 39) Placebo (n = 88) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 92) Patients with pain relief (no/mild) 5 Minutes post-injection 8% 21% 7% 23% a 10 Minutes post-injection 10% 49% a 25% 49% a 15 Minutes post-injection 26% 74% a 35% 75% a a P<0.05. n = Number of headaches treated An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours)."

You and your healthcare provider should talk about sumatriptan injection when you start taking it and at regular checkups. Use the device immediately once the cap has been removed; it is advised not to postpone the injection. Keep the Sumatriptan Autoinjector System out of the reach of children. INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF AUTOINJECTOR PEN Important things that you need to know This device is called an Autoinjector pen. Here we use the shorter name \u2018pen\u2019. 1.Read all of the instructions carefully before using this pen. 2. Follow these step-by-step instructions every time you use the pen, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 3. Only use each pen once - do not try to use more than once. If you have any further questions, A.

GETTING READY Getting ready for the injection 1.Wash your hands. 2.Choose an area with an adequate fatty tissue layer. 3.Clean the skin area to be injected with alcohol or a new sterile swab (see Figure A). Getting the pen ready 4. Take the pen out of the package. 5. Look in the transparent medicine window on the pen. Before injection, to check that the liquid is clear (see Figure B). If it is difficult to see what is in the window, hold the pen upto the light and check. After injection, the blue plunger rod completely fills the medicine window (see Figure C). If the blue plunger rod can be seen through the medicine window, the device is spent and cannot be used again. 6. Pull the gray cap off thepen. Do not twist the cap. Pull it straight off (see Figure D) 7. Look inside the cap, check that the gray needle cover is inside (see Figure E).Do not use the pen if the gray needle cover is not inside the cap. 8. Do not try to put the cap back. If you try to put it back, this will damage the needle. You are now ready to inject the medicine, go to step 9. C. INJECTING THE MEDICINE 9. Without pressing the blue button, push the pen firmly against your skin until you feel the stop point (see FigureF). \u2022 Pushing to the stop point unlocks the button . \u2022 As long as the pen is firmly pressed against the skin, the safety lock is de- activated; the pen could fire unintentionally if the blue button is pressed by acciden t. \u2022 Do not attempt to re- engage the safety lock at any time \u2022 Keep the pen pressed against your skin for the next steps. 1 0 Keep pushing the pen against your skin then firmly press down the blue button on the top of the pen until it will not go further (see Figure G). \u2022You will hear a click, this indicates that the injection has started (see Figure G). \u2022 If the injection did not start, release the blue button, make sure the pen is pushed down against the skin and push down harder on the blue button. 11. Do not take the pen off your skin. Monitor the injection through the medicine window to make sure that the entire dose is injected. The blue plunger will move down the window, completely fill it, and stop moving when the injection is done (see Figure H). When the injection is done, keep holding the pen against the skin for 5 seconds (see Figure I). If you take the pen off before, not all of the medicine will be injected. 12. Carefully take the pen off your skin (see Figure J). \u2022 The protective sleeve automatically covers the needle. It is then locked and the needle is protected. D. WHAT TO DO AFTER THE INJECTION 13.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet. ( 2.1 ) A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan succinate tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan succinate tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan succinate tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan succinate tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan succinate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan succinate tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Sumatriptan succinate tablets contain sumatriptan succinate, a selective 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist. Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-indole-5-methanesulfonamide succinate (1:1), and it has the following structure: The molecular formula is C 14 H 21 N 3 O 2 S\u00b7C 4 H 6 O 4, representing a molecular weight of 413.5. Sumatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline. Each sumatriptan succinate tablet for oral administration contains 35 mg, 70 mg, or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate, USP equivalent to 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg of sumatriptan, respectively. Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, D&C Red # 27 aluminum lake (100 mg only), dibasic calcium phosphate, hypromellose, iron oxide red (100 mg only), magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol (25 mg & 50 mg only), polysorbate 80 (25 mg & 50 mg only) propylene glycol (100 mg only), talc and titanium dioxide. chemical-structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1 B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1 B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol : Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Mild or No Headache) 2 and 4 Hours following Treatment Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets 25 mg 2 h 4 h Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets 50 mg 2 h 4 h Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets 100 mg 2 h 4 h Placebo 2 h 4 h Trial 1 52% a 67% a (n = 298) 61% a , b 78% a , b (n = 296) 62% a , b 79% a , b (n = 296) 27% 38% (n = 94) Trial 2 52% a 70% a (n = 66) 50% a 68% a (n = 62) 56% a 71% a (n = 66) 26% 38% (n = 65) Trial 3 52% a 65% a (n = 48) 54% a 72% a (n = 46) 57% a 78% a (n = 46) 17% 19% (n = 47) a P<0.05 in comparison with placebo. b P<0.05 in comparison with 25 mg. The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment in pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 is depicted in Figure 1. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. Sumatriptan-figure-1 Sumatriptan-figure-2"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information). Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction, Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina, Other Vasospasm-Related Events, Arrhythmias, and Cerebrovascular Events Inform patients that sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause serious cardiovascular side effects such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Although serious cardiovascular events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, significant rise in blood pressure, weakness, and slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice if any indicative sign or symptoms are observed. Apprise patients of the importance of this follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 )] . Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Inform patients that anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sumatriptan succinate tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use: Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with sumatriptan succinate tablets, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before sumatriptan succinate tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan succinate tablets have not been established for cluster headache. Sumatriptan succinate is a serotonin (5-HT 1B/1D ) receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. ( 1 ) Not indicated for the prophylactic therapy of migraine attacks. ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache. ( 1 )"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet. ( 2.1 ) A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan succinate tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan succinate tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan succinate tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan succinate tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan succinate tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan succinate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis."

Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death.

Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan succinate tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1 B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1 B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol : Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment in pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 is depicted in Figure 1. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. Sumatriptan-figure-1 Sumatriptan-figure-2"

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )].

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan succinate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan succinate tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Sumatriptan succinate tablets contain sumatriptan succinate, a selective 5-HT 1B/1D receptor agonist. Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-indole-5-methanesulfonamide succinate (1:1), and it has the following structure: The molecular formula is C 14 H 21 N 3 O 2 S\u00b7C 4 H 6 O 4, representing a molecular weight of 413.5. Sumatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline. Each sumatriptan succinate tablet for oral administration contains 35 mg, 70 mg, or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate, USP equivalent to 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg of sumatriptan, respectively. Each tablet also contains the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, D&C Red # 27 aluminum lake (100 mg only), dibasic calcium phosphate, hypromellose, iron oxide red (100 mg only), magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol (25 mg & 50 mg only), polysorbate 80 (25 mg & 50 mg only) propylene glycol (100 mg only), talc and titanium dioxide. chemical-structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol : Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Percentage of Patients with Headache Response (Mild or No Headache) 2 and 4 Hours following Treatment Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets 25 mg 2 h 4 h Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets 50 mg 2 h 4 h Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets 100 mg 2 h 4 h Placebo 2 h 4 h Trial 1 52% a 67% a (n = 298) 61% a , b 78% a , b (n = 296) 62% a , b 79% a , b (n = 296) 27% 38% (n = 94) Trial 2 52% a 70% a (n = 66) 50% a 68% a (n = 62) 56% a 71% a (n = 66) 26% 38% (n = 65) Trial 3 52% a 65% a (n = 48) 54% a 72% a (n = 46) 57% a 78% a (n = 46) 17% 19% (n = 47) a P<0.05 in comparison with placebo. b P<0.05 in comparison with 25 mg. The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment in pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 is depicted in Figure 1. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. Sumatriptan-figure-1 Sumatriptan-figure-2"

PATIENT INFORMATION Sumatriptan Succinate Tablets (sue-muh-TRIP-tan SUX-in-ate) What is the most important information I should know about sumatriptan succinate tablets? Sumatriptan succinate tablets can cause serious side effects, including: Heart attack and other heart problems. Heart problems may lead to death. Stop taking sumatriptan succinate tablets and get emergency medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms of a heart attack: \u2022 discomfort in the center of your chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or that goes away and comes back \u2022 severe tightness, pain, pressure, or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw \u2022 pain or discomfort in your arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach \u2022 shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort \u2022 breaking out in a cold sweat \u2022 nausea or vomiting \u2022 feeling lightheaded Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not for people with risk factors for heart disease unless a heart exam is done and shows no problem. You have a higher risk for heart disease if you: \u2022 have high blood pressure \u2022 have high cholesterol levels \u2022 smoke \u2022 are overweight \u2022 have diabetes \u2022 have a family history of heart disease What are sumatriptan succinate tablets? Sumatriptan succinate tablets are a prescription medicine used to treat acute migraine headaches with or without aura in adults.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet.( 2.1 ) A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets are 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25-mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50-mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14 )]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection: If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not 24 been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological : Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data : The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data : Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose-and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Special Populations Age : The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Male and Female Patients : In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications ( 4) , Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Male and Female Patients : In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications ( 4) , Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment- related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacitie : Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50-mg or 100-mg group when compared with the 25-mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50-mg and 100-mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

The averages displayed are based on pooled data from the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy. Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose of Sumatriptan Tablets or Other Medication to Treat Migraine over the 24 Hours following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet.( 2.1 ) A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets are 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25-mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50-mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14 )]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection: If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not 24 been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data : The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data : Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose-and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data : Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose-and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mgwithout serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Special Populations Age : The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Male and Female Patients : In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications ( 4) , Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment- related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacitie : Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50-mg or 100-mg group when compared with the 25-mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50-mg and 100-mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose of Sumatriptan Tablets or Other Medication to Treat Migraine over the 24 Hours following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. image description image description"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if occurs ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of Sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of Sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of Sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of Sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with Sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional injections of Sumatriptan injection. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with Sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue Sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with Sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving Sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to Sumatriptan injection. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of Sumatriptan injection. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of Sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of Sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% Sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% Sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% Sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Sumatriptan tablets, Sumatriptan nasal spray, and Sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and Sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of Sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of Sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data ) . In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data ) . There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with Sumatriptan injection. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6-mg dose of Sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated Sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of Sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral Sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral Sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal Sumatriptan injection. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral Sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal Sumatriptan injection are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving Sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan's development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of Sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

After a single 6-mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes). In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of Sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 3 times the human exposure after a 6-mg subcutaneous dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1,000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3 , onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6-mg Sumatriptan injection. Lower doses of Sumatriptan injection may also prove effective, although the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses. In Study 1, 6 different doses of Sumatriptan injection (n = 30 each group) were compared with placebo (n = 62) in a single-attack, parallel-group design; the dose-response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2 . Table 2. Proportion of Patients with Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Reactions by Time and by Dose of Sumatriptan Injection in Study 1 a Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication.

Headache relief, as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in 70% of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6-mg subcutaneous dose of Sumatriptan injection. Approximately 82% and 65% of patients treated with Sumatriptan injection 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours, respectively. Table 3 shows the 1- and 2-hour efficacy results for Sumatriptan injection 6 mg in Studies 2 and 3. Table 3. Proportion of Patients with Pain Relief and Relief of Migraine Symptoms after 1 and 2 Hours of Treatment in Studies 2 and 3 a P <0.05 versus placebo. b A successful outcome in terms of clinical disability was defined prospectively as ability to work mildly impaired or ability to work and function normally. c Includes patients that may have received an additional placebo injection 1 hour after the initial injection. d Includes patients that may have received an additional 6 mg of Sumatriptan injection 1 hour after the initial injection. 1-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo (n = 190) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 384) Placebo (n = 180) Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg (n = 350) Patients with pain relief (Grade 0/1) Patients with no pain Patients without nausea Patients without photophobia Patients with little or no clinical disability b 18% 5% 48% 23% 34% 70% a 48% a 73% a 56% a 76% a 26% 13% 50% 25% 34% 70% a 49% a 73% a 58% a 76% a 2-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo c Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg d Placebo c Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg d Patients with pain relief (Grade 0/1) Patients with no pain Patients without nausea Patients without photophobia Patients with little or no clinical disability b 31% 11% 56% 31% 42% 81% a 63% a 82% a 72% a 85% a 39% 19% 63% 35% 49% 82% a 65% a 81% a 71% a 84% a Sumatriptan injection also relieved photophobia, phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting associated with migraine attacks. The efficacy of Sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of Sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of Sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4 ). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 a P <0.05. n = Number of headaches treated.

Figure 1. Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injection a a The figure uses Kaplan-Meier (product limit) Survivorship Plot. Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with Sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with Sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours).

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction, Prinzmetal's Angina, Other Vasospasm-Related Events, Arrhythmias, and Cerebrovascular Events Inform patients that Sumatriptan injection may cause serious cardiovascular side effects such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Although serious cardiovascular events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, significant rise in blood pressure, weakness, and slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice if any indicative sign or symptoms are observed. Apprise patients of the importance of this follow-up [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 )] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that anaphylactic reactions have occurred in patients receiving Sumatriptan injection. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . Concomitant Use with Other Triptans or Ergot Medications Inform patients that use of Sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of another triptan or an ergot-type medication (including dihydroergotamine or methysergide) is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.3 )] . Serotonin Syndrome Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of Sumatriptan injection or other triptans, particularly during combined use with SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Medication Overuse Headache Inform patients that use of acute migraine drugs for 10 or more days per month may lead to an exacerbation of headache and encourage patients to record headache frequency and drug use (e.g., by keeping a headache diary) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Pregnancy Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant during treatment or plan to become pregnant [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Lactation Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )] . Ability to Perform Complex Tasks Treatment with Sumatriptan injection may cause somnolence and dizziness; instruct patients to evaluate their ability to perform complex tasks after administration of Sumatriptan injection. How to Use Sumatriptan injection Provide patients instruction on the proper use of Sumatriptan injection if they are able to self-administer Sumatriptan injection in medically unsupervised situations. Inform patients that the injection is intended to be given subcutaneously and intramuscular or intravascular delivery should be avoided. Instruct patients to use injection sites with an adequate skin and subcutaneous thickness to accommodate the length of the needle.

Sumatriptan injection is a prescription medicine used to treat acute migraine headaches with or without aura and acute cluster headaches in adults who have been diagnosed with migraine or cluster headaches. Sumatriptan injection is not used to treat other types of headaches such as hemiplegic (that make you unable to move on one side of your body) or basilar (rare form of migraine with aura) migraines. Sumatriptan injection is not used to prevent or decrease the number of migraine or cluster headaches you have. It is not known if Sumatriptan injection is safe and effective in children under 18 years of age. Do not take Sumatriptan injection if you have: heart problems or a history of heart problems. narrowing of blood vessels to your legs, arms, stomach, or kidneys (peripheral vascular disease). uncontrolled high blood pressure. severe liver problems. hemiplegic migraines or basilar migraines. If you are not sure if you have these types of migraines, ask your healthcare provider. had a stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or problems with your blood circulation. taken any of the following medicines in the last 24 hours: almotriptan (AXERT \u00ae ) eletriptan (RELPAX \u00ae ) frovatriptan (FROVA \u00ae ) naratriptan (AMERGE \u00ae ) rizatriptan (MAXALT \u00ae , MAXALT-MLT \u00ae ) sumatriptan and naproxen (TREXIMET \u00ae ) ergotamines (CAFERGOT \u00ae , ERGOMAR \u00ae , MIGERGOT \u00ae ) dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45 \u00ae , MIGRANAL \u00ae ) Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is listed above. an allergy to sumatriptan or any of the ingredients in Sumatriptan injection. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in Sumatriptan injection. Before taking Sumatriptan injection, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have high blood pressure have high cholesterol have diabetes smoke are overweight have heart problems or family history of heart problems or stroke have kidney problems have liver problems have had epilepsy or seizures are not using effective birth control are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Sumatriptan injection can harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Sumatriptan injection passes into your breast milk. It is not known if this can harm your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you take Sumatriptan injection. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Sumatriptan injection and certain other medicines can affect each other, causing serious side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take antidepressant medicines called: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider or pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take Sumatriptan injection? Certain people should take their first dose of Sumatriptan injection in their healthcare provider's office or in another medical setting. Ask your healthcare provider if you should take your first dose in a medical setting. Use Sumatriptan injection exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose. Do not change your dose without first talking with your healthcare provider. For adults, the usual dose is a single injection given just below the skin. You should give an injection as soon as the symptoms of your headache start, but it may be given at any time during a migraine or cluster headache attack. If you did not get any relief after the first injection, do not give a second injection without first talking with your healthcare provider. If your headache comes back or you only get some relief after your first injection, you can take a second injection 1 hour after the first injection, but not sooner. Do not take more than 12 mg in a 24-hour period. If you use too much Sumatriptan injection, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. You should write down when you have headaches and when you take Sumatriptan injection so you can talk with your healthcare provider about how Sumatriptan injection is working for you. What should I avoid while taking Sumatriptan injection? Sumatriptan injection can cause dizziness, weakness, or drowsiness. If you have these symptoms, do not drive a car, use machinery, or do anything where you need to be alert. What are the possible side effects of Sumatriptan injection? Sumatriptan injection may cause serious side effects. See \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Sumatriptan Injection?\u201d These serious side effects include: changes in color or sensation in your fingers and toes (Raynaud's syndrome) stomach and intestinal problems (gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events). Symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic ischemic events include: sudden or severe stomach pain stomach pain after meals weight loss fever nausea or vomiting constipation or diarrhea bloody diarrhea problems with blood circulation to your legs and feet (peripheral vascular ischemia). Symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia include: cramping and pain in your legs or hips feeling of heaviness or tightness in your leg muscles burning or aching pain in your feet or toes while resting numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs cold feeling or color changes in 1 or both legs or feet medication overuse headaches. Some people who use too many Sumatriptan injections may have worse headaches (medication overuse headache). If your headaches get worse, your healthcare provider may decide to stop your treatment with Sumatriptan injection. serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a rare but serious problem that can happen in people using Sumatriptan injection, especially if Sumatriptan injection is used with anti-depressant medicines called SSRIs or SNRIs. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms of serotonin syndrome: mental changes such as seeing things that are not there (hallucinations), agitation, or coma fast heartbeat changes in blood pressure high body temperature tight muscles trouble walking hives (itchy bumps); swelling of your tongue, mouth or throat. seizures. Seizures have happened in people taking Sumatriptan injection who have never had seizures before. Talk with your healthcare provider about your chance of having seizures while you take Sumatriptan injection. The most common side effects of Sumatriptan injection include: pain or redness at your injection site tingling or numbness in your fingers or toes dizziness warm, hot, burning feeling to your face (flushing) discomfort or stiffness in your neck feeling weak, drowsy, or tired Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of Sumatriptan injection. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Single dose of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg tablet.( 2.1 ) A second dose should only be considered if some response to the first dose was observed. Separate doses by at least 2 hours. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 200 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets are 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25-mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50-mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14 )]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection: If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not 24 been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before using additional sumatriptan tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan or a combination of these factors.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Other 5-HT 1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. (8.1) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population ( see Data ). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal ( see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data : The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73-to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data : Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose-and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6-mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Special Populations Age : The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Male and Female Patients : In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications ( 4) , Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment- related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacitie : Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50-mg or 100-mg group when compared with the 25-mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50-mg and 100-mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

Estimated Probability of Achieving Initial Headache Response within 4 Hours of Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a a The figure shows the probability over time of obtaining headache response (no or mild pain) following treatment with oral sumatriptan. The averages displayed are based on pooled data from the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy. Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose of Sumatriptan Tablets or Other Medication to Treat Migraine over the 24 Hours following the Initial Dose of Study Treatment in Pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 a a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. figure1 figure2"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if occurs. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan succinate tablets and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan succinate tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor."

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan succinate tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan succinate tablets and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan succinate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan succinate tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the T max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a T max 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , T max , and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol : Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment in pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 is depicted in Figure 1. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. Sumatriptan-figure-1 Sumatriptan-figure-2"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT 1D family) having only a weak affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 5A , and 5-HT 7 receptors and no significant affinity (as measured using standard radioligand binding assays) or pharmacological activity at 5-HT 2 , 5-HT 3 , or 5-HT 4 receptor subtypes or at alpha 1- , alpha 2- , or beta-adrenergic; dopamine 1 ; dopamine 2 ; muscarinic; or benzodiazepine receptors. The vascular 5-HT 1 receptor subtype that sumatriptan activates is present on cranial arteries in both dog and primate, on the human basilar artery, and in the vasculature of human dura mater and mediates vasoconstriction. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that sumatriptan also activates 5-HT 1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels. Such an action may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of sumatriptan in humans. In the anesthetized dog, sumatriptan selectively reduces the carotid arterial blood flow with little or no effect on arterial blood pressure or total peripheral resistance. In the cat, sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arteriovenous anastomoses while having little effect on blood flow or resistance in cerebral or extracerebral tissues. Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Special Populations Renal Impairment Renal Impairment:The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined, but little clinical effect would be expected as sumatriptan is largely metabolized to an inactive substance. Hepatic Impairment The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In 1 small study of hepatically impaired patients (N = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects, the hepatically impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and C max and a t max 40 minutes earlier compared to the healthy subjects (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Age The pharmacokinetics of oral sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age, 72 years; 2 males and 4 females) and in patients with migraine (mean age, 38 years; 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age, 30 years) (see PRECAUTIONS : Geriatric Use ). Gender In a study comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, C max , t max , and half-life. Race The systemic clearance and C max of sumatriptan were similar in black (N = 34) and Caucasian (N = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

      "Pharmacokinetics The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a C max of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean C max following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The C max is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the t max is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared to 2.0 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the C max after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). A food effect study involving administration of sumatriptan tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the C max and AUC were increased by 15% and 12 %, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Plasma protein binding is low (14% to 21%). The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated, but would be expected to be minor, given the low rate of protein binding. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.4 L/kg. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14 C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, indole acetic acid (IAA), which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), predominantly the A isoenzyme, and inhibitors of that enzyme may alter sumatriptan pharmacokinetics to increase systemic exposure. No significant effect was seen with an MAO-B inhibitor (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO) Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS ). Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a study of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan. Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan.",

      "CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptane tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan tablets at all doses compared to those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 studies, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 or 100 mg group when compared to the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 and 100 mg dose groups in any study. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 1. Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.

The averages displayed are based on pooled data from the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy. Kaplan-Meier plot with patients not achieving response and/or taking rescue within 240 minutes censored to 240 minutes. For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Study 1) and at 4 hours (Studies 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan tablets compared to placebo. As early as 2 hours in Studies 2 and 3 or 4 hours in Study 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2. The Estimated Probability of Patients Taking a Second Dose or Other Medication for Migraine Over the 24 Hours Following the Initial Dose of Study Treatmenta a Kaplan-Meier plot based on data obtained in the 3 clinical controlled trials providing evidence of efficacy with patients not using additional treatments censored to 24 hours. Plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose. No remedication was allowed within 2 hours postdose. There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the patient; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy. fig1 fig2"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Sumatriptan tablets are not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache, which is present in an older, predominantly male population."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Sumatriptan tablets should not be given to patients with history, symptoms, or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes. In addition, patients with other significant underlying cardiovascular diseases should not receive sumatriptane tablets. Ischemic cardiac syndromes include, but are not limited to, angina pectoris of any type (e.g., stable angina of effort, vasospastic forms of angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction, and silent myocardial ischemia. Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to, strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease (see WARNINGS ). Because sumatriptan tablets may increase blood pressure, they should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Concurrent administration of MAO-A inhibitors or use within 2 weeks of discontinuation of MAO-A inhibitor therapy is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Sumatriptan tablets should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine. Sumatriptan tablets and any ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medication (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) should not be used within 24 hours of each other, nor should sumatriptan and another 5-HT 1 agonist. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or any of their components. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse Cardiac Events Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient\u2019s medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician\u2019s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors. It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan. The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan. Drug-Associated Cardiac Events and Fatalities Serious adverse cardiac events, including acute myocardial infarction, life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, and death have been reported within a few hours following the administration of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. Considering the extent of use of sumatriptan in patients with migraine, the incidence of these events is extremely low. The fact that sumatriptan can cause coronary vasospasm, that some of these events have occurred in patients with no prior cardiac disease history and with documented absence of CAD, and the close proximity of the events to sumatriptan use support the conclusion that some of these cases were caused by the drug. In many cases, however, where there has been known underlying coronary artery disease, the relationship is uncertain. Premarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Of 6,348 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of oral sumatriptan, 2 experienced clinical adverse events shortly after receiving oral sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary vasospasm. Neither of these adverse events was associated with a serious clinical outcome. Among the more than 1,900 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled clinical trials of subcutaneous sumatriptan, there were 8 patients who sustained clinical events during or shortly after receiving sumatriptan that may have reflected coronary artery vasospasm. Six of these 8 patients had ECG changes consistent with transient ischemia, but without accompanying clinical symptoms or signs. Of these 8 patients, 4 had either findings suggestive of CAD or risk factors predictive of CAD prior to study enrollment. Among approximately 4,000 patients with migraine who participated in premarketing controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of sumatriptan nasal spray, 1 patient experienced an asymptomatic subendocardial infarction possibly subsequent to a coronary vasospastic event. Postmarketing Experience With Sumatriptan Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association with the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of sumatriptan and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of sumatriptan. Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include: coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death. Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery vasospasm. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). Other Vasospasm-Related Events Sumatriptan may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Both peripheral vascular ischemia and colonic ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea have been reported. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of sumatriptan. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack. Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including Sumatriptan, particularly during combined use with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Serotonin synd rome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g ., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperr eflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The on set of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Treatment with Sumatriptan treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension. Sumatriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (see CONTRAINDICATIONS) . Sumatriptan should be administered with caution to patients with controlled hypertension as transient increases in blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance have been observed in a small proportion of patients. Concomitant Drug Use In patients taking MAO-A inhibitors, sumatriptan plasma levels attained after treatment with recommended doses are 7-fold higher following oral administration than those obtained under other conditions. Accordingly, the coadministration of sumatriptan tablets and an MAO-A inhibitor is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid) reactions have occurred on rare occasions in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens (see CONTRAINDICATIONS )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS ). Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function. There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS ). For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose. Overuse: Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use. Information for Patients See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs. Laboratory Tests No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to and/or after treatment with sumatriptan. Drug Interactions Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of life\u2011threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS ). Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Sumatriptan tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: In carcinogenicity studies, rats and mice were given sumatriptan by oral gavage (rats: 104 weeks) or drinking water (mice: 78 weeks). Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. It is not clear whether the problem is associated with treatment of the males or females or both combined. In a similar study by the subcutaneous route there was no evidence of impaired fertility at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, which is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human breast milk following subcutaneous administration. Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Completed placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These studies did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse events observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse events in theses patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting events more commonly than older adolescents. Post-marketing experience includes a limited number of reports that describe pediatric patients who have experienced adverse events, some clinically serious, after use of subcutaneous sumatriptan and/or oral sumatriptan. These reports include events similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults. A myocardial infarct has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Since clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse events in pediatric patients who might receive injectable, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available, the use of sumatriptan in patients aged younger than 18 years is not recommended. Geriatric Use The use of sumatriptan in elderly patients is not recommended because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic function, they are at higher risk for CAD, and blood pressure increases may be more pronounced in the elderly (see WARNINGS )."

Average exposures achieved in mice receiving the highest dose (target dose of 160 mg/kg/day) were approximately 40 times the exposure attained in humans after the maximum recommended single oral dose of 100 mg. The highest dose administered to rats (160 mg/kg/day, reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during week 21) was approximately 15 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was not mutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activation when tested in 2 gene mutation assays (the Ames test and the in vitro mammalian Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT assay). In 2 cytogenetics assays (the in vitro human lymphocyte assay and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay) sumatriptan was not associated with clastogenic activity. Impairment of Fertility In a study in which male and female rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with 50 and 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 5 mg/kg/day, or approximately one half of the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis.

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects:Pregnancy Category C. In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral treatment with sumatriptan was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to rabbits, sumatriptan has been shown to be embryolethal. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, sumatriptan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In assessing this information, the following findings should be considered. Embryolethality When given orally or intravenously to pregnant rabbits daily throughout the period of organogenesis, sumatriptan caused embryolethality at doses at or close to those producing maternal toxicity. In the oral studies this dose was 100 mg/kg/day, and in the intravenous studies this dose was 2 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of the embryolethality is not known. The highest no-effect dose for embryolethality by the oral route was 50 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 9 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. By the intravenous route, the highest no-effect dose was 0.75 mg/kg/day, or approximately one tenth of the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. The intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis at 12.5 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, did not cause embryolethality. This dose is equivalent to the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Additionally, in a study in rats given subcutaneous sumatriptan daily prior to and throughout pregnancy at 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of increased embryo/fetal lethality. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenicity Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of blood vessel abnormalities (cervicothoracic and umbilical) at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for these effects was 15 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. A study in which rats were dosed daily with oral sumatriptan prior to and throughout gestation demonstrated embryo/fetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of rib variations) and an increased incidence of a syndrome of malformations (short tail/short body and vertebral disorganization) at 500 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a study in rats dosed daily with subcutaneous sumatriptan prior to and throughout pregnancy, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day, the maximum dose tested, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. This dose is equivalent to approximately 6 times the maximum recommended single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Pup Deaths Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the period of organogenesis resulted in a decrease in pup survival between birth and postnatal day 4 at doses of approximately 250 mg/kg/day or higher. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was approximately 60 mg/kg/day, or 6 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan from gestational day 17 through postnatal day 21 demonstrated a decrease in pup survival measured at postnatal days 2, 4, and 20 at the dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. In a similar study in rats by the subcutaneous route there was no increase in pup death at 81 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, which is equivalent to 8 times the maximum single recommended human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/m 2 basis."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS ) . Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS ). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ. Table 2.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness. Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events. Other Events Observed in Association With the Administration of Sumatriptan Tablets In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used sumatriptane tablets (25, 50, or 100 mg) and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (N = 6,348) exposed to sumatriptan tablets. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients, infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.

Other Events Observed in the Clinical Development of Sumatriptan The following adverse events occurred in clinical trials with sumatriptan succinate injection and sumatriptan succinate nasal spray. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Postmarketing Experience (Reports for Subcutaneous or Oral Sumatriptan) The following section enumerates potentially important adverse events that have occurred in clinical practice and that have been reported spontaneously to various surveillance systems. The events enumerated represent reports arising from both domestic and nondomestic use of oral or subcutaneous dosage forms of sumatriptan. The events enumerated include all except those already listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section above or those too general to be informative. Because the reports cite events reported spontaneously from worldwide postmarketing experience, frequency of events and the role of sumatriptan in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

Volunteers (N = 174) have received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse events. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In controlled clinical trials, single doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg of sumatriptan tablets were effective for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. There is evidence that doses of 50 and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than 25 mg (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). There is also evidence that doses of 100 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. Individuals may vary in response to doses of sumatriptan tablets. The choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, weighing the possible benefit of a higher dose with the potential for a greater risk of adverse events. If the headache returns or the patient has a partial response to the initial dose, the dose may be repeated after 2 hours, not to exceed a total daily dose of 200 mg. If a headache returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan succinate injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. Because of the potential of MAO-A inhibitors to cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of oral sumatriptan, their combined use is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hepatic disease/functional impairment may also cause unpredictable elevations in the bioavailability of orally administered sumatriptan. Consequently, if treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of liver disease, the maximum single dose should in general not exceed 50 mg (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for the basis of this recommendation)."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous use only. ( 2.1 ) Acute treatment of migraine: single dose of 4 mg or 6 mg. ( 2.1 ) Acute treatment of cluster headache: single dose of 6 mg. ( 2.1 ) Maximum dose in a 24-hour period: 12 mg, separate doses by at least 1 hour. ( 2.1 ) The needle shield of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a latex derivative) which may cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive patients. ( 2.2 ) Patients receiving doses other than 6 mg: Use the 6 mg single-dose vial (2.3) 2.1 Dosing Information The maximum single recommended adult dose of sumatriptan injection for the acute treatment of migraine or cluster headache is 6 mg injected subcutaneously. For the treatment of migraine, if side effects are dose limiting, the lower dose of 4 mg may be used [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. For the treatment of cluster headache, the efficacy of lower doses has not been established. The maximum cumulative dose that may be given in 24 hours is 12 mg, two 6 mg injections separated by at least 1 hour. A second 6 mg dose should only be considered if some response to a first injection was observed. 2.2 Administration Using the Sumatriptan Injection Autoinjector An autoinjector device is available for use with 6 mg prefilled syringe. With this autoinjector, the needle penetrates approximately 4 mm to 7 mm. The injection is intended to be given subcutaneously, and intramuscular or intravascular delivery must be avoided. Instruct patients on the proper use of sumatriptan injection autoinjector and direct them to use injection sites with an adequate skin and subcutaneous thickness to accommodate the length of the needle. The needle shield of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a latex derivative) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] . 2.3 Administration of Doses of Sumatriptan Injection Other than 6 mg In patients receiving doses other than 6 mg, use the 6 mg single-dose vial; do not use the sumatriptan injection autoinjector. Visually inspect the vial for particulate matter and discoloration before administration. Do not use if particulates and discolorations are noted."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal\u2019s angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemic reactions and peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue sumatriptan injection if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal\u2019s angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan injection. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. The needle shield of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a latex derivative) that has the potential to cause allergic reactions in latex-sensitive individuals. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraines (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache (Studies 4 and 5), no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine. Overall, the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials. Exceptions include reports of paresthesia (5% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), nausea and vomiting (4% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo), and bronchospasm (1% sumatriptan injection, 0% placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological Dystonia, tremor. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Breast pain [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Ergot-Containing Drugs Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan injection and other 5-HT 1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/TREXIMET* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. Use of sumatriptan may be associated with transient breast pain [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 pediatric migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available."

    "geriatric_use": [
      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Coronary vasospasm was observed after intravenous administration of sumatriptan injection [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Overdoses would be expected from animal data (dogs at 0.1 g/kg, rats at 2 g/kg) to possibly cause convulsions, tremor, inactivity, erythema of the extremities, reduced respiratory rate, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, injection site reactions (desquamation, hair loss, and scab formation), and paralysis. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is about 2 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]; therefore, monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT 1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5-HT 1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] . Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97% \u00b1 16% of that obtained following intravenous injection. After a single 6 mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males (age: 24 \u00b1 6 years, weight: 70 kg), the maximum serum concentration (C max ) of sumatriptan was (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) 74 \u00b1 15 ng/mL and the time to peak concentration (T max ) was 12 minutes after injection (range: 5 to 20 minutes) . In this trial, the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a C max of 61 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by manual injection versus 52 \u00b1 15 ng/mL by autoinjector techniques. The T max or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males (mean age: 33 years, mean weight: 77 kg) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 \u00b1 8 liters and the distribution half-life was 15 \u00b1 2 minutes . Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination After a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose, 22% \u00b1 4% was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38% \u00b1 7% as the IAA metabolite. Following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm, the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1,194 \u00b1 149 mL/min and the terminal half-life was 115 \u00b1 19 minutes. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated. There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls. The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and C max of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg/m2 basis. There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day. It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 3 times the human exposure after a 6 mg subcutaneous dose."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1,000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3, onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6 mg sumatriptan injection. Lower doses of sumatriptan injection may also prove effective, although the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses. In Study 1, 6 different doses of sumatriptan injection (n = 30 each group) were compared with placebo (n = 62) in a single-attack, parallel-group design; the dose-response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Proportion of Patients with Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Reactions by Time and by Dose of Sumatriptan Injection in Study 1 Dose of Sumatriptan Injection Percent Patients with Relief Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication. Adverse Reactions Incidence (%) at 10 Minutes at 30 Minutes at 1 Hour at 2 Hours Placebo 5 15 24 21 55 1 mg 10 40 43 40 63 2 mg 7 23 57 43 63 3 mg 17 47 57 60 77 4 mg 13 37 50 57 80 6 mg 10 63 73 70 83 8 mg 23 57 80 83 93 In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of sumatriptan injection 6 mg in 1,104 patients with moderate or severe migraine pain (Studies 2 and 3), the onset of relief was less than 10 minutes. Headache relief, as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache, was achieved in 70% of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan injection. Approximately 82% and 65% of patients treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours, respectively. Table 3 shows the 1- and 2-hour efficacy results for sumatriptan injection 6 mg in Studies 2 and 3. Table 3. Proportion of Patients with Pain Relief and Relief of Migraine Symptoms after 1 and 2 Hours of Treatment in Studies 2 and 3 1-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo (n = 190) Sumatriptan 6 mg (n = 384) Placebo (n = 180) Sumatriptan 6 mg (n = 350) Patients with pain relief (Grade 0/1) 18% 70% P<0.05 versus placebo. 26% 70% Patients with no pain 5% 48% 13% 49% Patients without nausea 48% 73% 50% 73% Patients without photophobia 23% 56% 25% 58% Patients with little or no clinical disability 34% 76% 34% 76% 2-Hour Data Study 2 Study 3 Placebo Includes patients that may have received an additional placebo injection 1 hour after the initial injection. Sumatriptan 6 mg Includes patients that may have received an additional 6 mg of sumatriptan injection 1 hour after the initial injection.

Similar efficacy was seen when patients self-administered sumatriptan injection using the sumatriptan injection autoinjector. The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura, duration of attack, gender or age of the patient, or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers). 14.2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover trials (Studies 4 and 5). Patients aged 21 to 65 years were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset. Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In both trials, the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo (see Table 4). Table 4. Proportion of Patients with Cluster Headache Relief by Time in Studies 4 and 5 Study 4 Study 5 Placebo (n = 39) Sumatriptan 6 mg (n = 39) Placebo (n = 88) Sumatriptan 6 mg (n = 92) Patients with pain relief (no/mild) 5 Minutes post-injection 8% 21% 7% 23% 10 Minutes post-injection 10% 49% P<0.05. 25% 49% 15 Minutes post-injection 26% 74% 35% 75% n = Number of headaches treated An estimate of the cumulative probability of a patient with a cluster headache obtaining relief after being treated with either sumatriptan injection or placebo is presented in Figure 1. The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require (request) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment. As a consequence, the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated (rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo-treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection). Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later-occurring headaches (i.e., those occurring after 2, but before 18 or 24 hours). figure1"

      "HOW TO USE Autoinjector for Sumatriptan Injection, USP 6 mg/0.5 mL Figure 1 (frontal view of autoinjector) This leaflet explains how to use the sumatriptan autoinjector. Read it TWICE before you begin the first step. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. For use only patients for whom a 6 mg dose has been prescribed. CAUTIONS: Check the expiration date on the autoinjector label . Keep the autoinjector in its box until you are ready to use it. Keep the sumatriptan injection autoinjector out of the reach of children. Do not remove the white needle shield from the autoinjector until you are ready to inject. NEVER put the white needle shield back into the autoinjector after injection. NEVER put or press thumb, fingers, or hand over white needle cover. Check the appearance of sumatriptan injection, through the inspection window. It must be a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution. Do not inject the solution if it looks discolored or cloudy or contains lumps, flakes, or particles. The needle shield of the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber, which is made from latex. This is a part you cannot usually see, but it could still cause an allergic reaction. Tell your healthcare provider if you are allergic to latex. Before you use sumatriptan injection autoinjector your healthcare provider should show you or your caregiver how to give an injection the right way. Be sure to change the injection site with each dose. HOW TO USE THE AUTOINJECTOR Wash your hands thoroughly. Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach it (autoinjector, alcohol or sterile swabs). Identify the application area with an adequate fatty tissue layer on top part of the thigh or back of the arm. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Wipe the injection site with alcohol or a new sterile swab and allow your skin to dry. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection. Take out the injector from show box. Figure 2 Pick up the autoinjector in one hand and smoothly remove the white needle shield by pulling it straight off. Do not twist it off, and do not recap the white needle shield, as either of these may damage the needle inside the autoinjector. The autoinjector has a cover that will protect you from needle sticks or loss of drug by accidental bumping or touching (See Figure 3). Figure 3 Without pressing the blue activation button, place the open end of the autoinjector on the injection site, straight up at a right angle (90\u00b0) and push the safety needle cover firmly against the skin to unlock. Continue to hold firmly against the skin (See Figure 4) . Figure 4 To start the injection (1) Press the Blue Button (first click will sound), (2) immediately release your thumb. This starts the injection. Do not lift the autoinjector off the skin. Wait until you hear the second 'click'. Once you hear the second click, lift the autoinjector straight up from the injection site. The injection is finished. The safety needle cover on the autoinjector will automatically extend to cover the needle. The needle will not be visible now. If you did not remove your thumb from the blue button, the second \u2018click\u2019 cannot be heard. If this happens, slowly count to 5 before lifting the autoinjector from the injection site. The inspection window will be blue, confirming the injection is complete. Verify that the inspection window is blue to ensure that the injection is complete before lifting the autoinjector (See Figure 5). Figure 5 The needle safety cover will move down over the needle and lock into place. There is no need to replace the white needle shield. If the inspection window is not blue, do not try to use the autoinjector again. If you suspect you have not received the full dose, do not repeat the injection using a new autoinjector. If you notice a spot of blood at the injection site, dab away with a cotton ball or tissues. Do not rub the injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a bandage. Figure 6 Discard sumatriptan injection autoinjector after use.

Use after sumatriptan injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan succinate tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to sumatriptan succinate or a combination of these factors.

Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan succinate tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.2 Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, coadministration of sumatriptan succinate tablets and other 5-HT1 agonists (e.g., triptans) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. 7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during coadministration of triptans and SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAO inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan succinate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan succinate tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "description": [
      "Sumatriptan succinate tablets contain sumatriptan succinate, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-indole-5-methanesulfonamide succinate (1:1), and it has the following structure: [chemical-structure] The molecular formula is C14H21N3O2S\u00b7C4H6O4, representing a molecular weight of 413.5. Sumatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline. Each sumatriptan succinate tablet for oral administration contains 35 mg, 70 mg, or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate, USP equivalent to 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg of sumatriptan, respectively.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmax following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the Cmax and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and Cmax and a Tmax 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and Cmax of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response over the 4 hours following treatment in pooled Trials 1, 2, and 3 is depicted in Figure 1. [Sumatriptan-figure-1] For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. [Sumatriptan-figure-2] There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy."

Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14)]. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan succinate tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan succinate tablets (up to 100 mg/day) may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established. 2.2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5.1 Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan succinate tablets. 5.2 Arrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if these disturbances occur. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal\u2019s variant angina. 5.4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan succinate tablets may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan succinate tablets. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established. 5.6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan succinate tablets, particularly during coadministration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan succinate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan succinate. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan succinate. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan succinate. 5.10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan succinate. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan succinate tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Data from a prospective pregnancy exposure registry and epidemiological studies of pregnant women have not detected an increased frequency of birth defects or a consistent pattern of birth defects among women exposed to sumatriptan compared with the general population (see Data). In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and pup mortality. When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits, sumatriptan was embryolethal (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The reported rate of major birth defects among deliveries to women with migraine ranged from 2.2% to 2.9% and the reported rate of miscarriage was 17%, which were similar to rates reported in women without migraine. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Several studies have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. Data Human Data: The Sumatriptan/Naratriptan/Treximet* (sumatriptan and naproxen sodium) Pregnancy Registry, a population-based international prospective study, collected data for sumatriptan from January 1996 to September 2012. The Registry documented outcomes of 626 infants and fetuses exposed to sumatriptan during pregnancy (528 with earliest exposure during the first trimester, 78 during the second trimester, 16 during the third trimester, and 4 unknown). The occurrence of major birth defects (excluding fetal deaths and induced abortions without reported defects and all spontaneous pregnancy losses) during first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan was 4.2% (20/478 [95% CI: 2.6% to 6.5%]) and during any trimester of exposure was 4.2% (24/576 [95% CI: 2.7% to 6.2%]). The sample size in this study had 80% power to detect at least a 1.73- to 1.91-fold increase in the rate of major malformations. The number of exposed pregnancy outcomes accumulated during the registry was insufficient to support definitive conclusions about overall malformation risk or for making comparisons of the frequencies of specific birth defects. Of the 20 infants with reported birth defects after exposure to sumatriptan in the first trimester, 4 infants had ventricular septal defects, including one infant who was exposed to both sumatriptan and naratriptan, and 3 infants had pyloric stenosis. No other birth defect was reported for more than 2 infants in this group. In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 2,257 births with first-trimester exposure to sumatriptan, 107 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 0.99 [95% CI: 0.91 to 1.21]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 415 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan during the first trimester, 15 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.69 to 1.94]) while for the 364 women who redeemed prescriptions for sumatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 20 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.83 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.88]), each compared with the population comparison group. Additional smaller observational studies evaluating use of sumatriptan during pregnancy have not suggested an increased risk of teratogenicity. Animal Data: Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel (cervicothoracic and umbilical) abnormalities. The highest no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities. Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality. The highest oral and intravenous no-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 (approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) and 0.75 mg/kg/day, respectively. Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity (decreased body weight, decreased ossification, increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities). The highest no-effect dose was 50 mg/kg/day, or approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis, there was a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this effect was 60 mg/kg/day, or approximately 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival. The highest no-effect dose for this finding was 100 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration (see Data). There is no information regarding sumatriptan concentrations in milk from lactating women following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets. There are no data on the effects of sumatriptan on the breastfed infant or the effects of sumatriptan on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for sumatriptan succinate tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sumatriptan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets. Data Following subcutaneous administration of a 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection in 5 lactating volunteers, sumatriptan was present in milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age. Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray (5 mg to 20 mg) in 1,248 adolescent migraineurs aged 12 to 17 years who treated a single attack. The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. Five controlled clinical trials (2 single-attack trials, 3 multiple-attack trials) evaluating oral sumatriptan succinate tablets (25 mg to 100 mg) in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous, oral, and/or intranasal sumatriptan succinate. These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults, including stroke, visual loss, and death. A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14-year-old male following the use of oral sumatriptan succinate tablets; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration. Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous, oral, or intranasal sumatriptan succinate are not presently available. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan succinate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The maximum single dose in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should not exceed 50 mg. Sumatriptan succinate tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

    "overdosage": [
      "Patients in clinical trials (N = 670) received single oral doses of 140 to 300 mg without significant adverse reactions. Volunteers (N = 174) received single oral doses of 140 to 400 mg without serious adverse reactions. Overdose in animals has been fatal and has been heralded by convulsions, tremor, paralysis, inactivity, ptosis, erythema of the extremities, abnormal respiration, cyanosis, ataxia, mydriasis, salivation, and lacrimation. The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and therefore monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan succinate tablets should continue for at least 12 hours or while symptoms or signs persist. It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan."

    "description": [
      "Sumatriptan succinate tablets contain sumatriptan succinate, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist. Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methyl-indole-5-methanesulfonamide succinate (1:1), and it has the following structure: [chemical-structure] The molecular formula is C14H21N3O2S\u00b7C4H6O4, representing a molecular weight of 413.5. Sumatriptan succinate is a white to off-white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline. Each sumatriptan succinate tablet for oral administration contains 35 mg, 70 mg, or 140 mg of sumatriptan succinate, USP equivalent to 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg of sumatriptan, respectively.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine headache through agonist effects at the 5-HT1B/1D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system, which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Peripheral (Small) Arteries In healthy volunteers (N = 18), a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral (small vessel) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance. Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan\u2019s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean maximum concentration following oral dosing with 25 mg is 18 ng/mL (range: 7 to 47 ng/mL) and 51 ng/mL (range: 28 to 100 ng/mL) following oral dosing with 100 mg of sumatriptan. This compares with a Cmax of 5 and 16 ng/mL following dosing with a 5 and 20 mg intranasal dose, respectively. The mean Cmax following a 6 mg subcutaneous injection is 71 ng/mL (range: 49 to 110 ng/mL). The bioavailability is approximately 15%, primarily due to presystemic metabolism and partly due to incomplete absorption. The Cmax is similar during a migraine attack and during a migraine-free period, but the Tmax is slightly later during the attack, approximately 2.5 hours compared with 2 hours. When given as a single dose, sumatriptan displays dose proportionality in its extent of absorption (area under the curve [AUC]) over the dose range of 25 to 200 mg, but the Cmax after 100 mg is approximately 25% less than expected (based on the 25 mg dose). Effect of Food: A food effect trial involving administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets 100 mg to healthy volunteers under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated that the Cmax and AUC were increased by 15% and 12%, respectively, when administered in the fed state. Distribution Protein binding, determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1,000 ng/mL is low, approximately 14% to 21%. The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated. The apparent volume of distribution is 2.7 L/kg. Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO, predominantly the A isoenzyme. Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid (IAA) or the IAA glucuronide, both of which are inactive. Elimination The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is approximately 2.5 hours. Radiolabeled 14C-sumatriptan administered orally is largely renally excreted (about 60%) with about 40% found in the feces. Most of the radiolabeled compound excreted in the urine is the major metabolite, IAA, which is inactive, or the IAA glucuronide. Only 3% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged sumatriptan. Specific Populations Age: The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly (mean age: 72 years, 2 males and 4 females) and in subjects with migraine (mean age: 38 years, 25 males and 155 females) were similar to that in healthy male subjects (mean age: 30 years). Patients with Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan has not been examined. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The liver plays an important role in the presystemic clearance of orally administered sumatriptan. Accordingly, the bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral administration may be markedly increased in patients with liver disease. In one small trial of patients with moderate liver impairment (n = 8) matched for sex, age, and weight with healthy subjects (n = 8), the hepatically-impaired patients had an approximately 70% increase in AUC and Cmax and a Tmax 40 minutes earlier compared with the healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied. The use of sumatriptan succinate tablets in this population is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Male and Female Patients: In a trial comparing females to males, no pharmacokinetic differences were observed between genders for AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and half-life. Racial Groups: The systemic clearance and Cmax of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black (n = 34) and Caucasian (n = 38) healthy male subjects. Oral sumatriptan has not been evaluated for race differences. Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors: Treatment with MAO-A inhibitors generally leads to an increase of sumatriptan plasma levels [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Due to gut and hepatic metabolic first-pass effects, the increase of systemic exposure after coadministration of an MAO-A inhibitor with oral sumatriptan is greater than after coadministration of the MAO inhibitors with subcutaneous sumatriptan. In a trial of 14 healthy females, pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. A small trial evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25 mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure. Alcohol: Alcohol consumed 30 minutes prior to sumatriptan ingestion had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat, sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively, at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day (the high dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg/kg/day during Week 21). There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration. Plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest doses tested were 20 and 8 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day. Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames], gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79/HGPRT, chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) assays. Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan (5, 50, 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was a treatment-related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both. When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period, there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium. Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested, 2 mg/kg/day, and were present after 1 month of treatment. Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60-week study. Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established. Plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 2 times that in humans at the MRHD."

      "The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these 3 trials were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range: 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptan succinate tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Trials 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or had worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 trials. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all trials, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 trial, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared with each other. In all 3 trials, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 and 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater among patients receiving sumatriptan succinate tablets at all doses compared with those who received placebo. In 1 of the 3 trials, there was a statistically significant greater percentage of patients with headache response at 2 and 4 hours in the 50 mg or 100 mg group when compared with the 25 mg dose groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the 50 mg and 100 mg dose groups in any trial. The results from the 3 controlled clinical trials are summarized in Table 2. Table 2.

[Sumatriptan-figure-1] For patients with migraine-associated nausea, photophobia, and/or phonophobia at baseline, there was a lower incidence of these symptoms at 2 hours (Trial 1) and at 4 hours (Trials 1, 2, and 3) following administration of sumatriptan succinate tablets compared with placebo. As early as 2 hours in Trials 2 and 3, or as early as 4 hours in Trial 1, through 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment, patients were allowed to use additional treatment for pain relief in the form of a second dose of study treatment or other medication. The estimated probability of patients taking a second dose or other medication for migraine over the 24 hours following the initial dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 2. [Sumatriptan-figure-2] There is evidence that doses above 50 mg do not provide a greater effect than 50 mg. There was no evidence to suggest that treatment with sumatriptan succinate tablets was associated with an increase in the severity of recurrent headaches. The efficacy of sumatriptan succinate tablets was unaffected by presence of aura; duration of headache prior to treatment; gender, age, or weight of the subject; relationship to menses; or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants). There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on efficacy."
