    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Miconazole nitrate exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against species of the genus Candida. The pharmacologic mode of action is unknown. Following intravaginal administration of miconazole nitrate, small amounts are absorbed. Administration of a single dose of miconazole nitrate vaginal suppositories (100 mg) to healthy subjects resulted in total recovery from the urine and feces of 0 . 85% (\u00b10 . 43%) of the administered dose. Animal studies indicate that the drug crossed the placenta and doses above those used in humans result in embryo and fetotoxicity (80 mg/kg, orally), although this has not been reported in human subjects (See PRECAUTIONS ). In multi-center clinical trials in 440 women with vulvovaginal candidiasis, the efficacy of treatment with the Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg for 3 days was compared with treatment for 7 days with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream 2%. The clinical cure rates (free of microbiological evidence and clinical signs and symptoms of candidiasis at 8 to 10 days and 30 to 35 days post therapy) were numerically lower, although not statistically different, with the 3-Day Suppository when compared with the 7-Day Cream."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg are indicated for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). Effectiveness in pregnancy has not been established. As miconazole nitrate is effective only for candidal vulvovaginitis, the diagnosis should be confirmed by KOH smear and/or cultures. Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis ( Trichomonas and Haemophilus vaginalis [Gardnerella] ) should be ruled out by appropriate laboratory methods."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Discontinue drug if sensitization or irritation is reported during use. The base contained in the suppository formulation may interact with certain latex products, such as that used in vaginal contraceptive diaphragms. Concurrent use is not recommended. Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP, 2% may be considered for use under these conditions. Laboratory Tests If there is a lack of response to Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, appropriate microbiological studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies to determine carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Fertility (Reproduction): Oral administration of miconazole nitrate in rats has been reported to produce prolonged gestation. However, this effect was not observed in oral rabbit studies. In addition, signs of fetal and embryo toxicity were reported in rat and rabbit studies, and dystocia was reported in rat studies after oral doses at and above 80 mg per kg. Intravaginal administration did not produce these effects in rats. Pregnancy Since imidazoles are absorbed in small amounts from the human vagina, they should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Clinical studies, during which miconazole nitrate vaginal cream and suppositories were used for up to 14 days, were reported to include 541 pregnant patients. Follow-up reports available in 471 of these patients reveal no adverse effects or complications attributable to miconazole nitrate therapy in infants born to these women. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether miconazole is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when miconazole nitrate is administered to a nursing woman."

See end flap for lot number and expiration date. A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive track, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don\u2019t actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes, monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better very quickly. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation (not the cream) may damage the diaphragm. Therefore, use of the diaphragm during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external sanitary pads or napkins until you have finished your medication or if the vaginal medication leaks. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. Don\u2019t douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. Don\u2019t scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION Contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. at 1-888-838-2872 or call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

      "Consumer Information Leaflet Miconazole 3 Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP (4%) Vaginal Antifungal Cures Most Vaginal Yeast Infections Why should I use Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP (4%)? Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP contains 4% miconazole nitrate cream that cures most vaginal yeast infections. Do not use miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%) if this is the first time you have vaginal discharge, itching, burning and discomfort. See your doctor or health professional first to find out the cause of your symptoms. If a doctor has told you in the past that you had a vaginal yeast infection and you have the same symptoms now (such as vaginal discharge, itching or burning), then miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%) may work for you. What is a vaginal yeast infection? A vaginal yeast infection is a common condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast (Candida) that may normally live in the vagina. Your doctor may call this infection \"monilia\" or \"candidiasis.\" Some women may have a yeast infection on the skin outside of the vagina (vulva) at the same time that they have a vaginal infection. Who can get a vaginal yeast infection? You can get a vaginal yeast infection at any age. It is most common during the childbearing years. Women who are pregnant or diabetic, taking antibiotics, birth control pills or steroids, or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to get repeated yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Some medical conditions can weaken the body's normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV \u2013 the virus that causes AIDS). The HIV virus causes the body to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. If you may have been exposed to HIV and get repeated vaginal yeast infections, you should see your doctor right away. For more information on HIV infection, please contact your doctor or the CDC National AIDS HOTLINE. The CDC phone number is: 1-800-232-4636 (English and Spanish), or 1-888-232-6348 (hearing impaired, TDD). How can I tell if I have a vaginal yeast infection? When you have a vaginal yeast infection, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: vaginal itching vaginal discharge that may be thick, white, and lumpy like cottage cheese vaginal soreness, irritation, or burning rash or redness on the skin outside the vagina (vulva) burning on urination painful vaginal intercourse (sex) Note: Vaginal yeast infections do NOT cause fever, chills, lower abdominal, back or shoulder pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or a missed period. These may be signs of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or a tubal pregnancy. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor right away. What are other causes of a vaginal discharge? It is normal to have a small amount of vaginal discharge at certain times of the month. This normal discharge may be clear or slightly white and does not cause itching, pain or a foul odor. The most common cause of an abnormal vaginal discharge is an infection. These infections include bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (Trich), gonorrhea (GC) and/or chlamydia. All of these may be transmitted sexually and are called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If you have more questions about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) call the CDC STD Hotline at 1-800-227-8922. Although many of the infections mentioned above can cause symptoms similar to a vaginal yeast infection (vaginal discharge, irritation and itching), their diagnosis must be made by a doctor so that proper treatment can be given. If these infections are not properly treated or if proper treatment is delayed, serious problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may result, which may prevent you from having children in the future. If you are pregnant and do not get the proper treatment, the infection may be passed to your baby before or during delivery and may cause your baby to have permanent damage. If you have multiple sex partners or a new sex partner, you should also ask a doctor before use to make sure you do not have an STD. Why do women get repeated vaginal yeast infections? Women may get repeated vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Listed below are some of the causes of repeated yeast infections: hormonal changes occurring a few days before the monthly period use of antibiotics use of some birth control pills pregnancy diabetes (\"sugar\" or \"high blood sugar\") clothing - wearing tight layers or moist clothing in the genital area weakened immune system - some drugs (such as chemotherapy or steroids) and medical conditions can weaken the body's normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV - the virus that causes AIDS). Infection with HIV causes the person to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections. If you get vaginal yeast infections often (such as once a month or 3 in 6 months), you should talk to a doctor. Are vaginal yeast infections sexually transmitted? Vaginal yeast infections are usually not spread by having intercourse (sex). However, if your partner has a rash, itching or discomfort in his genital area, he should contact a doctor to find out the cause of his symptoms and tell the doctor that you are treating your vaginal yeast infection with miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%). How can I prevent repeated vaginal yeast infections? To lower your chances of getting another yeast infection: Try to keep the genital area cool and dry. Yeast grow well in warm, moist areas. The following suggestions may be helpful: Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes. Change out of damp clothes or a wet bathing suit as soon as possible. If you use minipads when you are not having a menstrual period, change the minipads often. Talk with your doctor about any drugs you are now taking. You are more likely to get a vaginal yeast infection if you are taking certain drugs such as antibiotics, steroids, or birth control pills. Do not stop taking these drugs without first asking your doctor. A doctor may need to see you to make sure that you do not have other medical conditions such as diabetes or a weakened immune system. Can I use Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP (4%) during my menstrual period? Yes, this product can be used during your menstrual period. In fact, many women get vaginal yeast infections just before their period because of hormonal changes. Using miconazole nitrate vaginal cream during your period will not affect how well this product works. If you have started treatment and your period occurs, you should complete the full course of treatment. Do not use tampons while using this product, because tampons may remove some of the drug from the vagina. Use deodorant-free sanitary napkins or pads instead, and change them often. Can I use other vaginal products with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream USP (4%)? This drug should not be used with other vaginal products. Douches and tampons may remove some of the miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%) from the vagina. Spermicides may interfere with miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%). Condoms and diaphragms may be damaged by this product and fail to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). How can I get the best results when treating my infection? Use 1 applicator full of vaginal cream at bedtime, even during your menstrual period for 3 nights in a row. Dry the genital area thoroughly after a shower, bath or swim. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp clothes as soon as possible. A dry area is less likely to lead to the overgrowth of yeast. Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting clothes. Wipe from front to back after a bowel movement or after urination. Do not douche, because douching may wash the drug out of the vagina. Do not use tampons, because they remove some of the drug from the vagina. Use deodorant-free sanitary napkins or pads as needed. Do not use spermicides, as they may interfere with miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%). Do not have vaginal intercourse while using miconazole nitrate vaginal cream USP (4%). Do not scratch the skin outside the vagina. Scratching can cause more irritation and can spread the infection. Tell your doctor about any drugs you are now taking.

If you are taking any of these drugs do not stop taking them without first asking a doctor. If you have any other medical questions or concerns about vaginal yeast infections, call your doctor.

Regardless of your level of personal hygiene, your skin can be covered with microscopic organisms, including molds and yeast like fungi. While most microorganisms are not harmful, some can invade your skin and cause an infection. FUNGUS TYPES: Mold-like fungi called dermatophytes cause athlete\u2019s foot, jock itch, and ringworm of the skin or scalp. These fungi live on dead tissue of your hair, nails, and the outer layer of your skin. Poor hygiene, continually moist skin, and minor skin or nail injuries increase your chances of developing a fungal infection. Athlete\u2019s Foot and Jock Itch: Athlete\u2019s foot and jock itch are skin conditions caused by fungi that thrive in warm, moist areas. In all cases, itching and rash are the most noticeable symptoms. Athlete\u2019s foot produces itching, stinging, and burning on the soles of the feet, palms and between fingers and toes. Cracking and peeling of the skin may occur as well. Jock itch consists of itching in the groin and anal areas. Ringworm: Most common in children, ringworm causes a ringshaped pattern on the skin or scalp that grow outward as the infection spreads. The ring itself is the most actively infected area, while the skin inside the ring is less actively infected. Ringworm is very contagious and can be passed from shared hats, combs or brushes and barber tools. Ringworm infections can also develop from contact with pets or domestic animals. To treat the infection, wash the area and dry thoroughly. Apply a thin layer of Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution twice a day (morning and evening) over the affected area or as recommended by a doctor. Use daily for 4 weeks. PREVENTIONS AND TREATMENT: Athlete\u2019s Foot and Jock Itch: Good personal hygiene is essential in preventing or treating athlete\u2019s foot and jock itch. To prevent athlete\u2019s foot, wear well-fitting, well-ventilated shoes and change shoes and socks at least once a day. For treatment, apply Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution twice daily (morning and evening) or as directed by a doctor and pay special attention to the areas between toes. Apply twice a day on skin under nails and surrounding cuticle areas. Continue treatment twice a day for 4 weeks. To prevent jock itch, keep the groin and anal areas clean and dry, avoid chaffing and launder athletic supports frequently. For treatment, use Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution in the same manner over the affected area. Continue treatment for 2 weeks. Fingernails and Toenails-General Information: Your nails are produced from cells in the tips of your fingers and toes and are composed of laminated layers a protein called \u201cKeratin\u201d. Each nail grows towards the end of your finger or toe from a nail root that extends back into a groove of skin. Just in front of your nail root is your cuticle skin, which is attached to the nail surface and helps protect the new keratin cells that slowly emerge from below. The following lists conditions that may develop in your nails and how to take proper care of your nails. Paronychia Signs and Symptoms: (Red swollen area on the skin next to a nail): Paronychia is a superficial infection of the skin around the nail, most commonly caused by either staphylococci or yeast. Superficial pus blisters may appear. Pressing the affected area can produce oozing pus. Paronychia may also be caused by fungal infections and is common among those with diabetes mellitus and those who may have their hands in water for long periods. Like other fungal infections, paronychia may develop slowly, but prove to be very persistent. To treat the infection, soak the affected area in clean, warm water. This will help decrease inflammation of the tissues. After soaking, apply an antibacterial or antifungal agent to the affected area. Consult a doctor if you are not sure whether a paronychia infection is bacterial or fungal. Fungal Infections of the Nails: Fungus spores may attach themselves to the dense bed of keratin cells that make up your nails. These microscopic organisms can then digest the keratin and live within it. The resulting infection is called Onychomycosis (tinea of the nails), may persist indefinitely. It can cause nails to thicken, discolor, become lusterless and crumble along the edges. Onychomycosis can be contracted by walking barefoot in public places or may develop as a complication of athlete\u2019s foot. The associated infection of the foot or hand may be mild, producing no inflammation, or it may be acute, accompanied by blisters and painful swelling. Once the nails become involved, they may even become detached and shed and may be entirely destroyed. Consult a doctor if you suspect an Onychomycosis infection. A simple test can identify the fungus and rule out other diseases of the nails. A topical antifungal solution, such as Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution can treat the skin under the nails and surrounding cuticle area but will not penetrate the nails themselves. If you have a fungal infection that is disabling or excessively disfiguring, consult your doctor to find out the best treatment for you. GENERAL INFORMATION About Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution: Important Tips on Using Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution: Use Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution as soon as an infection is detected. This will kill the fungus before it gets out of control and prevents it from spreading to other areas."

      "Questions? FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: What is the active ingredient in Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution? Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution contains 2% miconazole nitrate, the maximum strength antifungal allowed by the FDA without a prescription. Do I apply Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution to the nail? No, nothing penetrates nails. Fungus is not growing on the nail but on the nail bed (skin). Apply Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution on skin under nails and surrounding cuticle areas twice a day (morning and evening). When can I expect results? You may start seeing results in as little as 4 to 6 weeks. How long does it take for a nail to grow? It could take 8 to 10 months for a nail to grow out completely. Why does your package say: \u201cThis product is not effective on the scalp or nails\u201d? In 1994, the FDA ruled that no over-the-counter antifungal product is effective on the nails. The FDA\u2019s opinion was that antifungal products available without a prescription could not penetrate the nails and are therefore, ineffective in treating them. The statement \u201cthis product is not effective on scalp or nails\u201d was subsequently required on the labels of all over-the-counter antifungal products. Fungus is an infection of the skin, not the nail. Can I use Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution for Athlete\u2019s Foot? Yes, Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution is a potent antifungal. It treats athlete\u2019s foot and ringworm. For athlete\u2019s foot and ringworm, apply Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution to the affected area twice a day for 4 weeks; pay special attention to spaces between the toes. Can children use Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution? Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution is safe and effective for children over 2 years of age. Children under 2 years of age, use only under physician supervision. What happens if Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution spills? Care should be taken to avoid spilling because Miconazole Nitrate 2% Solution may damage counter tops, porcelain, stainless steel, flooring, etc. For product questions, or to report a serious adverse event, call 1-855-361-3993."

      "EDUCATIONAL BROCHURE MICONAZOLE NITRATE VAGINAL SUPPOSITORIES, USP 200 mg (mye kon\u2019 a zole nye\u2019 trate), and MICONAZOLE NITRATE VAGINAL CREAM, USP 2% (mye kon\u2019 a zole nye\u2019 trate) VAGINAL ANTIFUNGAL Cures Most Vaginal Yeast Infections and Relieves Associated External Itching and Irritation Why should I use Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, USP and Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream, USP? Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, USP and Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream, USP contains 3 suppositories that cure most vaginal yeast infections, plus an external cream that can be used for relief of itching and irritation on the skin outside the vagina (vulva) due to a yeast infection. Do not use Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, USP and Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream, USP if this is the first time you have vaginal discharge, itching, burning and discomfort. See your doctor or health professional first to find out the cause of your symptoms. If a doctor has told you in the past that you had a vaginal yeast infection and you have the same symptoms now (such as vaginal discharge, itching or burning), then Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, USP and Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream, USP may work for you. What is a vaginal yeast infection? A vaginal yeast infection is a common condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast (Candida) that may normally live in the vagina. Your doctor may call this infection \u201cmonilia\u201d or \u201ccandidiasis\u201d. Some women may have a yeast infection on the skin outside of the vagina (vulva) at the same time that they have a vaginal infection. Who can get a vaginal yeast infection? You can get a vaginal yeast infection at any age. It is most common during the childbearing years. Women who are pregnant or diabetic, taking antibiotics, birth control pills or steroids, or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to get repeated yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Some medical conditions can weaken the body\u2019s normal ability to fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV - the virus that causes AIDS). The HIV virus causes the body to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. If you may have been exposed to HIV and get repeated vaginal yeast infections, you should see your doctor right away. For more information on HIV infection, please contact your doctor or the CDC National AIDS HOTLINE. The CDC phone numbers are: 1-800-CDC-INF0 (1-800-232-4636) (English and Spanish), or 1-888-232-6348 (hearing impaired, TDD) How can I tell if I have a vaginal yeast infection? When you have a vaginal yeast infection, you may have one or more of the following symptoms: \u2022 vaginal itching \u2022 vaginal discharge that may be thick, white, and lumpy like cottage cheese \u2022 vaginal soreness, irritation, or burning \u2022 rash or redness on the skin outside of the vagina (vulva) \u2022 burning on urination \u2022 painful vaginal intercourse (sex) Note: Vaginal yeast infections do NOT cause fever, chills, lower abdominal, back or shoulder pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or a missed period. These may be signs of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or a tubal pregnancy. If you have these symptoms, call your doctor right away. What are other causes of a vaginal discharge? It is normal to have a small amount of vaginal discharge at certain times of the month. This normal discharge may be clear or slightly white and does not cause itching, pain or a foul odor. The most common cause of an abnormal vaginal discharge is an infection. These infections include bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis (Trich), gonorrhea (GO) and/or chlamydia. All of these may be transmitted sexually and are called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). If you have more questions about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) call the CDC STD Hotline at 1-800-227-8922. Although many of the infections mentioned above can cause symptoms similar to a vaginal yeast infection (vaginal discharge, irritation and itching), their diagnosis must be made by a doctor so that proper treatment can be given. If these infections are not properly treated or if proper treatment is delayed, serious problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may result, which may prevent you from having children in the future. If you are pregnant and do not get the proper treatment, the infection may be passed to your baby before or during delivery and may cause your baby to have permanent damage. If you have multiple sex partners or a new sex partner, you should also ask a doctor before use to make sure you do not have an STD. Why do women get repeated vaginal yeast infections? Women may get repeated vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment. Listed below are some of the causes of repeated yeast infections: \u2022 hormonal changes occurring a few days before the monthly period \u2022 use of antibiotics \u2022 use of some birth control pills \u2022 pregnancy \u2022 diabetes (\u201csugar\u201d or \u201chigh blood sugar\u201d) \u2022 clothing - wearing tight layers or moist clothing in the genital area \u2022 weakened immune system - some drugs (such as chemotherapy or steroids) and medical conditions can weaken the body\u2019s normal abilityto fight infection. One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV - the virus that causes AIDS). Infection with HIV causes the person to be more likely to get infections, including vaginal yeast infections. If you get vaginal yeast infections often (such as once a month or 3 in 6 months), you should talk to a doctor. Are vaginal yeast infections sexually transmitted? Vaginal yeast infections are usually not spread by having intercourse (sex). However, if your partner has a rash, itching or discomfort in his genital area, he should contact a doctor to find out the cause of his symptoms and tell the doctor that you are treating your vaginal yeast infection with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories, USP and Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream, USP.
