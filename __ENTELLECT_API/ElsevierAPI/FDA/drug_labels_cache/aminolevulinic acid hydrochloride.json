    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral use only ( 2.1 ) Recommended reconstituted oral dose of Gleolan is 20 mg/kg. ( 2.1 ) Administer Gleolan to patient orally 3 hours (range 2 to 4 hours) before anesthesia. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for reconstitution information. ( 2.2 ) Use appropriate visualization techniques with appropriate surgical microscopes and light source filters. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose For oral use only The recommended oral dose of reconstituted Gleolan is 20 mg / kg body weight. More than 1 vial may be required. 2.2 Reconstitution of Gleolan Gleolan powder must be reconstituted prior to administration by a healthcare provider according to the following instructions: Determine the total number of vials needed to achieve the intended dose for the patient according to the equation below (rounded up to the nearest whole vial): # of vials = Patient Body Weight (kg) 75 kg / vial Completely remove the white cap and aluminum crimp seal from each vial. Remove and retain the rubber stopper from the vial. Using an appropriate volumetric measuring device (e.g., flask, graduated cylinder, dosing syringe), measure 50 mL of drinking water and add to each vial containing 1,500 mg of Gleolan. Gently swirl the vial to completely dissolve the powder. The resulting reconstituted solution (30 mg of Gleolan per mL) is clear and colorless to slightly yellowish. If required, replace the stopper and store reconstituted solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature prior to administration. 2.3 Gleolan Administration Gleolan is for ORAL USE ONLY. The reconstituted Gleolan solution is administered according to the following steps: Calculate the administration volume, in mL, to achieve the intended dose according to the following equation: Administration Volume (mL) = Patient Body Weight (kg) * 20 mg/kg 30 mg/mL Transfer the entire contents of the prepared vial(s) into an appropriate dosing container (e.g., oral medicine bottle); ensure the entire contents of the vials are transferred. After transfer, discard the empty vial(s). Using a disposable volumetric syringe, remove the administration volume of reconstituted Gleolan solution from the dosing container and transfer to a separate oral dosing container. Discard unneeded volume of Gleolan solution. Administer orally 3 hours (range 2 to 4 hours) prior to induction of anesthesia. 2.4 Imaging Instructions Gleolan should be used with a standard surgical operating microscope adapted with a blue light emitting light source (power density 40-80 mW/cm 2 ) and ancillary excitation and emission filters to visualize fluorescence excitation in the wavelength of 375 to 440 nm and for observation from 620 to 710 nm. Filters transmit porphyrin fluorescence as red-violet, as well as a fraction of backscattered blue excitation light necessary for distinguishing nonfluorescing tissue. Gleolan should only be used by neurosurgeons who have completed a training program on use of fluorescence in surgery. Training is provided by the distributor."

( 6.1 ) Adverse reactions occurring in < 1% of patients in the first 6 weeks after surgery were: chills, photosensitivity reaction, solar dermatitis, hypotension, abnormal liver function test, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) Neurologic events related to the surgical procedure occurred in 29% of patients and included: aphasia, hemiparesis, hemianopia, headache, seizure, hemiplegia, monoparesis, hypoesthesia, and brain edema. ( 6.1 ) Elevated liver enzymes occurred in clinical studies. There were no cases of liver failure. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NXDC toll-free at (844) 517-5252 and adverseevents@nxdevcorp.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Gleolan is supported by data from 5 open label clinical studies, which included 527 patients with glioma who received ALA HCl. Adverse reactions that occurred in > 1% of patients in the week following surgery were pyrexia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. Adverse reactions occurring in the first 6 weeks after surgery in < 1% of patients were: chills, photosensitivity reaction, solar dermatitis, hypotension, abnormal liver function test, and diarrhea. One patient experienced respiratory failure due to drug overdose [see Overdosage (10) ] . Neurologic Events Nervous system disorders occurred in 29% of patients within the first week after surgery. Events occurring in > 1% of patients included aphasia (8%), hemiparesis (7.8%), hemianopsia (3.2%), headache (2.7%), seizure (1.9%), hemiplegia (1.9%), monoparesis (1.3%) and hypoesthesia (1.1%). Brain edema occurred in < 1 % of patients in the first 6 weeks after surgery. In a randomized clinical trial (Study 3), the numbers of serious neurologic adverse events in the post operative period were higher in patients randomized to ALA fluorescence arm compared to the control arm. An imbalance was notable for the adverse events aphasia, ataxia, convulsion and hemianopsia, and is likely related to the higher amount of brain resection performed in the ALA arm. At longer follow up periods, the numbers between the two arms appeared similar [see Clinical Trials (14) ] . Elevated Liver Enzymes Worsening of \u2265 2 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grades in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) occurred in (15.8% and 11.6%, respectively) within the first week after surgery. Absolute levels ranged from 2 times to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for each parameter. At 6 weeks, ALT remained elevated in 2.9% of patients (range 2 to greater than 5 \u00d7 ULN), and GGT was elevated in 7.5% of patients (range 2 to greater than 10 \u00d7 ULN). No cases of liver failure occurred. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions are among those that have been identified during post-approval use of Gleolan outside of the United States. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune Disorders : anaphylactic shock, angioedema, drug eruption, urticaria, erythema. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : metabolic acidosis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available human data on Gleolan in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral ALA HCl administration to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at doses 3 times the maximum recommended human oral dose (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Animal data ALA HCl was administered to rabbits at oral doses of 15, 50 and 150 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.1, 0.6, and 3 times the maximum human recommended dose (MHRD), respectively based on AUC comparisons] from gestation days 6-18. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 50 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was 150 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary There are no data on the presence of ALA HCl in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Gleolan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Gleolan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To decrease exposure to Gleolan to the breastfed infant, advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of Gleolan for 24 hours (i.e., 5 to 6 half-lives). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Gleolan in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 527 subjects in clinical studies of Gleolan, 182 were 65 to < 75 years of age and 7 were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Because approximately one third of the ALA dose is excreted in urine as parent drug, ALA clearance may be reduced in patients with renal impairment; it is not known if dose adjustment is needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The contribution of the liver to the elimination of ALA following Gleolan dosing is unknown. ALA clearance may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment; it is not known if dose adjustment is needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ALA occurs endogenously as a metabolite that is formed in the mitochondria from succinyl-CoA and glycine. Exogenous administration of ALA leads to accumulation of the ALA metabolite PpIX in tumor cells. The reason for the accumulation of PpIX in neoplastic brain tissue is not known. During glioma surgery, Gleolan is used with an operating microscope adapted with a blue emitting light source (power density 40-80 mW/cm 2 ) and filters for excitation light of wavelength 375 to 440 nm, and observation at wavelengths of 620 to 710 nm. This allows tumor tissue to be visualized as red fluorescence. Tissue lacking sufficient PpIX concentrations appears blue. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of the timing of the Gleolan dosing on fluorescence intensity in brain tissue is unknown. The relationship between systemic ALA plasma concentrations at the time of visualization and fluorescence intensity in brain is also unknown. The dose of 20 mg / kg provided stronger ALA-induced fluorescence in glioma tissue by both visual and spectrophotometric assessment compared to lower doses tested. Cardiac Electrophysiology Administration of the approved recommended dose of Gleolan did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In 12 healthy subjects, the mean half-life of ALA following the recommended dose of Gleolan solution was 0.9 \u00b1 1.2 hours (mean \u00b1 std dev) with a range of 0.8 to 1.3 hours. Maximum concentrations of the PpIX metabolite (T max for PpIX) occurred with a median of 4 hours and a range of 1.2 to 7.8 hours. The elimination half-life of PpIX was 3.6 \u00b1 1.8 hours (mean \u00b1 std dev) with a range of 1.2 to 7.8 hours. Absorption In 12 healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability of ALA following the recommended dose of Gleolan solution was 100.0% \u00b1 1.1 with a range of 78.5% to 131.2%. Maximum ALA plasma concentrations were reached with a median of 0.8 hour (range 0.5 \u2013 1.0 hour). Distribution In in vitro experiments using ALA concentrations up to approximately 25% of the maximal concentration that occurs in plasma following the recommended dose of Gleolan solution, the mean protein binding of ALA was 12%. Elimination Metabolism Exogenous ALA is metabolized to PpIX, but the fraction of administered ALA that is metabolized to PpIX is unknown. The average plasma AUC of PpIX is less than 6% of that of ALA. Excretion In 12 healthy subjects, excretion of parent ALA in urine in the 12 hours following administration of the recommended dose of Gleolan solution was 34 \u00b1 8% (mean \u00b1 std dev) with a range of 27% to 57%. Specific Populations The effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ALA following Gleolan administration is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies suggest that phenytoin and other anti-convulsants may decrease cellular PpIX accumulation following Gleolan dosing. ALA is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A."

Study 1 was an open-label study of 33 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and Study 2 was an open-label study of 36 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. In Studies 1 and 2, after initial debulking was carried out under white light, biopsies were obtained under fluorescent light from fluorescent and nonfluorescent sites. Presence of fluorescence (positive/negative) was compared to tumor status (true/false) using histopathology as the reference standard. True positives and false positives among fluorescent biopsies and true negatives and false negatives among nonfluorescent biopsies are provided in Table 1. Study 3 was a randomized, multicenter study in 415 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of high-grade glioma by MRI. Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to ALA fluorescence arm or to white light control arm. Biopsies were obtained from tumor-core, tumor-margin and regions just distant to the tumor margins. In 349 patients high grade glioma was confirmed by a blinded central read and histopathology. The remaining patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease, abscess, low-grade glioma or other conditions. In patients with confirmed high-grade glioma randomized to the ALA fluorescence arm, presence of fluorescence at a biopsy level was compared to tumor status using histopathology as the reference standard (Table 1). In 4 patients with low-grade glioma (WHO Grade I or II) who received ALA HCl, 9 out of 10 biopsies were false negative. The extent of resection among patients with confirmed high-grade glioma in the ALA fluorescence arm was compared to that among patient in the control arm, with the \"completeness\" of resection being determined by a central blinded read of early post-surgical MRI. Percentage of patients who had \"completeness\" of resection was 64% in the ALA arm and 38% in the control arm, with the difference of 26% [95% CI: (16%, 36%)]. Table 1.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Administer AMELUZ only by a health care provider ( 2.1 ). AMELUZ is for topical use only ( 2.1 ). Use AMELUZ in combination with red light photodynamic therapy (PDT). See BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL user manual for detailed lamp safety and operating instructions ( 2.1 ). Photodynamic therapy with AMELUZ involves preparation of lesions, application of the product, occlusion and illumination with BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp ( 2.3 ). Apply an approximately 1 mm thick layer of AMELUZ to skin lesion(s). Cover individual lesions or the entire AK-field with AMELUZ. Include approximately 5 mm of the surrounding skin. Do not exceed an application area of 60 cm 2 . Do not use more than 6 grams of AMELUZ (3 tubes) at one time ( 2.2 ). Retreat lesions that have not completely resolved 3 months after the initial treatment ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information AMELUZ, in conjunction with lesion preparation, is only to be administered by a health care provider. AMELUZ is for topical use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Treat single lesions or an entire field affected by multiple lesions with AMELUZ, in combination with red light photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT requires administration of both AMELUZ and BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL light. Refer to BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL user manual for detailed lamp safety and operating instructions. Adhere to all safety instructions for both patient and medical personnel while conducting the PDT. 2.2 Recommended Dosage Apply an approximately 1-mm thick layer of AMELUZ to skin lesion(s). Cover individual lesions or the entire AK-field with AMELUZ. Include approximately 5 mm of the surrounding skin. Do not exceed an application area of 60 cm 2 . Do not use more than 6 grams of AMELUZ (3 tubes) at one time. Retreat lesions that have not completely resolved after 3 months after the initial treatment. 2.3 Administration Instructions PDT is a multi-stage process: Step 1. Preparation of Lesions Before applying AMELUZ, carefully wipe all lesions with an ethanol or isopropanol-soaked cotton pad to ensure degreasing of the skin. Figure 1A: Degreasing the skin Thereafter, remove any scaling and crusts and gently roughen all lesion surfaces, taking care to avoid bleeding. Figure 1B: Removal of scales and crusts Step 2. Application of AMELUZ Apply AMELUZ using glove protected fingertips or a spatula. Use sufficient amount of gel to cover individual lesions or the entire field: Lesion-directed treatment: Apply gel approximately 1 mm thick to one or more individual AK lesions and include approximately 5 mm of the surrounding healthy skin. Field-directed treatment: Apply gel approximately 1 mm thick to the treatment field. Apply gel to the lesions and the skin in-between the lesions. Additionally, cover approximately 5 mm of the surrounding healthy area. Do not exceed an application area of 60 cm 2 and do not use more than 6 grams of AMELUZ (3 tubes) at one time. The gel can be applied to healthy skin around the lesions. Avoid application near mucous membranes such as the eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears (keep a distance of 1 cm from these areas). In case of accidental contact with mucous membranes, thoroughly rinse with water [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Allow the gel to dry for approximately 10 minutes before applying occlusive dressing. Figure 2: Drug application Step 3. Occlusion for 3 Hours Cover the area where the gel has been applied with a light-blocking, occlusive dressing. Following 3 hours of occlusion, remove the dressing and wipe off any remaining gel. Figure 3: Occlusion Step 4. Illumination with Red Light For patient and medical personnel, wear suitable protective eyewear during illumination. Avoid staring directly into the light source [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Illuminate the treatment area with the BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp immediately after removing occlusion and any remaining gel. BF-RhodoLED and RhodoLED XL lamps are red light sources with a narrow spectrum around 635 nm that deliver a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm 2 . Calibration by the operator is not needed; the illumination time is calculated automatically. Physical measures such as cooling with an air stream or nebulized water may help reduce pain during illumination. Either the BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp can be used: BF-RhodoLED has an effective treatment area of 6 x 16 cm when an area of 8 x 18 cm is illuminated. Position the lamp head 5-8 cm from the skin\u2019s surface. Larger areas can be illuminated in several steps. RhodoLED XL has a curved configuration with an effective treatment area up to 23 x 29 cm. Position the lamp head of the RhodoLED XL 11-14 cm from the skin\u2019s surface. This usually allows a full-face illumination with the use of 5 panels. The smallest recommended number of panels to be used are 3 adjacent panels (see chapter 8.4.6 of RhodoLED XL user manual). Healthy untreated skin surrounding the AK lesions does not need protection during illumination. Figure 4A: Illumination with BF-RhodoLED Figure 4B: Illumination with RhodoLED XL If for any reason, the lesions cannot be illuminated within 3 hours after AMELUZ application, rinse off the gel with saline and water. For 2 days, protect the lesion sites and surrounding skin from sunlight or prolonged or intense light (e.g., tanning beds, sun lamps).

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of AMELUZ prior to photodynamic therapy (PDT). If allergic reaction occurs, wash off AMELUZ and institute appropriate therapy ( 5.1 ). Transient Amnestic Episodes: Transient amnestic episodes have been reported with use of AMELUZ in combination with PDT. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if amnesia or confusion occurs after treatment ( 5.2 ). Risk of BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL Lamp Induced Eye Injury: Patients and healthcare providers must wear protective eyewear before operating BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp ( 5.3 ). Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ with the eyes ( 5.4 ). Increased Photosensitivity: Protect treated lesions from sunlight exposure for 48 hours post treatment ( 5.5 ). Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Coagulation Disorders: Take special care to avoid bleeding during lesion preparation in patients with inherited or acquired coagulation disorders ( 5.6 ). Mucous Membrane Irritation: Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ with the mucous membranes ( 5.7 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Several cases of hypersensitivity were reported during postmarketing use of AMELUZ prior to PDT illumination [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. If allergic reactions occur, clean the area of skin where the product was applied and institute appropriate therapy. Inform patients and their caregivers that AMELUZ may cause hypersensitivity, potentially including severe courses (anaphylaxis). 5.2 Transient Amnestic Episodes Transient amnestic episodes have been reported during postmarketing use of AMELUZ in combination with photodynamic therapy. Inform patients and their caregivers that AMELUZ in combination with photodynamic therapy may cause transient amnestic episodes. Advise them to contact the healthcare provider if the patient develops amnesia after treatment. 5.3 Risk of BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL Lamp Induced Eye Injury BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp may cause eye irritation, glare, or injury. Before operating the lamp, personnel must refer to the user manual for specific warnings, cautions, and instructions. Eye exposure to the BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL light must be prevented. Protective eye equipment must be used by patient, healthcare providers and any person present during the illumination period. Avoid staring directly into the light source. 5.4 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Eyelid edema and dry eyes have occurred after PDT with AMELUZ. PDT with AMELUZ can cause ophthalmic adverse reactions. Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ with the eyes. Rinse eyes with water in case of accidental contact. 5.5 Increased Photosensitivity AMELUZ increases photosensitivity. Avoid sunlight, prolonged or intense light (e.g., tanning beds, sun lamps) on lesions and surrounding skin treated with AMELUZ for approximately 48 hours following treatment, whether exposed to illumination or not. Concomitant use of AMELUZ with other known photosensitizing agents may increase the risk of phototoxic reaction to PDT [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.6 Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Coagulation Disorders AMELUZ has not been tested on patients with inherited or acquired coagulation disorders. Take special care to avoid bleeding during lesion preparation in such patients [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Any bleeding must be stopped before application of the gel. 5.7 Risk of Mucous Membrane Irritation AMELUZ can cause mucous membrane irritation. AMELUZ is intended for topical use only. Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ to the mucous membranes. Rinse with water in case of accidental contact."

      "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u200b Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Transient Amnestic Episodes [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Risk of BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL Lamp Induced Eye Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Increased Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) were application site erythema, pain/burning, irritation, edema, pruritus, exfoliation, scab, induration, and vesicles ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biofrontera Inc. at 1-844-829-7434 or FDA at 1-800-332-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical program for AMELUZ included three double-blind and placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3), enrolling a total of 299 subjects that were treated with narrow band light. Trial subjects were adults greater than or equal to 49 years of age, and the majority had Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III. No subjects had Fitzpatrick skin type V or VI. Approximately 86% of subjects were male, and all subjects were White. For all three phase 3 trials, the enrolled subjects had mild to moderate AKs (Olsen grade 1 and 2) with 4 to 8 lesions on the face and scalp. Overall, 212 AMELUZ-treated subjects (n=32, n=55, and n=125) and 87 subjects receiving placebo (n=16, n=32, n=39) were illuminated with BF-RhodoLED or similar narrow spectrum lamps. For these trials, the maximal dose was one tube of AMELUZ (2 g) and the size of the application area was up to 20 cm 2 . Local skin reactions at the application site were observed in about 99.5% of subjects treated with AMELUZ and narrow spectrum lamps. The most frequent adverse reactions during and after PDT were application site erythema, pain, burning, irritation, edema, pruritus, exfoliation, scab, induration, and vesicles. Most adverse reactions occurred during illumination or shortly afterwards, were generally of mild or moderate intensity, and lasted for 1 to 4 days in most cases; in some cases, however, they persisted for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. Severe pain/burning occurred in up to 30% of subjects. In one case, the adverse reactions required interruption or discontinuation of the illumination. Table 1 presents the incidence of common (\u22651%, <10%) and very common (\u226510%) adverse reactions at the application site in randomized, multicenter trials which evaluated a maximal dose of one tube of AMELUZ (2 g) and an application area up to 20 cm 2 .

Less common (\u22650.1%, <1%) adverse reactions at the application site for AMELUZ maximal dose of one tube (2 g) and application area up to 20 cm 2 were hemorrhage and swelling. The adverse reactions not at the application site were blister, feeling hot, pruritus, pyrexia, scab, nervousness, pain, petechiae, rash pustular, skin erosion and ulcer. In a clinical trial designed to investigate the sensitization potential of aminolevulinic acid with 216 healthy subjects, 13 subjects (6%) developed allergic contact dermatitis after continuous exposure for 21 days with doses of aminolevulinic acid that were higher than doses normally used in the treatment of AK. In two open label clinical trials to evaluate safety and tolerability, 116 subjects with actinic keratosis (AK) on the face and scalp were treated with three tubes (6 g) of AMELUZ applied to a 60 cm\u00b2 area. Most adverse reactions observed were consistent with those reported in trials using one tube (2 g) of AMELUZ on a 20 cm\u00b2 area (see Table 1). Additional reactions which occurred in \u22651% of subjects when three tubes (6 g) of AMELUZ were applied to a 60 cm\u00b2 area included dry eyes, photosensitivity, and application site discoloration, dryness, papules, and fissures. The frequencies of certain adverse reactions at the application site in these trials\u2014exfoliation, itching, scabbing, and erosion\u2014were more than 10% higher with the larger dose (three tubes, 6 g) and treatment area (60 cm\u00b2) compared to the frequencies observed in the trials for the smaller dose (one tube, 2 g) and area (20 cm\u00b2). Severe application site pain was reported by 41% of the subjects treated with three tubes (6 g) on a 60 cm\u00b2 area. Most cases were reported during PDT illumination. A total of 15% of subjects discontinued illumination due to adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of AMELUZ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: allergic dermatitis, application site inflammation, application site discoloration. Eye disorders: eye irritation, diplopia, ocular hyperemia, photophobia, and blurred vision. General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue. Immune System disorders: hypersensitivity. Nervous system disorders: dysaesthesia, transient amnestic episodes."

Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with aminolevulinic acid. Systemic absorption of aminolevulinic acid in humans is negligible following topical administration of AMELUZ under maximal clinical use conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is not expected that maternal use of AMELUZ will result in fetal exposure to the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of aminolevulinic acid in human milk, the effects of aminolevulinic acid on the breastfed infant or on milk production. However, breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to the drug due to the negligible systemic absorption of aminolevulinic acid in humans following topical administration of AMELUZ under maximal clinical use conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for AMELUZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfeeding child from AMELUZ or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Photoactivation following topical application of AMELUZ occurs when aminolevulinic acid (prodrug) is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photoactive compound which accumulates in the skin. When exposed to red light of a suitable wavelength and energy, PpIX is activated resulting in an excited state of porphyrin molecules. In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are formed which causes damage to cellular components, and eventually destroys the cells. AMELUZ photodynamic therapy of AK lesions utilizes photoactivation of topically applied AMELUZ resulting from BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL illumination, which provides a red light of narrow spectrum and a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm 2 . 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of AMELUZ in the treatment of actinic keratosis are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Aminolevulinic acid acts as a prodrug to the photoactive metabolite protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Pharmacokinetics (PK) of aminolevulinic acid and PpIX were evaluated in two trials: In the first trial, a single dose of one entire tube of AMELUZ (2 grams) was applied under occlusion for 3 hours followed by PDT to a total area of 20 cm 2 in 12 adult subjects with mild to moderate AK with at least 10 AK lesions on the face or forehead. The mean \u00b1 SD baseline plasma aminolevulinic acid concentration was 20.16 \u00b1 16.53 ng/mL. In most subjects, an up to 2.5-fold increase of aminolevulinic acid plasma concentrations was observed during the first 3 hours after AMELUZ application. The mean \u00b1 SD area under the concentration time curve (AUC 0-t ) and maximum concentration (C max ) for baseline corrected aminolevulinic acid (n=12) were 142.83 \u00b1 75.50 ng\u00b7h/mL and 27.19 \u00b1 20.02 ng/mL, respectively. The median T max (time at which C max occurred) was 3 hours. The mean \u00b1 SD baseline plasma PpIX concentration was 3.27 \u00b1 2.40 ng/mL (n=12). The majority (about 55%) of the PpIX concentrations were below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 1 ng/mL) and baseline corrected values were negative in all subjects except for one. The baseline corrected AUC 0-t and C max in the single subject was 0.07 ng\u00b7h/mL and 0.29 ng/mL, respectively. In the second trial, a single dose of three entire tubes of AMELUZ (6 grams) was applied under occlusion for 3 hours followed by PDT to a total area of 60 cm 2 in 16 adult subjects with mild to severe AK with at least 12 AK lesions on the face and scalp. The mean \u00b1 SD baseline plasma aminolevulinic acid concentration was 13.53 \u00b1 1.58 ng/mL. In most subjects, an up to 2.5-fold increase of aminolevulinic acid plasma concentrations was observed during the first 3 hours after AMELUZ application. The mean \u00b1 SD area under the concentration time curve (AUC 0-t ) and maximum concentration (C max ) for baseline corrected aminolevulinic acid (n=16) were 134.24 \u00b1 87.97 ng\u00b7h/mL and 33.85 \u00b1 21.85 ng/mL, respectively. The median T max (time at which C max occurred) was 3 hours. The mean \u00b1 SD baseline plasma PpIX concentration was 1.93 \u00b1 0.42 ng/mL (n=15). The mean \u00b1 SD baseline corrected C max of PpIX was 0.67 \u00b1 0.78 ng/mL (n=13) with a median T max of 4 hours. The baseline corrected PpIX concentrations in 14 of 15 subjects were < 1 ng/mL."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Photoactivation following topical application of AMELUZ occurs when aminolevulinic acid (prodrug) is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photoactive compound which accumulates in the skin.

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of AMELUZ or aminolevulinic acid have not been performed. Aminolevulinic acid revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of three in vitro genotoxicity tests (Ames assay, HPRT test in V79 cells, and Human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay) and one in vivo genotoxicity test (mouse micronucleus assay). These genotoxicity studies were conducted without exposure to light. There is a literature report that indicates that aminolevulinic acid may cause genotoxic effects in the presence and in the absence of activating light. These genotoxic effects are likely caused by the formation of reactive oxygen species. Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with aminolevulinic acid because of the negligible systemic absorption of aminolevulinic acid in humans following topical administration of AMELUZ under maximal clinical use conditions."

      "14. CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of AMELUZ in combination with PDT using a narrow spectrum (red light lamp) source were evaluated in three randomized, multicenter trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3). Trials 2 and 3 were vehicle-controlled and double-blind. Trial 1 was double-blind with respect to vehicle and observer-blind regarding the active comparator arm. All clinical trials included a follow-up assessment after 6 and 12 months. In these trials, 212 subjects with 4 to 8 mild to moderate AK lesions on the face/forehead and/or bald scalp were treated with up to one tube (2 grams) of AMELUZ on an application area up to 20 cm\u00b2 and a narrow band spectrum lamp. Subjects ranged from 49 to 87 years of age (mean 71 years), and 92% had Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III. No subjects had Fitzpatrick skin type V or VI. Approximately 86% of subjects were male, and all subjects were White. All sessions were comprised of lesion preparation to roughen the surface and remove crusts, application of AMELUZ with occlusion for 3 hours, and removal of the residual gel. Subsequently, the entire treatment area was illuminated with a narrow spectrum red light source, a lamp of either 630 nm or 633 nm and a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm 2 . In Trial 3, illumination was performed with BF-RhodoLED, a red light source with a narrow spectrum around 635 nm and a light dose of approximately 37 J/cm 2 . In all trials, the lesions that were not completely cleared 12 weeks after the initial treatment were treated a second time with an identical regimen. In the trials, 42% (88/212) of subjects needed a second treatment. The primary endpoint for all trials was complete clearance 12 weeks after the last PDT. The results of Trials 1, 2 and 3 are presented in Table 2. Table 2: Complete Clearance 12 Weeks After the Last Narrow Spectrum PDT in Subjects with Actinic Keratoses in Trials 1, 2 and 3 AMELUZ Vehicle Trial 1 106/125 (85%) 5/39 (13%) Trial 2 27/32 (84%) 2/16 (13%) Trial 3 50/55 (91%) 7/32 (22%) Subjects who achieved complete clearance at 12 weeks after the last PDT entered a 12-month follow-up period. In the three trials, subjects who received AMELUZ with the narrowband PDT and achieved complete clearance 12 weeks after the last PDT had recurrence rates of 14%, 11%, and 25%, respectively (at 6 months) and 40%, 22%, and 37%, respectively (at 12 months). Recurrence was defined as the percentage of subjects with at least one recurrent lesion during the 6-month or 12-month follow-up period in subjects with completely cleared lesions 12 weeks after the last PDT."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For oral use only ( 2.1 ) Recommended reconstituted oral dose of Gleolan is 20 mg/kg. ( 2.1 ) Administer Gleolan to patient orally 3 hours (range 2 to 4 hours) before anesthesia. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for reconstitution information. ( 2.2 ) Use appropriate visualization techniques with appropriate surgical microscopes and light source filters. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose For oral use only The recommended oral dose of reconstituted Gleolan is 20 mg / kg body weight. More than 1 vial may be required. 2.2 Reconstitution of Gleolan Gleolan powder must be reconstituted prior to administration by a healthcare provider according to the following instructions: Determine the total number of vials needed to achieve the intended dose for the patient according to the equation below (rounded up to the nearest whole vial): # of vials = Patient Body Weight (kg) 75 kg / vial Completely remove the white cap and aluminum crimp seal from each vial. Remove and retain the rubber stopper from the vial. Using an appropriate volumetric measuring device (e.g., flask, graduated cylinder, dosing syringe), measure 50 mL of drinking water and add to each vial containing 1,500 mg of Gleolan. Gently swirl the vial to completely dissolve the powder. The resulting reconstituted solution (30 mg of Gleolan per mL) is clear and colorless to slightly yellowish. If required, replace the stopper and store reconstituted solution for up to 24 hours at room temperature prior to administration. 2.3 Gleolan Administration Gleolan is for ORAL USE ONLY. The reconstituted Gleolan solution is administered according to the following steps: Calculate the administration volume, in mL, to achieve the intended dose according to the following equation: Administration Volume (mL) = Patient Body Weight (kg) * 20 mg/kg 30 mg/mL Transfer the entire contents of the prepared vial(s) into an appropriate dosing container (e.g., oral medicine bottle); ensure the entire contents of the vials are transferred. After transfer, discard the empty vial(s). Using a disposable volumetric syringe, remove the administration volume of reconstituted Gleolan solution from the dosing container and transfer to a separate oral dosing container. Discard unneeded volume of Gleolan solution. Administer orally 3 hours (range 2 to 4 hours) prior to induction of anesthesia. 2.4 Imaging Instructions Gleolan should be used with a standard surgical operating microscope adapted with a blue light emitting light source (power density 40-80 mW/cm 2 ) and ancillary excitation and emission filters to visualize fluorescence excitation in the wavelength of 375 to 440 nm and for observation from 620 to 710 nm. Filters transmit porphyrin fluorescence as red-violet, as well as a fraction of backscattered blue excitation light necessary for distinguishing nonfluorescing tissue. Gleolan should only be used by neurosurgeons who have completed a training program on use of fluorescence in surgery. Training is provided by the distributor."

( 6.1 ) Neurologic events related to the surgical procedure occurred in 29% of patients and included: aphasia, hemiparesis, hemianopia, headache, seizure, hemiplegia, monoparesis, hypoesthesia, and brain edema. ( 6.1 ) Elevated liver enzymes occurred in clinical studies. There were no cases of liver failure.

The safety of Gleolan is supported by data from 5 open label clinical studies, which included 527 patients with glioma who received ALA HCl. Adverse reactions that occurred in > 1% of patients in the week following surgery were pyrexia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. Adverse reactions occurring in the first 6 weeks after surgery in < 1% of patients were: chills, photosensitivity reaction, solar dermatitis, hypotension, abnormal liver function test, and diarrhea. One patient experienced respiratory failure due to drug overdose [see Overdosage (10) ] . Neurologic Events Nervous system disorders occurred in 29% of patients within the first week after surgery. Events occurring in > 1% of patients included aphasia (8%), hemiparesis (7.8%), hemianopsia (3.2%), headache (2.7%), seizure (1.9%), hemiplegia (1.9%), monoparesis (1.3%) and hypoesthesia (1.1%). Brain edema occurred in < 1 % of patients in the first 6 weeks after surgery. In a randomized clinical trial (Study 3), the numbers of serious neurologic adverse events in the post operative period were higher in patients randomized to ALA fluorescence arm compared to the control arm. An imbalance was notable for the adverse events aphasia, ataxia, convulsion and hemianopsia, and is likely related to the higher amount of brain resection performed in the ALA arm. At longer follow up periods, the numbers between the two arms appeared similar [see Clinical Trials (14) ] . Elevated Liver Enzymes Worsening of \u2265 2 Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grades in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) occurred in (15.8% and 11.6%, respectively) within the first week after surgery. Absolute levels ranged from 2 times to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for each parameter. At 6 weeks, ALT remained elevated in 2.9% of patients (range 2 to greater than 5 X ULN), and GGT was elevated in 7.5% of patients (range 2 to greater than 10 X ULN). No cases of liver failure occurred. 6.2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions are among those that have been identified during post-approval use of Gleolan outside of the United States. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune Disorders : anaphylactic shock, angioedema, drug eruption, urticaria, erythema. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : metabolic acidosis."

In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral ALA HCl administration to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at doses 3 times the maximum recommended human oral dose (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Animal data ALA HCl was administered to rabbits at oral doses of 15, 50 and 150 mg/kg/day [approximately 0.1, 0.6, and 3 times the maximum human recommended dose (MHRD), respectively based on AUC comparisons] from gestation days 6-18. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was 50 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was 150 mg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation Risk summary There are no data on the presence of ALA HCl in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Gleolan and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Gleolan or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To decrease exposure to Gleolan to the breastfed infant, advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of Gleolan for 24 hours (i.e., 5 to 6 half-lives). 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Gleolan in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of 527 subjects in clinical studies of Gleolan, 182 were 65 to < 75 years of age and 7 were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients. 8.6 Patients with Renal Impairment Because approximately one third of the ALA dose is excreted in urine as parent drug, ALA clearance may be reduced in patients with renal impairment; it is not known if dose adjustment is needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The contribution of the liver to the elimination of ALA following Gleolan dosing is unknown.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action ALA occurs endogenously as a metabolite that is formed in the mitochondria from succinyl-CoA and glycine. Exogenous administration of ALA leads to accumulation of the ALA metabolite PpIX in tumor cells. The reason for the accumulation of PpIX in neoplastic brain tissue is not known. During glioma surgery, Gleolan is used with an operating microscope adapted with a blue emitting light source (power density 40-80 mW/cm 2 ) and filters for excitation light of wavelength 375 to 440 nm, and observation at wavelengths of 620 to 710 nm. This allows tumor tissue to be visualized as red fluorescence. Tissue lacking sufficient PpIX concentrations appears blue. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of the timing of the Gleolan dosing on fluorescence intensity in brain tissue is unknown. The relationship between systemic ALA plasma concentrations at the time of visualization and fluorescence intensity in brain is also unknown. The dose of 20 mg / kg provided stronger ALA-induced fluorescence in glioma tissue by both visual and spectrophotometric assessment compared to lower doses tested. Cardiac Electrophysiology Administration of the approved recommended dose of Gleolan did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In 12 healthy subjects, the mean half-life of ALA following the recommended dose of Gleolan solution was 0.9 \u00b1 1.2 hours (mean \u00b1 std dev) with a range of 0.8 to 1.3 hours. Maximum concentrations of the PpIX metabolite (T max for PpIX) occurred with a median of 4 hours and a range of 1.2 to 7.8 hours. The elimination half-life of PpIX was 3.6 \u00b1 1.8 hours (mean \u00b1 std dev) with a range of 1.2 to 7.8 hours. Absorption In 12 healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability of ALA following the recommended dose of Gleolan solution was 100.0% \u00b1 1.1 with a range of 78.5% to 131.2%. Maximum ALA plasma concentrations were reached with a median of 0.8 hour (range 0.5 \u2013 1.0 hour). Distribution In in vitro experiments using ALA concentrations up to approximately 25% of the maximal concentration that occurs in plasma following the recommended dose of Gleolan solution, the mean protein binding of ALA was 12%. Elimination Metabolism Exogenous ALA is metabolized to PpIX, but the fraction of administered ALA that is metabolized to PpIX is unknown. The average plasma AUC of PpIX is less than 6% of that of ALA. Excretion In 12 healthy subjects, excretion of parent ALA in urine in the 12 hours following administration of the recommended dose of Gleolan solution was 34 \u00b1 8% (mean \u00b1 std dev) with a range of 27% to 57%. Specific Populations The effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of ALA following Gleolan administration is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies suggest that phenytoin and other anti-convulsants may decrease cellular PpIX accumulation following Gleolan dosing. ALA is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A."

Study 1 was an open-label study of 33 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma and Study 2 was an open-label study of 36 patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. In Studies 1 and 2, after initial debulking was carried out under white light, biopsies were obtained under fluorescent light from fluorescent and nonfluorescent sites. Presence of fluorescence (positive/negative) was compared to tumor status (true/false) using histopathology as the reference standard. True positives and false positives among fluorescent biopsies and true negatives and false negatives among nonfluorescent biopsies are provided in Table 1. Study 3 was a randomized, multicenter study in 415 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of high-grade glioma by MRI. Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to ALA fluorescence arm or to white light control arm. Biopsies were obtained from tumor-core, tumor-margin and regions just distant to the tumor margins. In 349 patients high grade glioma was confirmed by a blinded central read and histopathology. The remaining patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease, abscess, low-grade glioma or other conditions. In patients with confirmed high-grade glioma randomized to the ALA fluorescence arm, presence of fluorescence at a biopsy level was compared to tumor status using histopathology as the reference standard (Table 1). In 4 patients with low-grade glioma (WHO Grade I or II) who received ALA HCl, 9 out of 10 biopsies were false negative. The extent of resection among patients with confirmed high-grade glioma in the ALA fluorescence arm was compared to that among patient in the control arm, with the \"completeness\" of resection being determined by a central blinded read of early post-surgical MRI. Percentage of patients who had \"completeness\" of resection was 64% in the ALA arm and 38% in the control arm, with the difference of 26% [95% CI: (16%, 36%)]. Table 1.

( 2.1 ) Illuminate with blue light using the BLU-U \u00ae Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator after the incubation time of( 2.2 ): 14 to 18 hours for scalp or face 3 hours for upper extremities, with occlusion LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy may be repeated a second time for lesions that have not completely resolved after 8 weeks ( 2.1 ) For topical use only. ( 2.1) See full prescribing information for complete dosage and administration instruction. ( 2 ) See BLU-U user manual for detailed lamp safety and operating instructions. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Preparation and Administration Overview After mixing, the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution 20% is intended for direct application to individual lesions diagnosed as actinic keratoses and not to perilesional skin. This product is not intended for application by patients or unqualified medical personnel. Application should involve lesions on the scalp, face or upper extremities; multiple lesions can be treated within a treatment region, but multiple treatment regions should not be treated simultaneously. The recommended treatment frequency is: one application of the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution and one dose of illumination per treatment region per 8-week treatment session. Each individual LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator should be used for only one patient. LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy for actinic keratoses is a two-stage process involving application of the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to the target lesions and then illumination with blue light using the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator after 3 hours for upper extremity lesions or after 14-18 hours for face or scalp lesions. TABLE 1 Schedule for LEVULAN KERASTICK Photodynamic Therapy 1 The incubation time is 14-18 hours for actinic keratosis lesions on the face or scalp. 2 The incubation time is 3 hours for actinic keratosis lesions on the upper extremities. LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution application Time window 1 for Blue Light Illumination for face or scalp Time window 2 for Blue Light Illumination for upper extremities 6 am 8 pm to Midnight 9 am 7 am 9 pm to 1 am 10 am 8 am 10 pm to 2 am 11 am 9 am 11 pm to 3 am 12 Noon 10 am Midnight to 4 am 1 pm 11 am 1 am to 5 am 2 pm 12 pm 2 am to 6 am 3 pm 1 pm 3 am to 7 am 4 pm 2 pm 4 am to 8 am 5 pm 3 pm 5 am to 9 am 6 pm 4 pm 6 am to 10 am 7 pm 5 pm 7 am to 11 am 8 pm 6 pm 8 am to Noon 9 pm 7 pm 9 am to 1 pm 10 pm 8 pm 10 am to 2 pm 11 pm 9 pm 11 am to 3 pm 12 Midnight 10 pm Noon to 4 pm 1 am If for any reason the patient cannot be given BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator treatment during the prescribed time after applying LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution, he or she may nonetheless experience sensations of stinging and/or burning if the photosensitized actinic keratoses are exposed to sunlight or prolonged or intense light at that time. Advise the patient to wear appropriate protective apparel (e.g., wide-brimmed hat, long sleeve shirt, gloves) to shade the treated actinic keratoses from sunlight or other bright light sources until at least 40 hours after the application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution. Advise the patient to reduce light exposure if the sensations of stinging and/or burning are experienced. LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy may be repeated a second time for lesions that have not completely resolved 8 weeks after the initial treatment. 2.2 Dosage and Administration Instructions Step A - Treatment of Actinic Keratoses with LEVULAN KERASTICK Topical Solution Preparation of Lesions Actinic keratoses targeted for treatment should be clean and dry prior to application of LEVULAN KERASTICK Topical Solution. Preparation of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution The LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator consists of a plastic tube containing two sealed glass ampules and an applicator tip. One ampule contains 1.5 mL of solution vehicle. The other ampule contains aminolevulinic acid HCl as a dry solid. LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution is prepared by crushing the glass ampoules and mixing the contents together. The LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution can be prepared either manually, or using the optional KERASTICK KRUSHER\u2122. These methods are illustrated below. Figure 1: Manual Preparation: Hold the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator with cap point up. Crush the bottom ampule containing the solution vehicle by applying finger pressure to Position A on the cardboard sleeve. Crush the top ampule containing the ALA HCl powder by applying finger pressure to Position B on the cardboard sleeve. To ensure both ampules are crushed continue crushing the applicator downward, applying finger pressure to Position A. Shake the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator gently for at least 30 seconds to completely dissolve the drug powder in the solution vehicle. Figure 2: Optional KERASTICK KRUSHER Preparation: Open the KERASTICK KRUSHER and properly position one LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator into the KRUSHER making sure to orient the LEVULAN KERASTICK label \u201cA\u201d with the KRUSHER \u201cA\u201d. Firmly seat the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator against the closed end of the KRUSHER (cap should be at open end). Once positioned properly, close and firmly press the top and bottom handles together until the top and bottom handles touch one another along their length. A distinct crushing sound is made during this process. Ensure KRUSHER handles meet. Remove the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator from the KRUSHER and shake the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator gently for at least 30 seconds to completely dissolve the drug powder in the solution vehicle. The LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution must be used within two (2) hours of activation. If the solution is not completely applied within 2 hours of the activation, discard the applicator. If needed, use a new LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator. Application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution Application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to Face or Scalp Lesions: Following solution admixture, remove the cap from the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator. The dry applicator tip should be dabbed on a gauze pad until uniformly wet with solution. Apply the solution directly to the target lesions by dabbing gently with the wet applicator tip. Enough solution should be applied to uniformly wet the lesion surface, including the edges without excess running or dripping. Once the initial application has dried, apply again in the same manner. Do not apply the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to the periorbital area or allow it to contact ocular or mucosal surfaces. Photosensitization of the treated lesions will take place over the next 14-18 hours. The actinic keratoses should not be washed during this time. The patient should be advised to wear a wide-brimmed hat or other protective apparel to shade the treated actinic keratoses from sunlight or other bright light sources until BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator treatment. The patient should be advised to reduce light exposure if the sensations of stinging and/or burning are experienced. At the visit for light illumination before treatment, the actinic keratoses treated with the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution should be gently rinsed with water and patted dry. For Lesions on the Upper Extremities Following solution mixture, remove the cap from the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator. The dry applicator tip should be dabbed on a gauze pad until uniformly wet with solution. Apply the solution directly to the target lesions by dabbing gently with the wet applicator tip. Enough solution should be applied to uniformly wet the lesion surface, including the edges without excess running or dripping. Occlude the upper extremity with low density polyethylene plastic wrap and hold in place with an elastic net dressing. Figure 3: Method of Occlusion for Upper Extremities The patient should wear a long-sleeved shirt and/or gloves or other protective apparel to shade the treated actinic keratoses from sunlight or other bright light sources until BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator treatment. Photosensitization of the treated lesions will take place over the next 3 hours. The actinic keratoses should not be washed during this time. Remove the occlusive dressing prior to light treatment and gently rinse the treated area(s) with water and pat dry before light illumination. Step B - Administration of BLU-U Treatment: LEVULAN KERASTICK is not intended for use with any device other than the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Use of LEVULAN KERASTICK without subsequent BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator illumination is not recommended. Photoactivation of actinic keratoses treated with LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution is accomplished with illumination from the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. A 1000 second (16 minutes 40 seconds) exposure is required to provide a 10 J/cm 2 light dose. During light treatment, both patients and medical personnel should be provided with blue blocking protective eyewear, as specified in the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator Operating Instructions. Please refer to the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator Operating Instructions for further information on conducting the light treatment. Patients should be advised that transient stinging and/or burning at the target lesion sites occurs during the period of light exposure. If blue light treatment with the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is interrupted or stopped for any reason, it should not be restarted and the patient should be advised to protect the treated lesions from exposure to sunlight or prolonged or intense light for at least 40 hours after applying the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution. For patients with facial lesions : The BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is positioned so that the base is slightly above the patient\u2019s shoulder, parallel to the patient\u2019s face. The BLU-U is positioned around the patient\u2019s head so the entire surface area to be treated lies between 2\u201d and 4\u201d from the BLU-U surface: a) The patient\u2019s nose should be no closer than 2\u201d from the surface; b) The patient\u2019s forehead and cheeks should be no further than 4\u201d from the surface; c) The sides of the patient\u2019s face and the patient\u2019s ears should be no closer than 2\u201d from the BLU-U surface. For patients with scalp lesions: The knobs on either side of the BLU-U are loosened and the BLU-U is rotated to a horizontal position. The BLU-U is positioned around the patient\u2019s head so the entire surface area to be treated lies between 2\u201d and 4\u201d from the BLU-U surface: a) The patient\u2019s scalp should be no closer than 2\u201d from the surface; b) The patient\u2019s scalp should be no further than 4\u201d from the surface; c) The sides of the patient\u2019s face and the patient\u2019s ears should be no closer than 2\u201d from the BLU-U surface. For patients with upper extremity lesions: The knobs on either side of the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator are loosened and the light is rotated to a horizontal position. The BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is positioned around the upper extremity so the entire surface area to be treated lies between 2\u201d and 4\u201d from the BLU-U surface. A table may be used to support the upper extremities during light treatment. Lavulan-01 Lavulan-02 Levulan-03"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Transient amnestic episodes have been reported during postmarketing use of LEVULAN KERASTICK in combination with BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Inform patients and their caregivers that LEVULAN KERASTICK in combination with PDT may cause transient amnestic episodes. Advise them to contact the healthcare provider if the patient develops amnesia after treatment. ( 5.1 ) Avoid exposure of the photosensitive actinic keratoses to sunlight or bright indoor light prior to blue light treatment. Protect treated lesions from sunlight exposure. Sunscreens will not protect the patient against photosensitivity reactions. ( 5.2 ) The LEVULAN KERASTICK for topical solution should be used by a qualified health professional. To avoid unintended photosensitivity, LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution should be applied to no more than 5 mm of perilesional skin surrounding each target actinic keratosis lesion. ( 5.2 ) Irritation may be experienced if this product is applied to eyes or mucous membranes. Do not apply to the eyes or to mucous membranes. Excessive irritation may be experienced if this product is applied under occlusion longer than 3 hours. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Transient Amnestic Episodes Transient amnestic episodes have been reported during postmarketing use of LEVULAN KERASTICK in combination with BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Inform patients and their caregivers that LEVULAN KERASTICK in combination with PDT may cause transient amnestic episodes. Advise them to contact the healthcare provider if the patient develops amnesia after treatment. 5.2 Photosensitivity After LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution has been applied, the treatment site will become photosensitive and patients should avoid exposure of the photosensitive treatment sites to sunlight or bright indoor light (e.g., examination lamps, operating room lamps, tanning beds, or lights at close proximity) for 40 hours. Exposure may result in a stinging and/or burning sensation and may cause erythema and/or edema of the lesions. Therefore, before exposure to sunlight, patients should protect treated lesions from the sun by wearing a wide-brimmed hat or similar head covering of light-opaque material, and/or a long-sleeved shirt and/or gloves. Sunscreens will not protect against photosensitivity reactions caused by visible light. It has not been determined if perspiration can spread the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution outside the treatment site to the eye or surrounding skin. Application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to perilesional areas of photodamaged skin of the face, scalp or upper extremities may result in photosensitization. Upon exposure to activating light from the BLU-U, such photosensitized skin may produce a stinging and/or burning sensation and may become erythematous and/or edematous in a manner similar to that of actinic keratoses treated with LEVULAN KERASTICK Photodynamic Therapy. Because of the potential for skin to become photosensitized, the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution should be used by a qualified health professional to apply drug to no more than 5mm of perilesional skin surrounding the target actinic keratosis lesions. If for any reason the patient cannot return for blue light treatment during the prescribed period after applying LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution, the patient should call the doctor. The patient should also continue to avoid exposure of the photosensitized lesions to sunlight or prolonged or intense light for at least 40 hours. If stinging and/or burning is noted, exposure to light should be reduced. 5.3 Irritation The LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution contains alcohol and is intended for topical use only. Irritation may be experienced if this product is applied to eyes or mucous membranes. Do not apply to the eyes or to mucous membranes. Excessive irritation may be experienced if this product is applied under occlusion longer than 3 hours. 5.4 Coagulation Defects The LEVULAN KERASTICK for topical solution has not been tested on patients with inherited or acquired coagulation defects."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Dermatology at 877-533-3872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rate observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, no non-cutaneous adverse events were found to be consistently associated with LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic Therapy Response: The constellation of transient local symptoms of stinging and/or burning, itching, erythema and edema as a result of LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy (PDT) was observed in all clinical trials for actinic keratoses treatment. Stinging and/or burning subsided between 1 minute and 24 hours after the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator was turned off, and appeared qualitatively similar to that perceived by patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria upon exposure to sunlight. There was no clear drug dose or light dose dependent change in the incidence or severity of stinging and/or burning. Local skin reactions at the application site were observed in 99% of subjects treated with LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution and BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. The most common local adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) were application site stinging/burning, erythema, edema, scaling/crusting, hypo/hyperpigmentation, itching, erosion, oozing/vesiculation/crusting, dryness. In the trials for face and scalp lesions, severe stinging and/or burning at one or more lesions during light treatment was reported by at least 50% of subjects. Severe stinging and/or burning also occurred during light treatment in 9% of subjects receiving treatment for upper extremity lesions. The majority of subjects reported that all lesions treated exhibited at least slight stinging and/or burning. In trials of the face and scalp, the sensation of stinging/burning appeared to reach a plateau at 6 minutes into the treatment. Less than 3% of subjects receiving treatment for face or scalp lesions discontinued light treatment because of stinging/burning. No subjects discontinued light treatment in the trial for upper extremity lesions. In trials for the face or scalp lesions, 99% of the active treatment group and 79% of the vehicle group experienced erythema shortly after treatment. In the trial for the upper extremity lesions, 99% of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution treatment group and 52% of the vehicle group experienced erythema on visit Days 2-3. Approximately 35% of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group had edema, while edema occurred in < 1% of the vehicle group. Both erythema and edema resolved to baseline or improved by 4 weeks after therapy for face or scalp. Edema resolved by 4 weeks and erythema resolved to baseline by 8 weeks for upper extremities. The application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to perilesional skin resulted in stinging, burning, erythema and edema similar to treated actinic keratoses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .

No subjects in the vehicle group reported itching or scabbing. Common ( > 2%, <10%) local cutaneous adverse reactions for face, scalp and upper extremities in the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group included wheal, scabbing, pustules, ulceration, bleeding, tenderness and dysesthesia. Uncommon (<2%) local cutaneous adverse reactions for face, scalp and upper extremities in the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group were flaking, pain, peeling, perilesional pruritic rash, excoriation and blistering. Common ( > 2%, <10%) adverse reactions not limited to the application site for upper extremities and occurring more frequently in the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group than in the vehicle group were sinusitis, squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of skin. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of LEVULAN KERASTICK. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rate observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, no non-cutaneous adverse events were found to be consistently associated with LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic Therapy Response: The constellation of transient local symptoms of stinging and/or burning, itching, erythema and edema as a result of LEVULAN KERASTICK photodynamic therapy (PDT) was observed in all clinical trials for actinic keratoses treatment. Stinging and/or burning subsided between 1 minute and 24 hours after the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator was turned off, and appeared qualitatively similar to that perceived by patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria upon exposure to sunlight. There was no clear drug dose or light dose dependent change in the incidence or severity of stinging and/or burning. Local skin reactions at the application site were observed in 99% of subjects treated with LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution and BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. The most common local adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) were application site stinging/burning, erythema, edema, scaling/crusting, hypo/hyperpigmentation, itching, erosion, oozing/vesiculation/crusting, dryness. In the trials for face and scalp lesions, severe stinging and/or burning at one or more lesions during light treatment was reported by at least 50% of subjects. Severe stinging and/or burning also occurred during light treatment in 9% of subjects receiving treatment for upper extremity lesions. The majority of subjects reported that all lesions treated exhibited at least slight stinging and/or burning. In trials of the face and scalp, the sensation of stinging/burning appeared to reach a plateau at 6 minutes into the treatment. Less than 3% of subjects receiving treatment for face or scalp lesions discontinued light treatment because of stinging/burning. No subjects discontinued light treatment in the trial for upper extremity lesions. In trials for the face or scalp lesions, 99% of the active treatment group and 79% of the vehicle group experienced erythema shortly after treatment. In the trial for the upper extremity lesions, 99% of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution treatment group and 52% of the vehicle group experienced erythema on visit Days 2-3. Approximately 35% of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group had edema, while edema occurred in < 1% of the vehicle group. Both erythema and edema resolved to baseline or improved by 4 weeks after therapy for face or scalp. Edema resolved by 4 weeks and erythema resolved to baseline by 8 weeks for upper extremities. The application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to perilesional skin resulted in stinging, burning, erythema and edema similar to treated actinic keratoses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .

No subjects in the vehicle group reported itching or scabbing. Common ( > 2%, <10%) local cutaneous adverse reactions for face, scalp and upper extremities in the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group included wheal, scabbing, pustules, ulceration, bleeding, tenderness and dysesthesia. Uncommon (<2%) local cutaneous adverse reactions for face, scalp and upper extremities in the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group were flaking, pain, peeling, perilesional pruritic rash, excoriation and blistering. Common ( > 2%, <10%) adverse reactions not limited to the application site for upper extremities and occurring more frequently in the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution group than in the vehicle group were sinusitis, squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of skin."

      "11 DESCRIPTION LEVULAN KERASTICK (aminolevulinic acid HCl) for topical solution, 20%, a porphyrin precursor, contains the hydrochloride salt of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), an endogenous 5-carbon aminoketone. ALA HCl is a white to off-white, odorless crystalline solid that is very soluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol, and practically insoluble in chloroform, hexane and mineral oil. The chemical name for ALA HCl is 5-amino-4-oxopentanoic acid hydrochloride (MW = 167.59). The structural formula is represented below: The LEVULAN KERASTICK for topical solution applicator is a two-component system consisting of a plastic tube containing two sealed glass ampules and an applicator tip. One ampule contains 1.5 mL of solution vehicle comprising alcohol USP (ethanol content = 48% v/v), water, laureth-4, isopropyl alcohol, and polyethylene glycol. The other ampule contains 354 mg of aminolevulinic acid HCl as a dry solid. The applicator tube is enclosed in a protective cardboard sleeve and cap. The 20% topical solution is prepared just prior to the time of use by breaking the ampules and mixing the contents by shaking the LEVULAN KERASTICK applicator. \u201cLEVULAN KERASTICK for topical solution\u201d refers to the drug product in its unmixed state, \u201cLEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution\u201d refers to the mixed drug product (in the applicator tube or after application), and \u201cLEVULAN KERASTICK\u201d refers to the applicator only.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Following the application of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution, photosensitization occurs through the metabolic conversion of aminolevulinic acid to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a photosensitizer, which accumulates in the skin. When exposed to light of appropriate wavelength and energy, the accumulated photoactive porphyrins produce a photodynamic reaction, resulting in a cytotoxic process dependent upon the simultaneous presence of oxygen. The absorption of light results in an excited state of porphyrin molecules, and subsequent spin transfer from photoreactive porphyrins to molecular oxygen generates singlet oxygen, which can further react to form superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. LEVULAN KERASTICK Photodynamic Therapy of actinic keratoses is the combination of photosensitization by application of the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to the lesions and subsequent illumination with BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics ALA does not exhibit fluorescence, while PpIX has a high fluorescence yield. Time-dependent changes in surface fluorescence have been used to determine PpIX accumulation and clearance in actinic keratoses and perilesional skin after application of the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution in 12 subjects. Peak fluorescence intensity was reached in 11 \u00b1 1 hr in actinic keratoses and 12 \u00b1 1 hr in perilesional skin. The mean clearance half-life of fluorescence for lesions was 30 \u00b1 10 hr and 28 \u00b1 6 hr for perilesional skin. The fluorescence in perilesional skin was similar to that in actinic keratoses. Therefore, the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution should only be applied to the affected skin. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Two human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted in subjects with minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses on the upper extremities, having at least 6 lesions on one upper extremity and at least 12 lesions on the other upper extremity. A single dose comprising of two topical applications of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution (each containing 354 mg ALA HCl) were directly applied to the lesions and occluded for 3 hours prior to light treatment. The first PK study was conducted in 29 subjects and PK parameters of ALA were assessed. The baseline-corrected mean \u00b1 SD of the maximum concentration (C max ) of ALA was 249.9 \u00b1 694.5 ng/mL and the median time to reach C max (T max ) was 2 hr post dose. The mean \u00b1 SD exposure to ALA, as expressed by area under the concentration time curve (AUC t ) was 669.9 \u00b1 1610 ng\u2219hr/mL. The mean \u00b1 SD elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of ALA was 5.7 \u00b1 3.9 hr. A second PK study was conducted in 14 subjects and PK parameters of ALA and PpIX were measured. The baseline-corrected PpIX concentrations were negative in at least 50% of samples in 50% (7/14) subjects and AUC could not be estimated reliably. The baseline-corrected mean \u00b1 SD of C max for ALA and PpIX was 95.6 \u00b1 120.6 ng/mL and 0.95 \u00b1 0.71 ng/mL, respectively. The median T max of ALA and PpIX was 2 hr post dose and 12 hr post dose, respectively. The mean AUC t of ALA was 261.1 \u00b1 229.3 ng\u2219hr/mL.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Actinic Keratoses of the Face or Scalp LEVULAN KERASTICK for topical solution plus blue light at 6-10.9 J/cm 2 , has been used to treat actinic keratoses of the face or scalp in 342 subjects in seven clinical trials. Phase 3 trials ALA-018 and ALA-019 were two, identically designed, multicenter, two-arm trials using LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus illumination from the BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator for 1000 seconds (16 minutes and 40 seconds) for a nominal exposure of 10 J/cm 2 . Subjects were excluded from these trials who had a history of cutaneous photosensitization, porphyria, hypersensitivity to porphyrins, photodermatosis, or inherited or acquired coagulation defects. A minimum of 4 and a maximum of 15 clinically typical, discrete, Grade 1 (slightly palpable actinic keratoses: better felt than seen), or Grade 2 (moderately thick actinic keratoses: easily seen and felt) target actinic keratoses were identified (see Table 5 for definitions). Target lesions on the face or on the scalp, but not on both locations in the same subject, received treatment. The subjects were randomized to receive treatment either with the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator or vehicle plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Subjects were randomized at a 3 to 1 LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution to vehicle ratio. A total of 243 subjects were enrolled in two Phase 3 trials (ALA-018, ALA-019). Lesions were designated as cleared (complete response) if the lesion had completely cleared and adherent scaling plaques of actinic keratoses were no longer evident on the surface of the treated skin when palpated. The percentage of subjects in whom 75% or more of treated lesions were cleared, and the percentage of subjects in whom 100% of treated lesions were cleared (Complete Responders), for each trial 8 weeks after treatment are shown in Table 4 .

For actinic keratoses with a variety of thicknesses (excluding very thick, Grade 3 actinic keratoses which were not studied in the Phase 3 trials), LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator is more effective than vehicle plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator, but as shown in Table 5 , the percentage of lesions with complete responses at 8 weeks after treatment with LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus blue light illumination was lower for those lesions that were thicker at baseline. Efficacy of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator on higher grade lesions was not studied in the Phase 3 clinical efficacy trials.

TABLE 7 Subject Responses at Week 12, Among Subjects Who Received One or Two Treatments LEVULAN KERASTICK Topical Solution + PDT Vehicle + PDT Subjects with > 75% of Actinic Keratosis Lesions Cleared Total No. Subjects 158/180 (88%) 12/61 (20%) Subjects with Face Lesions 127/138 (92%) 8/40 (20%) Subjects with Scalp Lesions 31/42 (74%) 4/21 (19%) Complete Responders Total No. Subjects 129/180 (72%) 7/61 (11%) Subjects with Face Lesions 108/138 (78%) 5/40 (13%) Subjects with Scalp Lesions 21/42 (50%) 2/21 (10%) Among Complete Responders at Week 8, 93% (in ALA-018) and 83% (in ALA-019) maintained complete response at Week 12. Among subjects with scalp lesions, the percentage of subjects with 100% of actinic keratosis lesions having complete response declined from Week 8 (55%) to Week 12 (50%), because there were more subjects with scalp lesions with 100% of actinic keratosis lesions cleared at Week 8 who had a recurrence of a lesion by Week 12 than there were subjects with scalp lesions who had retreatment of persistent lesions at Week 8 and who then achieved 100% of actinic keratosis lesions cleared by Week 12. Subjects did not receive follow-up past 12 weeks after the initial treatment. Subject outcomes recorded in the two Phase 3 trials are depicted in the following flowchart, in which Complete Responders are designated clear. Seven subjects in the active treatment arm and three subjects in the vehicle treatment arm withdrew or were lost to follow-up. Three subjects in the active treatment arm were treated at baseline but did not return for evaluation until Week 12. One subject in the active treatment arm and two in the vehicle treatment arm who were not clear at Week 8 did not receive retreatment. An open-label trial enrolled 110 subjects with 4 to 10 clinically typical, discrete actinic keratoses on the face or scalp, but not both locations. The target lesions were treated with the LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Any treated lesions that were not clear at Month 2 (Week 8) were re-treated. Subjects were followed monthly for 12 months. Lesions were designated as cleared if the lesion had completely cleared and adherent scaling plaques of actinic keratoses were no longer evident on the surface of the treated skin when palpated. The percentages of subjects in whom 100% of treated lesions were cleared (Complete Responders) by month, starting at Month 3 (Week 12), are shown in Figure 4. Of the 72 subjects with 100% of treated lesions cleared (Complete Responders) at Month 3, 53% had a recurrence by Month 12. A total of 748 individual lesions were treated; 539 were treated once and 209 were treated twice. At Month 3, 624 lesions (83%) were cleared. From Month 3 through Month 12 of the trial, 476 lesions (64%) remained clear. See Figure 5. Of the 624 treated lesions determined cleared at Month 3, 24% had recurred by Month 12, while 5% were lost to follow-up and their recurrence status is unknown. Levulan-05 Levulan-06 Levulan-07 14.2 Actinic Keratoses of the Upper Extremities The safety and efficacy of LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution plus BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator at 10J/cm 2 to treat actinic keratoses of the upper extremities has been evaluated in a multicenter randomized, parallel-group, evaluator-blinded, vehicle-controlled trial of 269 subjects. In this trial (CP0108), 269 subjects with 4 -15 mild to moderate actinic keratoses on the upper extremities (dorsal hand/forearm area between the elbow and the base of the fingers) were treated with LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution and BLU-U Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator. Subjects ranged from 45 to 90 years of age (mean 68 years) and 90% had Fitzpatrick Skin Type I, II or III. No subjects had Fitzpatrick Skin Type V or VI. Approximately 70% of subjects were male and all subjects were Caucasian. Subjects were randomized to treatment in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution or vehicle. Treatment was applied to 4-15 lesions on one dorsal hand/forearm on each subject, and occluded for the three-hour incubation period before treatment with 10 J/cm 2 blue light delivered at 10 mW/cm 2 . Treatment was repeated at Week 8 if any actinic keratosis lesions were present in the treatment area. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all actinic keratosis lesions in the treatment area 12 weeks after initial treatment. The results of the trial are presented in Table 8 . Table 8 \u2013 Number and Percentage of Subjects with Actinic Keratosis of the Upper Extremities Achieving Complete Clearance at Week 12 LEVULAN KERASTICK Topical Solution + PDT Vehicle + PDT CP0108 42/135 (31%) 17/134 (13%) Subject outcomes recorded in the trial of the upper extremities are depicted in the following flowchart. Subjects who achieved complete clearance at Week 12 entered a 12-month follow-up period. Subjects who received LEVULAN KERASTICK topical solution with blue light and achieved complete clearance at Week 12 in CP0108A had a recurrence rate of 58% (22/38) at 12 months, where recurrence was defined as the presence of at least one previously treated lesion in the treatment area at any visit during the 12-month follow-up period.
