      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion: Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on morphological diagnosis of APL. Confirm diagnosis by detection of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Leukocytosis: Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Intracranial Hypertension: Tretinoin capsules have been associated with benign intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Lipid Abnormalities: Patients experienced hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which may be reversible upon completion of treatment. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function test results at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Thromboembolic Events: Venous and arterial events have been reported; these events may occur during the first month of treatment with tretinoin capsules. ( 5.8 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use 2 effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.2 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation Syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in about 26% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic hypotension and it has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. This syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, as early as following the first dose. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in some cases due to progressive hypoxemia and several patients have died with multi-organ failure. At the first signs or symptoms of this syndrome, immediately administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules for moderate and severe differentiation syndrome until resolution [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on the morphological diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Confirm the diagnosis of APL by detection of the t(15;17) translocation using cytogenetic studies or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion using molecular diagnostic techniques. Tretinoin capsules are not recommended for use in patients without these genetic markers [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . 5.4 Leukocytosis Rapidly evolving leukocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occurred in about 40% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients who present with a baseline white blood cell count (WBC) > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L have an increased risk. Patients who receive chemotherapy with tretinoin capsules may be at a reduced risk. Rapidly evolving leukocytosis is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening complications. Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Retinoids, including tretinoin capsules, have been associated with intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Evaluate patients with these symptoms for intracranial hypertension, and, if present, institute appropriate care in concert with neurological assessment. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. The concomitant use of other products (e.g., tetracyclines) that can cause intracranial hypertension may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.6 Lipid Abnormalities Hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia has occurred in up to 60% of patients who received tretinoin capsules. These changes may be reversible upon completion of treatment. The clinical consequences of increased triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Elevated liver function test results occurred in 50% to 60% of patients during treatment with tretinoin capsules. Most of these abnormalities resolved without interruption of tretinoin capsules or after completion of treatment. Monitor liver function test at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules if liver function test results increase to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal values until resolution. 5.8 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction and renal infarct have been reported with tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. These events may occur during the first month of treatment. Patients taking anti-fibrinolytic agents may have an increased risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] .",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )], tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and increased spontaneous abortions and major fetal abnormalities related to the use of retinoids have been documented in humans. Reported malformations include abnormalities of the central nervous system, musculoskeletal system, external ear, eye, thymus and great vessels; and facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and parathyroid hormone deficiency. Some of these abnormalities were fatal. IQ scores less than 85, with or without obvious CNS abnormalities, have been reported in pediatrics exposed to retinoids in utero . Animal Data Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of tretinoin in human milk, the effects on the breastfeed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from tretinoin capsules in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfed during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Use in Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating tretinoin capsules. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to initiating tretinoin capsules with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to abstain continuously from sexual intercourse or to use two effective methods of contraception. Counsel patients to use two effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month after the last dose. Two methods of effective contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Refer females of reproductive potential to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on testicular toxicities observed in dogs, tretinoin capsules may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The reversibility of effect on fertility is unknown. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The maximum tolerated dose is lower in pediatric patients compared to adults. Some pediatric patients experience severe headache and intracranial hypertension, which required management with an analgesic and a lumbar puncture. Dose reduction may be considered for pediatric patients experiencing serious and/or intolerable adverse reactions. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Across clinical studies of tretinoin capsules, 21% were 60 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo . In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have not been characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of tretinoin capsules 22.5 mg/m 2 orally twice daily, the mean \u00b1 SD peak tretinoin concentrations after the first dose was 394 \u00b1 89 and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 138 \u00b1 139 ng/mL, while area under the curve (AUC) after the first dose was 537 \u00b1 191 ng\u00b7h/mL and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 249 \u00b1 185 ng\u00b7h/mL. Absorption Time to reach peak concentration was between 1 and 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of tretinoin capsules was approximately 50%. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of tretinoin capsules has not been characterized. Food increases the absorption of retinoids, as a class. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of tretinoin has not been determined. Protein binding is greater than 95%, predominately to albumin. Plasma protein binding remains constant over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of tretinoin following initial dosing is 0.5 to 2 hours in patients with APL. Metabolism Tretinoin induced its own metabolism with plasma concentrations after 1 week of continuous therapy decreased to one-third of their day 1 values. Tretinoin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2E and undergoes glucuronidation by UGT2B7. Metabolites include 9- cis retinoic acid, 13- cis retinoic acid, 4-oxo trans retinoic acid, 4-oxo cis retinoic acid, and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide. The metabolites 4-oxo retinoic acid and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide have one-third of the pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Excretion Following administration of radiolabeled tretinoin 2.75 mg and 50 mg (0.53 to 9.6 times the approved recommended dosage based on 1.7 m 2 ), approximately 63% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 72 hours and 31% appeared in the feces within 6 days. Specific Populations The effect of age, sex, race, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tretinoin is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Post Marketing Experience Strong CYP3A inhibitors: Tretinoin AUC increased by 72% following concomitant use with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor). Increased tretinoin toxicity has also been reported post-marketing with strong CYP3A inhibitors including certain antimycotics. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Increased tretinoin toxicity following concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with certain antimycotics that are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors has been reported post-marketing.

In a carcinogenicity study, female B5D2F1 mice pretreated with a carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN, intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) received dietary supplement of all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) for 12 months. Tretinoin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the diet (about 2 times the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) was shown to increase the rate of DEN-induced mouse hepatocellular carcinomas. Tretinoin in combination with 50 mg/kg of DEN also increased the incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Tretinoin was negative when tested in the Ames and Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT assays for mutagenicity. A 2-fold increase in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been demonstrated in human diploid fibroblasts, but other chromosome aberration assays, including an in vitro assay in human peripheral lymphocytes and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, did not show a clastogenic or aneuploidogenic effect. Adverse effects on fertility and reproductive performance were not observed in studies conducted in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 2/3 the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In a 6-week toxicology study in dogs, testicular degeneration, with increased numbers of immature spermatozoa, were observed at 10 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the equivalent human dose in mg/m 2 )."

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. GELS ARE FLAMMABLE.

A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream or Tretinoin Gel should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of overapplication by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS TRETINOIN CREAM TRETINOIN GEL Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using Cream \u2022 Gel For Topical Use Only THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream and Gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so , you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to Tretinoin and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS All questions of a medical nature should be taken up with your doctor. For more information about tretinoin, call Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX).

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.025% Acne Treatment For Topical Use Only IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinues the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions: General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed.

Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of over application by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be avoided during the use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., a hat) are recommended. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel."

There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. A limit teratology study performed in Sprague Dawley rats treated topically with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel or 0.025% tretinoin gel at a dose of 2 mL/kg during gestation days 6 to 15 did not result in teratogenic effects. Although no systemic levels of tretinoin were detected, craniofacial and heart abnormalities were described in drug-treated groups. These abnormalities are consistent with retinoid effects and occurred at 16 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel applied daily to a 50-kg person. Clindamycin : Reproductive developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (480 and 240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 180 mg/kg/day (140 and 70 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Tretinoin: Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits, and primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (32 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomologous monkey, a species in which tretinoin metabolism is closer to humans than in other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (324 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related teratogenic effects and increased abortion rates were reported in pigtail macaques. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during 2 decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to fetus is not known. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established. Clinical trials of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel included 2,086 patients aged 12 through 17 years with acne vulgaris.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin : [See Microbiology ( 12.4 ).] Tretinoin : Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In an open-label study of 17 patients with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, topical administration of approximately 3 grams of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel once daily for 5 days, clindamycin concentrations were quantifiable in all 17 patients starting from 1 hour post-dose. All plasma clindamycin concentrations were \u22645.56 ng/mL on Day 5, with the exception of 1 subject who had a maximum clindamycin concentration of 8.73 ng/mL at 4 hours post-dose. There was no appreciable increase in systemic exposure to tretinoin, as compared with the baseline value. The average tretinoin concentration across all sampling times on Day 5 ranged from 1.19 to 1.23 ng/mL compared with the corresponding baseline mean tretinoin concentration range of 1.16 to 1.30 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product. Mechanism of Action : Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing protein synthesis. Clindamycin has been shown to have in-vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) , an organism that has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes was not examined in clinical studies with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. P. acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented. Inducible Clindamycin Resistance : The treatment of acne with antimicrobials is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance in P. acnes as well as other bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes ). The use of clindamycin may result in developing inducible resistance in these organisms. This resistance is not detected by routine susceptibility testing. Cross Resistance : Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin."

Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was negative for mutagenic potential when evaluated in an in-vitro Ames Salmonella reversion assay. Clindamycin Phosphate and Tretinoin Gel was equivocal for clastogenic potential in the absence of metabolic activation when tested in an in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay. Clindamycin : Once-daily dermal administration of 1% clindamycin as clindamycin phosphate in the gel vehicle (32 mg/kg/day, 13 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) to mice for up to 2 years did not produce evidence of tumorigenicity. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day of clindamycin (240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Tretinoin : In 2 independent mouse studies where tretinoin was administered topically (0.025% or 0.1%) 3 times per week for up to 2 years no carcinogenicity was observed, with maximum effects of dermal amyloidosis. However, in a dermal carcinogenicity study in mice, tretinoin applied at a dose of 5.1 mcg (1.4 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) 3 times per week for 20 weeks acted as a weak promoter of skin tumor formation following a single application of dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA). In a study in female SENCAR mice, papillomas were induced by topical exposure to DMBA followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or mezerein for up to 20 weeks. Topical application of tretinoin prior to each application of promoting agent resulted in a reduction in the number of papillomas per mouse. However, papillomas resistant to topical tretinoin suppression were at higher risk for pre-malignant progression. Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photoco-carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies, employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to tretinoin and UV radiation. The photoco-carcinogenic potential of the clindamycin tretinoin combination is unknown. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should avoid exposure to sun. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in-vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both tests were negative. In oral fertility studies in rats treated with tretinoin, the no-observed-effect-level was 2 mg/kg/day (64 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison)."

However, in a dermal carcinogenicity study in mice, tretinoin applied at a dose of 5.1 mcg (1.4 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) 3 times per week for 20 weeks acted as a weak promoter of skin tumor formation following a single application of dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA). In a study in female SENCAR mice, papillomas were induced by topical exposure to DMBA followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or mezerein for up to 20 weeks. Topical application of tretinoin prior to each application of promoting agent resulted in a reduction in the number of papillomas per mouse. However, papillomas resistant to topical tretinoin suppression were at higher risk for pre-malignant progression. Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photoco-carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies, employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to tretinoin and UV radiation. The photoco-carcinogenic potential of the clindamycin tretinoin combination is unknown. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should avoid exposure to sun. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in-vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in-vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both tests were negative. In oral fertility studies in rats treated with tretinoin, the no-observed-effect-level was 2 mg/kg/day (64 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris, was evaluated in 12-week multi-center, randomized, blinded studies in subjects 12 years and older. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a 2-grade improvement from baseline to Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and a mean absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in 2 out of 3 (total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory) lesion counts. The IGA scoring scale used in all the clinical trials for clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is as follows: 0 Clear Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris. 1 Almost Clear Skin almost clear; rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red) requiring no further treatment in the Investigator\u2019s opinion. 2 Mild Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodulo-cystic lesions). 3 Moderate Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident; several-to-many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 1 small nodulo-cystic lesion. 4 Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent; many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulo-cystic lesions. 5 Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate; variable numbers of comedones, many papules/pustules and nodulo-cystic lesions. In Studies 1, 1,649 subjects were randomized to clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, clindamycin gel, tretinoin gel, and vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 17 years and 58% were females. At baseline, subjects had an average of 71 total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 25.5 lesions and the mean number of non- inflammatory lesions was 45.1 lesions. The majority of subjects enrolled with a baseline IGA score of 3. The efficacy results at Week 12 are presented in Table 3 . Table 3 .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion : Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on morphological diagnosis of APL. Confirm diagnosis by detection of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Leukocytosis : Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Intracranial Hypertension : Tretinoin capsules have been associated with benign intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Lipid Abnormalities : Patients experienced hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which may be reversible upon completion of treatment. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function test results at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Thromboembolic Events : Venous and arterial events have been reported; these events may occur during the first month of treatment with tretinoin capsules. ( 5.8 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use 2 effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.2 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation Syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in about 26% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic hypotension and it has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. This syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, as early as following the first dose. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in some cases due to progressive hypoxemia and several patients have died with multi-organ failure. At the first signs or symptoms of this syndrome, immediately administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules for moderate and severe differentiation syndrome until resolution [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on the morphological diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Confirm the diagnosis of APL by detection of the t(15;17) translocation using cytogenetic studies or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion using molecular diagnostic techniques. Tretinoin capsules are not recommended for use in patients without these genetic markers [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . 5.4 Leukocytosis Rapidly evolving leukocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occurred in about 40% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients who present with a baseline white blood cell count (WBC) > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L have an increased risk. Patients who receive chemotherapy with tretinoin capsules may be at a reduced risk. Rapidly evolving leukocytosis is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening complications. Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Retinoids, including tretinoin capsules, have been associated with intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Evaluate patients with these symptoms for intracranial hypertension, and, if present, institute appropriate care in concert with neurological assessment. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. The concomitant use of other products (e.g., tetracyclines) that can cause intracranial hypertension may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.6 Lipid Abnormalities Hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia has occurred in up to 60% of patients who received tretinoin capsules. These changes may be reversible upon completion of treatment. The clinical consequences of increased triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Elevated liver function test results occurred in 50% to 60% of patients during treatment with tretinoin capsules. Most of these abnormalities resolved without interruption of tretinoin capsules or after completion of treatment. Monitor liver function test at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules if liver function test results increase to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal values until resolution. 5.8 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction and renal infarct have been reported with tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. These events may occur during the first month of treatment. Patients taking anti-fibrinolytic agents may have an increased risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] ."

Monitor patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors concomitantly with tretinoin capsules more frequently for adverse reactions. Tretinoin is a CYP3A substrate . Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases tretinoin plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease tretinoin plasma concentrations, which may reduce its efficacy. Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers if possible. 7.2 Concomitant Use of Products Known to Cause Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension has been reported in patients who received tretinoin capsules and concomitant use of other products that can cause intracranial hypertension, such as tetracyclines, may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products agents that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . 7.3 Vitamin A The concomitant use of vitamin A with tretinoin capsules may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with vitamin A. 7.4 Anti-fibrinolytic Agents Fatal thrombotic complications have been reported in patients who have received tretinoin capsules and concomitant use of anti-fibrinolytic agents may increase the risk.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )], tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and increased spontaneous abortions and major fetal abnormalities related to the use of retinoids have been documented in humans. Reported malformations include abnormalities of the central nervous system, musculoskeletal system, external ear, eye, thymus and great vessels; and facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and parathyroid hormone deficiency. Some of these abnormalities were fatal. IQ scores less than 85, with or without obvious CNS abnormalities, have been reported in pediatrics exposed to retinoids in utero. Animal Data Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of tretinoin in human milk, the effects on the breastfeed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from tretinoin in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfed during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Use in Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating tretinoin capsules. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to initiating tretinoin capsules with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to abstain continuously from sexual intercourse or to use two effective methods of contraception. Counsel patients to use two effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month after the last dose. Two methods of effective contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Refer females of reproductive potential to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on testicular toxicities observed in dogs, tretinoin capsules may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The reversibility of effect on fertility is unknown. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules has been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The maximum tolerated dose is lower in pediatric patients compared to adults. Some pediatric patients experience severe headache and intracranial hypertension, which required management with an analgesic and a lumbar puncture. Dose reduction may be considered for pediatric patients experiencing serious and/or intolerable adverse reactions. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Across clinical studies of tretinoin capsules, 21% were 60 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo. In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have not been characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of tretinoin capsules 22.5 mg/m 2 orally twice daily, the mean \u00b1 SD peak tretinoin concentrations after the first dose was 394 \u00b1 89 and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 138 \u00b1 139 ng/mL, while area under the curve (AUC) after the first dose was 537 \u00b1 191 ng\u00b7h/mL and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 249 \u00b1 185 ng\u00b7h/mL. Absorption Time to reach peak concentration was between 1 and 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of tretinoin capsules was approximately 50%. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of tretinoin capsules has not been characterized. Food increases the absorption of retinoids, as a class. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of tretinoin has not been determined. Protein binding is greater than 95%, predominately to albumin. Plasma protein binding remains constant over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of tretinoin following initial dosing is 0.5 to 2 hours in patients with APL. Metabolism Tretinoin induced its own metabolism with plasma concentrations after 1 week of continuous therapy decreased to one-third of their day 1 values. Tretinoin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2E and undergoes glucuronidation by UGT2B7. Metabolites include 9- cis retinoic acid, 13- cis retinoic acid, 4-oxo trans retinoic acid, 4-oxo cis retinoic acid, and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide. The metabolites 4-oxo retinoic acid and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide have one-third of the pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Excretion Following administration of radiolabeled tretinoin 2.75 mg and 50 mg (0.53 to 9.6 times the approved recommended dosage based on 1.7 m 2 ), approximately 63% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 72 hours and 31% appeared in the feces within 6 days. Specific Populations The effect of age, sex, race, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tretinoin is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Post Marketing Experience Strong CYP3A inhibitors: Tretinoin AUC increased by 72% following concomitant use with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor). Increased tretinoin toxicity has also been reported post-marketing with strong CYP3A inhibitors including certain antimycotics. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Increased tretinoin toxicity following concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with certain antimycotics that are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors has been reported post-marketing. In Vitro Studies Effect of Tretinoin on Transporters: Tretinoin does not inhibit P-gp and BCRP in vitro."

In a carcinogenicity study, female B5D2F1 mice pretreated with a carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN, intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) received dietary supplement of all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) for 12 months. Tretinoin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the diet (about 2 times the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) was shown to increase the rate of DEN-induced mouse hepatocellular carcinomas. Tretinoin in combination with 50 mg/kg of DEN also increased the incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Tretinoin was negative when tested in the Ames and Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT assays for mutagenicity. A 2-fold increase in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been demonstrated in human diploid fibroblasts, but other chromosome aberration assays, including an in vitro assay in human peripheral lymphocytes and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, did not show a clastogenic or aneuploidogenic effect. Adverse effects on fertility and reproductive performance were not observed in studies conducted in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 2/3 the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis).

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinues the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light form a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS All questions of a medical nature should be taken up with your doctor. For more information about tretinoin, call our toll-free number: 1-866-923-4914.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For topical use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area in a thin layer. Areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. A transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging may be noted on application. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or the frequency of application increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily dosing frequencies. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. If tolerated, this should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therapeutic results may be noticed after two weeks, but more than seven weeks of therapy are required before consistent beneficial effects are observed. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, paranasal creases of the nose, and mucous membranes. Patients treated with tretinoin gel microsphere may use cosmetics. Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, products that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, or spices should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Avoid contact with the peel of limes. Particular caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of topical over-the-counter acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin gel (microsphere). It also is advisable to allow the effects of such preparations to subside before use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) is begun. Apply a thin layer of tretinoin gel microsphere once daily, before bedtime, to skin where lesions occur. Keep away from eyes, mouth, nasal creases, and mucous membranes.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should not be used on eczematous or sunburned skin due to potential for severe irritation. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Avoid unprotected exposure to sunlight including sunlamps (UV light), when using tretinoin gel (microsphere) due to potential for increased photosensitization. Use sunscreen of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during exposure. ( 5.2 ) Avoid use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) with weather extremes, such as wind or cold due to potential for increased irritation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Local Irritation The skin of certain individuals may become excessively dry, red, swollen, or blistered. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. If the degree of irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily reduce the amount or frequency of application of the medication, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use all together. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. To help limit skin irritation, patients must i. wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry, and ii. avoid washing the treated skin too often or scrubbing it hard when washing. Patients should apply a topical moisturizer if dryness is bothersome. 5.2 Exposure to Ultraviolet Light or Weather Extremes Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps (UV light) should be avoided or minimized during the use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have extended periods of UV exposure (e.g., due to occupation or sports), or those with inherent sensitivity to the sun, or those using medications that cause photosensitivity, should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products (SPF 15 or higher) and protective clothing over treated areas are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are skin pain, pruritus, skin irritation/subcutaneous irritation, pharyngitis, and erythema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals Private Limited at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Subjects with Acne In separate clinical trials for each concentration, acne subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1% or 0.04%, over the twelve-week period showed that cutaneous irritation scores for erythema, peeling, dryness, burning/stinging, or itching peaked during the initial two weeks of therapy, decreasing thereafter. Approximately half of the subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, had cutaneous irritation at Week 2. Of those subjects who did experience cutaneous side effects, most had signs or symptoms that were mild in severity (severity was ranked on a 4-point ordinal scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). Less than 10% of patients experienced moderate cutaneous irritation and there was no severe irritation at Week 2. In trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, throughout the treatment period the majority of subjects experienced some degree of irritation (mild, moderate, or severe) with 1% (2/225) of subjects having scores indicative of a severe irritation; 1.3% (3/225) of subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere) 0.04%, discontinued treatment due to irritation, which included dryness in one patient and peeling and urticaria in another. In trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, no more than 3% of subjects had cutaneous irritation scores indicative of severe irritation; 6% (14/224) of subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, discontinued treatment due to irritation. Of these 14 subjects, four had severe irritation after 3 to 5 days of treatment, with blistering in one subject. In a double-blind trial with 156 acne subjects comparing 12 weeks of treatment with tretinoin gel (microsphere) 0.04% or 0.1%, (78 subjects each group), the most frequently-reported adverse events affected the skin and subcutaneous tissue (15.4% in the 0.04% group, and 20.5% in the 0.1% group). The most prevalent of the dermatologic adverse events in the 0.04% group was skin irritation (6.4%); and in the 0.1% group skin burning (7.7%), erythema (5.1%), skin irritation (3.8%), and dermatitis (3.8%). Most adverse events were of mild intensity (63.4%), and 34.4% were moderate. One subject in each group had adverse events characterized as severe, neither were dermatologic findings and neither was characterized as related to drug by the investigator. Trials in Subjects without Acne In a half-face comparison trial conducted for up to 14 days in women with sensitive skin, but without acne, tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, was statistically less irritating than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. In addition, a cumulative 21- day irritation evaluation in subjects with normal skin showed that tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, had a lower irritation profile than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. The clinical significance of these irritation studies for patients with acne is not established. Comparable effectiveness of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, and tretinoin cream, 0.1%, has not been established. The lower irritancy of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, in subjects without acne may be attributable to the properties of its vehicle. The contribution of decreased irritancy by the acrylate copolymer microsphere system has not been established. No irritation trials have been performed to compare tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, with either tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, or tretinoin cream, 0.1%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tretinoin gel (microsphere). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant and nursing women. (8.1) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin products. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the MRHD applied topically is defined as 1 gram of tretinoin gel (microsphere)\u201a 0.1%, applied daily to a 60 kg person (0.017 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Pregnant rats were treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 6-15. Alterations were seen in vertebrae and ribs of offspring at 5 to 10 times the MRHD based on the body surface area (BSA) comparison. Pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 7-19. Doses were administered topically for 24 hours a day while wearing Elizabethan collars to prevent ingestion of the drug. Increased incidences of certain alterations, including domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species, were observed at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. Similar malformations were not observed at 0.2 mg/kg/day, 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Other pregnant rabbits exposed topically for six hours per day to 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin while restrained in stocks to prevent ingestion, did not show any malformations at doses up to 19 times (1.0 mg/kg/day) the MRHD based on BSA comparison, but fetal resorptions were increased at 0.5 mg/kg (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Oral tretinoin has been shown to cause malformations in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin induced fetal malformations in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (95 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. In oral peri- and postnatal development studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Nonteratogenic effects on fetus Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered at doses 24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered at doses 10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether tretinoin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin gel (microsphere) is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1% and 0.04%, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08% is a white to very pale yellow opaque gel for topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid, also known as (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1- cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds and a metabolite of naturally occurring Vitamin A. Tretinoin has a molecular weight of 300.44, a molecular formula of C20H28O2 and the following chemical structure: Each gram of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, contains 0.8 mg of tretinoin. The formulation uses acrylate copolymer microsphere system to enable inclusion of the active ingredient, tretinoin, in an aqueous gel. Other components consist of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer 974P, cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol, disodium EDTA, glycerin, PPG-20 methyl glucose ether distearate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, purified water, sorbic acid, and trolamine."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors and/or other mechanisms. The exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown. Current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A metabolism in man. Percutaneous absorption, as determined by the cumulative excretion of radiolabeled drug into urine and feces, was assessed in 44 healthy men and women after single and repeated daily applications of 500 mg of a 0.1% tretinoin gel formulation. Estimates of in vivo bioavailability, mean (SD)%, following both single and multiple daily applications, for a period of 28 days with the 0.1% gel, were 0.82 (0.11)% and 1.41 (0.54)%, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid, all- trans -4-oxo-retinoic acid, and 13- cis -4-oxo-retinoic acid, generally ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL and were essentially unaltered after either single or multiple daily applications of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, relative to baseline levels. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, 0.06% and 0.04%."

In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. These concentrations are near the tretinoin concentration of the 0.04% and 0.1% clinical formulations. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin, respectively. These doses are two and four times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. The components of the microspheres have shown potential for genetic toxicity and fetal malformation. EGDMA, a component of the excipient acrylates copolymer, was positive for induction of structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian cells in the absence of metabolic activation, and negative for genetic toxicity in the Ames assay, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. In oral fertility studies in rats with tretinoin, the no-observable effect level was 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones."

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 mg/kg/day and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin cream applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 weeks to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )."

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin cream may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings . When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin cream should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin cream. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin cream until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin cream may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin cream and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin cream developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin cream or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin cream which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin cream in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN CREAM THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 minutes to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin cream. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN CREAM To get the best results with tretinoin cream therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin cream is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2013 BE PATIENT \u2013 DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin cream once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin cream every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin cream works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin cream work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin cream may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin cream and this usually subsides within 2 weeks to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 WEEKS TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin cream. If tretinoin cream is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 weeks to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinues the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light form a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.1% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.05% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "teratogenic_effects": [
      "Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.025% Acne Treatment For Topical Use Only IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.1% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area).

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.05% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative.

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether.

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.025% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For topical use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area in a thin layer. Areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. A transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging may be noted on application. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or the frequency of application increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily dosing frequencies. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. If tolerated, this should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therapeutic results may be noticed after two weeks, but more than seven weeks of therapy are required before consistent beneficial effects are observed. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, paranasal creases of the nose, and mucous membranes. Patients treated with tretinoin gel microsphere may use cosmetics. Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, products that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, or spices should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Avoid contact with the peel of limes. Particular caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of topical over-the-counter acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin gel (microsphere). It also is advisable to allow the effects of such preparations to subside before use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) is begun. Apply a thin layer of tretinoin gel microsphere once daily, before bedtime, to skin where lesions occur. Keep away from eyes, mouth, nasal creases, and mucous membranes.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should not be used on eczematous or sunburned skin due to potential for severe irritation. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Avoid unprotected exposure to sunlight including sunlamps (UV light), when using tretinoin gel (microsphere) due to potential for increased photosensitization. Use sunscreen of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during exposure. ( 5.2 ) Avoid use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) with weather extremes, such as wind or cold due to potential for increased irritation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Local Irritation The skin of certain individuals may become excessively dry, red, swollen, or blistered. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. If the degree of irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily reduce the amount or frequency of application of the medication, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use all together. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. To help limit skin irritation, patients must i. wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry, and ii. avoid washing the treated skin too often or scrubbing it hard when washing. Patients should apply a topical moisturizer if dryness is bothersome. 5.2 Exposure to Ultraviolet Light or Weather Extremes Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps (UV light) should be avoided or minimized during the use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have extended periods of UV exposure (e.g., due to occupation or sports), or those with inherent sensitivity to the sun, or those using medications that cause photosensitivity, should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products (SPF 15 or higher) and protective clothing over treated areas are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are skin pain, pruritus, skin irritation/subcutaneous irritation, pharyngitis, and erythema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals Private Limited at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Subjects with Acne In separate clinical trials for each concentration, acne subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1% or 0.04%, over the twelve-week period showed that cutaneous irritation scores for erythema, peeling, dryness, burning/stinging, or itching peaked during the initial two weeks of therapy, decreasing thereafter. Approximately half of the subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, had cutaneous irritation at Week 2. Of those subjects who did experience cutaneous side effects, most had signs or symptoms that were mild in severity (severity was ranked on a 4-point ordinal scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). Less than 10% of patients experienced moderate cutaneous irritation and there was no severe irritation at Week 2. In trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, throughout the treatment period the majority of subjects experienced some degree of irritation (mild, moderate, or severe) with 1% (2/225) of subjects having scores indicative of a severe irritation; 1.3% (3/225) of subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere) 0.04%, discontinued treatment due to irritation, which included dryness in one patient and peeling and urticaria in another. In trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, no more than 3% of subjects had cutaneous irritation scores indicative of severe irritation; 6% (14/224) of subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, discontinued treatment due to irritation. Of these 14 subjects, four had severe irritation after 3 to 5 days of treatment, with blistering in one subject. In a double-blind trial with 156 acne subjects comparing 12 weeks of treatment with tretinoin gel (microsphere) 0.04% or 0.1%, (78 subjects each group), the most frequently-reported adverse events affected the skin and subcutaneous tissue (15.4% in the 0.04% group, and 20.5% in the 0.1% group). The most prevalent of the dermatologic adverse events in the 0.04% group was skin irritation (6.4%); and in the 0.1% group skin burning (7.7%), erythema (5.1%), skin irritation (3.8%), and dermatitis (3.8%). Most adverse events were of mild intensity (63.4%), and 34.4% were moderate. One subject in each group had adverse events characterized as severe, neither were dermatologic findings and neither was characterized as related to drug by the investigator. Trials in Subjects without Acne In a half-face comparison trial conducted for up to 14 days in women with sensitive skin, but without acne, tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, was statistically less irritating than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. In addition, a cumulative 21- day irritation evaluation in subjects with normal skin showed that tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, had a lower irritation profile than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. The clinical significance of these irritation studies for patients with acne is not established. Comparable effectiveness of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, and tretinoin cream, 0.1%, has not been established. The lower irritancy of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, in subjects without acne may be attributable to the properties of its vehicle. The contribution of decreased irritancy by the acrylate copolymer microsphere system has not been established. No irritation trials have been performed to compare tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, with either tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, or tretinoin cream, 0.1%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tretinoin gel (microsphere). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant and nursing women. (8.1) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin products. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the MRHD applied topically is defined as 1 gram of tretinoin gel (microsphere)\u201a 0.1%, applied daily to a 60 kg person (0.017 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Pregnant rats were treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 6-15. Alterations were seen in vertebrae and ribs of offspring at 5 to 10 times the MRHD based on the body surface area (BSA) comparison. Pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 7-19. Doses were administered topically for 24 hours a day while wearing Elizabethan collars to prevent ingestion of the drug. Increased incidences of certain alterations, including domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species, were observed at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. Similar malformations were not observed at 0.2 mg/kg/day, 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Other pregnant rabbits exposed topically for six hours per day to 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin while restrained in stocks to prevent ingestion, did not show any malformations at doses up to 19 times (1.0 mg/kg/day) the MRHD based on BSA comparison, but fetal resorptions were increased at 0.5 mg/kg (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Oral tretinoin has been shown to cause malformations in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin induced fetal malformations in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (95 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. In oral peri- and postnatal development studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Nonteratogenic effects on fetus Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered at doses 24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered at doses 10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether tretinoin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin gel (microsphere) is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1% and 0.04%, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08% is a white to very pale yellow opaque gel for topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid, also known as (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1- cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds and a metabolite of naturally occurring Vitamin A. Tretinoin has a molecular weight of 300.44, a molecular formula of C20H28O2 and the following chemical structure: Each gram of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, contains 0.8 mg of tretinoin. The formulation uses acrylate copolymer microsphere system to enable inclusion of the active ingredient, tretinoin, in an aqueous gel. Other components consist of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer 974P, cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol, disodium EDTA, glycerin, PPG-20 methyl glucose ether distearate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, purified water, sorbic acid, and trolamine. str.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors and/or other mechanisms. The exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown. Current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A metabolism in man. Percutaneous absorption, as determined by the cumulative excretion of radiolabeled drug into urine and feces, was assessed in 44 healthy men and women after single and repeated daily applications of 500 mg of a 0.1% tretinoin gel formulation. Estimates of in vivo bioavailability, mean (SD)%, following both single and multiple daily applications, for a period of 28 days with the 0.1% gel, were 0.82 (0.11)% and 1.41 (0.54)%, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid, all- trans -4-oxo-retinoic acid, and 13- cis -4-oxo-retinoic acid, generally ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL and were essentially unaltered after either single or multiple daily applications of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, relative to baseline levels. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, 0.06% and 0.04%."

In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. These concentrations are near the tretinoin concentration of the 0.04% and 0.1% clinical formulations. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin, respectively. These doses are two and four times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. The components of the microspheres have shown potential for genetic toxicity and fetal malformation. EGDMA, a component of the excipient acrylates copolymer, was positive for induction of structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian cells in the absence of metabolic activation, and negative for genetic toxicity in the Ames assay, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

    "general_precautions": [
      "General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

    "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": [
      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (see PRECAUTIONS.)"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream, USP 0.025% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR \u2019 S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing . Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Tretinoin Cream : Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS All questions of a medical nature should be taken up with your doctor. For more information about tretinoin, call Encube Ethicals Pvt. Ltd.at 1-833-285-4151.

Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin.

It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

    "carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility": [
      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied.

Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of over application by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS All questions of a medical nature should be taken up with your doctor. For more information about tretinoin, call our toll-free number: 1-866-634-9120.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposures: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen daily. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of this product. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. When significant diarrhea occurs, Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be avoided during the use of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., a hat) are recommended.

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use for approximating rates. The safety data presented in Table 1 (below) reflects exposure to Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel in 1853 patients with acne vulgaris. Patients were 12 years and older and were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions that were reported in \u22651% of patients treated with Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel were compared to adverse reactions in patients treated with clindamycin phosphate 1.2% in vehicle gel, tretinoin 0.025% in vehicle gel, and the vehicle gel alone: Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 1% of Patients Treated with Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel: 12-Week Studies Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025%Gel N=1853 N (%) Clindamycin N=1428 N (%) Tretinoin N=846 N (%) Vehicle N=423 N (%) PATIENTS WITH AT LEAST ONE AR 497 (27) 342 (24) 225 (27) 91 (22) Nasopharyngitis 65 (4) 64 (5) 16 (2) 5 (1) Pharyngolaryngeal pain 29 (2) 18 (1) 5 (1) 7 (2) Dry skin 23 (1) 7 (1) 3 (<1) 0 (0) Cough 19 (1) 21 (2) 9 (1) 2 (1) Sinusitis 19 (1) 19 (1) 15 (2) 4 (1) NOTE: Formulations used in all treatment arms were in the Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% vehicle gel.

Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel was tested for maternal and developmental toxicity in New Zealand White Rabbits with topical doses of 60, 180 and 600 mg/kg/day. Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison) was considered to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and developmental toxicity following dermal administration of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel for 2 weeks prior to artificial insemination and continuing until gestation day 18, inclusive. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel applied daily to a 60 kg person. Clindamycin Teratology (Segment II) studies using clindamycin were performed orally in rats (up to 600 mg/kg/day) and mice (up to 100 mg/kg/day) (583 and 49 times amount of clindamycin in the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively) or with subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 180 mg/kg/day (175 and 88 times the amount of clindamycin in the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Tretinoin In oral Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (~78 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 40 times the recommended human clinical dose based on body surface area comparison. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 78 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin [See Microbiology (12.4) .] Tretinoin Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In an open-label, multiple-dose study treating 12 subjects with moderate to severe acne, the percutaneous absorption of tretinoin following 14 consecutive daily applications of approximately 4 g of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel was minimal. Quantifiable tretinoin plasma concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 ng/mL, with unquantifiable plasma concentrations in 50% to 92% of subjects at any given timepoint following administration. The plasma concentrations of the key tretinoin metabolites, 13-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid, ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 ng/mL and from 1.6 to 6.5 ng/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations for clindamycin generally did not exceed 3.5 ng/mL, with the exception of one subject whose plasma concentration reached 13.1 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis. Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes was not examined in clinical trials with Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel. P. acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented. Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin."

No significant increase in tumors was noted in the treated animals. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended human topical clinical dose is defined as 1 g of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel applied daily to a 60 kg person. Fertility (Segment 1) studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day of clindamycin (approximately 290 times the amount of clindamycin delivered from the recommended clinical dose for Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel, based on body surface area comparison) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Tretinoin In two independent studies with long-term topical application of tretinoin in mice, carcinogenicity was not observed. In both studies, tretinoin was administered topically (0.025% or 0.1%) three times per week for up to 2 years. No carcinogenicity was observed with maximum effects of dermal amyloidosis in the basal layer of the skin. Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photo co-carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies, employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to the drug and UV radiation. The contribution of clindamycin to that effect is unknown. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both tests were negative. In oral Segment 1 studies in rats treated with tretinoin, the no-observed-effect-level was 2 mg/kg/day (~78 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel for treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in three 12-week prospective, multi-center, randomized, blinded studies in patients 12 years and older. Studies 1 and 2 were of identical design, and compared Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel to clindamycin in the vehicle gel, tretinoin in the vehicle gel, and the vehicle gel alone. Patients with mild, moderate, or severe acne were enrolled in the studies. The co-primary efficacy variables were: 1. Mean percent change from baseline at Week 12 in 1. inflammatory lesion counts, 2. non-inflammatory lesion counts, and 3. total lesion counts 2. Percent of subjects who cleared or almost cleared at Week 12 as judged by an Evaluator\u2019s Global Severity (EGS) score. The EGS scoring scale used in all of the clinical trials for Clindamycin Phosphate 1.2% and Tretinoin 0.025% Gel is as follows: Grade Description Clear Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris Almost Clear Rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red) Mild Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions) Moderate Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one small nodulo-cystic lesion Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulocystic lesions Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate, variable number of comedones, many papules/pustules and many nodulocystic lesions In Study 1, a total of 1252 patients were enrolled, and in Study 2, a total of 1288 patients were enrolled. The combined results are presented in Table 3.

As with Studies 1 and 2, the co-primary endpoints were mean percent reduction in lesion counts (inflammatory, non-inflammatory and total) and the EGS score. In Study 3, success on the EGS score was assessed by the percentage of subjects who had at least 2 grades of improvement from Baseline to Week 12.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% RETIN-A applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with RETIN-A has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of RETIN-A. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of RETIN-A did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS)."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS TRETINOIN CREAM For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with Tretinoin Cream may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with Tretinoin Cream should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using Tretinoin Cream. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with Tretinoin Cream until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with Tretinoin Cream may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of Tretinoin Cream and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with Tretinoin Cream developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to Tretinoin Cream or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with Tretinoin Cream which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of Tretinoin Cream in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN CREAM THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying Tretinoin Cream. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN CREAM To get the best results with Tretinoin Cream therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when Tretinoin Cream is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2013 BE PATIENT \u2013 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply Tretinoin Cream once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying Tretinoin Cream every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION;it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin Cream works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make Tretinoin Cream work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of Tretinoin Cream may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to Tretinoin Cream and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using Tretinoin Cream. If Tretinoin Cream is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, edematous, blistered, or crusted. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the medication should be adjusted to a level the patient can tolerate. True contact allergy to topical tretinoin is rarely encountered. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin. Some individuals have been reported to have heightened susceptibility to sunlight while under treatment with tretinoin. To date, all adverse effects of tretinoin have been reversible upon discontinuance of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see PRECAUTIONS )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.1% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposures: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen daily. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of this product. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. When significant diarrhea occurs, clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be avoided during the use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., a hat) are recommended. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was tested for maternal and developmental toxicity in New Zealand White Rabbits with topical doses of 60, 180 and 600 mg/kg/day. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison) was considered to be the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and developmental toxicity following dermal administration of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel for two weeks prior to artificial insemination and continuing until gestation day 18, inclusive. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel applied daily to a 60 kg person. Clindamycin Teratology (Segment II) studies using clindamycin were performed orally in rats (up to 600 mg/kg/day) and mice (up to 100 mg/kg/day) (583 and 49 times amount of clindamycin in the recommended clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison, respectively) or with subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 180 mg/kg/day (175 and 88 times the amount of clindamycin in the recommended clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Tretinoin In oral Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (~ 78 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 40 times the recommended human clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 78 times the recommended clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. Clinical trials of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel included patients 12 to 17 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14) ] 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanisms of Action Clindamycin [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. Tretinoin Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In an open-label, multiple-dose study treating 12 subjects with moderate to severe acne, the percutaneous absorption of tretinoin following 14 consecutive daily applications of approximately 4 g of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was minimal. Quantifiable tretinoin plasma concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 1.6 ng/mL, with unquantifiable plasma concentrations in 50% to 92% of subjects at any given timepoint following administration. The plasma concentrations of the key tretinoin metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid, ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 ng/mL and from 1.6 to 6.5 ng/mL, respectively. Plasma concentrations for clindamycin generally did not exceed 3.5 ng/mL, with the exception of one subject whose plasma concentration reached 13.1 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis. Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes was not examined in clinical trials with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. P acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented. Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and impairment of fertility testing of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel have not been performed in any species. Clindamycin The carcinogenicity of a 1% clindamycin phosphate gel similar to clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was evaluated by daily application to mice for two years. The daily doses used in this study were approximately 13 and 72 times higher than the human dose of clindamycin phosphate from clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, assuming complete absorption and based on a body surface area comparison. No significant increase in tumors was noted in the treated animals. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended human topical clinical dose is defined as 1 g of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel applied daily to a 60 kg person. Fertility (Segment 1) studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day of clindamycin (approximately 290 times the amount of clindamycin delivered from the recommended clinical dose for clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, based on a body surface area comparison) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Tretinoin In two independent studies with long-term topical application of tretinoin in mice, carcinogenicity was not observed. In both studies, tretinoin was administered topically (0.025% or 0.1%) three times per week for up to two years. No carcinogenicity was observed with maximum effects of dermal amyloidosis in the basal layer of the skin. Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photoco-carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies, employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to the drug and UV radiation. The contribution of clindamycin to that effect is unknown. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both tests were negative. In oral Segment 1 studies in rats treated with tretinoin, the no-observed-effect-level was 2 mg/kg/day (~78 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel for treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in three 12-week prospective, multi-center, randomized, blinded studies in patients 12 years and older. Studies 1 and 2 were of identical design, and compared clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel to clindamycin in the vehicle gel, tretinoin in the vehicle gel, and the vehicle gel alone. Patients with mild, moderate, or severe acne were enrolled in the studies. The co-primary efficacy variables were: (1) Mean percent change from baseline at Week 12 in inflammatory lesion counts, non-inflammatory lesion counts, and total lesion counts (2) Percent of subjects who cleared or almost cleared at Week 12 as judged by an Evaluator\u2019s Global Severity (EGS) score. The EGS scoring scale used in all of the clinical trials for clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is as follows: Grade Description Clear Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris Almost Clear Rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red) Mild Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only; no nodulocystic lesions) Moderate Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident: several to many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be one small nodulo-cystic lesion Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulocystic lesions Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate, variable number of comedones, many papules/pustules and many nodulocystic lesions In Study 1, a total of 1,252 patients were enrolled, and in Study 2, a total of 1,288 patients were enrolled.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion: tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on morphological diagnosis of APL. Confirm diagnosis by detection of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion. ( 5.3 ) Leukocytosis: Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension: Tretinoin capsules has been associated with benign intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. ( 5.5 ) Lipid Abnormalities: Patients experienced hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which may be reversible upon completion of treatment. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function test results at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. ( 5.7 ) Thromboembolic Events: Venous and arterial events have been reported; these events may occur during the first month of treatment with tretinoin capsules. ( 5.8 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use 2 effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.2 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation Syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in about 26% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic hypotension and it has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. This syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, as early as following the first dose. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in some cases due to progressive hypoxemia and several patients have died with multi-organ failure. At the first signs or symptoms of this syndrome, immediately administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules for moderate and severe differentiation syndrome until resolution [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on the morphological diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Confirm the diagnosis of APL by detection of the t(15;17) translocation using cytogenetic studies or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion using molecular diagnostic techniques. Tretinoin capsules not recommended for use in patients without these genetic markers [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . 5.4 Leukocytosis Rapidly evolving leukocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occurred in about 40% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients who present with a baseline white blood cell count (WBC) > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L have an increased risk. Patients who receive chemotherapy with tretinoin capsules may be at a reduced risk. Rapidly evolving leukocytosis is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening complications. Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Retinoids, including tretinoin capsules, have been associated with intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Evaluate patients with these symptoms for intracranial hypertension, and, if present, institute appropriate care in concert with neurological assessment. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. The concomitant use of other products (e.g., tetracyclines) that can cause intracranial hypertension may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.6 Lipid Abnormalities Hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia has occurred in up to 60% of patients who received tretinoin capsules. These changes may be reversible upon completion of treatment. The clinical consequences of increased triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Elevated liver function test results occurred in 50% to 60% of patients during treatment with tretinoin capsules. Most of these abnormalities resolved without interruption of tretinoin capsules or after completion of treatment. Monitor liver function test at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules if liver function test results increase to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal values until resolution. 5.8 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction and renal infarct have been reported with tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. These events may occur during the first month of treatment. Patients taking anti-fibrinolytic agents may have an increased risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] .",
      "5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use 2 effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] .",
      "5.2 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation Syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in about 26% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic hypotension and it has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. This syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, as early as following the first dose. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in some cases due to progressive hypoxemia and several patients have died with multi-organ failure. At the first signs or symptoms of this syndrome, immediately administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules for moderate and severe differentiation syndrome until resolution [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] .",
      "5.3 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on the morphological diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Confirm the diagnosis of APL by detection of the t(15;17) translocation using cytogenetic studies or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion using molecular diagnostic techniques. Tretinoin capsules not recommended for use in patients without these genetic markers [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] .",
      "5.4 Leukocytosis Rapidly evolving leukocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occurred in about 40% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients who present with a baseline white blood cell count (WBC) > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L have an increased risk. Patients who receive chemotherapy with tretinoin capsules may be at a reduced risk. Rapidly evolving leukocytosis is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening complications. Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated.",
      "5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Retinoids, including tretinoin capsules, have been associated with intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Evaluate patients with these symptoms for intracranial hypertension, and, if present, institute appropriate care in concert with neurological assessment. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. The concomitant use of other products (e.g., tetracyclines) that can cause intracranial hypertension may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] .",
      "5.6 Lipid Abnormalities Hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia has occurred in up to 60% of patients who received tretinoin capsules. These changes may be reversible upon completion of treatment. The clinical consequences of increased triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment.",
      "5.8 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction and renal infarct have been reported with tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. These events may occur during the first month of treatment. Patients taking anti-fibrinolytic agents may have an increased risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )], tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Trentoin capsules are a retinoid and increased spontaneous abortions and major fetal abnormalities related to the use of retinoids have been documented in humans. Reported malformations include abnormalities of the central nervous system, musculoskeletal system, external ear, eye, thymus and great vessels; and facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and parathyroid hormone deficiency. Some of these abnormalities were fatal. IQ scores less than 85, with or without obvious CNS abnormalities, have been reported in pediatrics exposed to retinoids in utero . Animal Data Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of tretinoin in human milk, the effects on the breastfeed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from tretinoin capsules in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfed during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Use in Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating tretinoin capsules. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to initiating tretinoin capsules with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to abstain continuously from sexual intercourse or to use two effective methods of contraception. Counsel patients to use two effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month after the last dose. Two methods of effective contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Refer females of reproductive potential to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on testicular toxicities observed in dogs, tretinoin capsules may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The reversibility of effect on fertility is unknown. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The maximum tolerated dose is lower in pediatric patients compared to adults. Some pediatric patients experience severe headache and intracranial hypertension, which required management with an analgesic and a lumbar puncture. Dose reduction may be considered for pediatric patients experiencing serious and/or intolerable adverse reactions. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Across clinical studies of tretinoin capsules, 21% were 60 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients."

Animal Data Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo . In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have not been characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of tretinoin capsules 22.5 mg/m 2 orally twice daily, the mean \u00b1 SD peak tretinoin concentrations after the first dose was 394 \u00b1 89 and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 138 \u00b1 139 ng/mL, while area under the curve (AUC) after the first dose was 537 \u00b1 191 ng\u00b7h/mL and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 249 \u00b1 185 ng\u00b7h/mL. Absorption Time to reach peak concentration was between 1 and 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of tretinoin capsules was approximately 50%. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of tretinoin capsules has not been characterized. Food increases the absorption of retinoids, as a class. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of tretinoin has not been determined. Protein binding is greater than 95%, predominately to albumin. Plasma protein binding remains constant over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of tretinoin following initial dosing is 0.5 to 2 hours in patients with APL. Metabolism Tretinoin induced its own metabolism with plasma concentrations after 1 week of continuous therapy decreased to one-third of their day 1 values. Tretinoin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2E and undergoes glucuronidation by UGT2B7. Metabolites include 9- cis retinoic acid, 13- cis retinoic acid, 4-oxo trans retinoic acid, 4-oxo cis retinoic acid, and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide. The metabolites 4-oxo retinoic acid and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide have one-third of the pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Excretion Following administration of radiolabeled tretinoin 2.75 mg and 50 mg (0.53 to 9.6 times the approved recommended dosage based on 1.7 m 2 ), approximately 63% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 72 hours and 31% appeared in the feces within 6 days. Specific Populations The effect of age, sex, race, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tretinoin is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Coadministration of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased tretinoin AUC by 72%.

In a carcinogenicity study, female B5D2F1 mice pretreated with a carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN, intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) received dietary supplement of all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) for 12 months. Tretinoin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the diet (about 2 times the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) was shown to increase the rate of DEN-induced mouse hepatocellular carcinomas. Tretinoin in combination with 50 mg/kg of DEN also increased the incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Tretinoin was negative when tested in the Ames and Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT assays for mutagenicity. A 2-fold increase in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been demonstrated in human diploid fibroblasts, but other chromosome aberration assays, including an in vitro assay in human peripheral lymphocytes and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, did not show a clastogenic or aneuploidogenic effect. Adverse effects on fertility and reproductive performance were not observed in studies conducted in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 2/3 the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In a 6-week toxicology study in dogs, testicular degeneration, with increased numbers of immature spermatozoa, were observed at 10 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the equivalent human dose in mg/m 2 )."

      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.025% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions: General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed.

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion: Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on morphological diagnosis of APL. Confirm diagnosis by detection of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion. ( 5.3 ) Leukocytosis: Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) Intracranial Hypertension: Tretinoin capsules have been associated with benign intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. ( 5.5 ) Lipid Abnormalities: Patients experienced hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which may be reversible upon completion of treatment. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. ( 5.6 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function test results at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. ( 5.7 ) Thromboembolic Events: Venous and arterial events have been reported; these events may occur during the first month of treatment with tretinoin capsules. ( 5.8 , 7.4 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use 2 effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5.2 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation Syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in about 26% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic hypotension and it has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. This syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, as early as following the first dose. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in some cases due to progressive hypoxemia and several patients have died with multi-organ failure. At the first signs or symptoms of this syndrome, immediately administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules for moderate and severe differentiation syndrome until resolution [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5.3 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on the morphological diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Confirm the diagnosis of APL by detection of the t(15;17) translocation using cytogenetic studies or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion using molecular diagnostic techniques. Tretinoin capsules are not recommended for use in patients without these genetic markers [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . 5.4 Leukocytosis Rapidly evolving leukocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occurred in about 40% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Patients who present with a baseline white blood cell count (WBC) > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L have an increased risk. Patients who receive chemotherapy with tretinoin capsules may be at a reduced risk. Rapidly evolving leukocytosis is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening complications. Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Retinoids, including tretinoin capsules, have been associated with intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Evaluate patients with these symptoms for intracranial hypertension, and, if present, institute appropriate care in concert with neurological assessment. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. The concomitant use of other products (e.g., tetracyclines) that can cause intracranial hypertension may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] . 5.6 Lipid Abnormalities Hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia has occurred in up to 60% of patients who received tretinoin capsules. These changes may be reversible upon completion of treatment. The clinical consequences of increased triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Elevated liver function test results occurred in 50% to 60% of patients during treatment with tretinoin capsules. Most of these abnormalities resolved without interruption of tretinoin capsules or after completion of treatment. Monitor liver function test at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules if liver function test results increase to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal values until resolution. 5.8 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction and renal infarct have been reported with tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. These events may occur during the first month of treatment. Patients taking anti-fibrinolytic agents may have an increased risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] .",

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant Use of Products Known to Cause Intracranial Hypertension : Avoid concomitant use with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension. ( 7.2 ) Vitamin A : Avoid concomitant use with vitamin A. ( 7.3 ) Anti-fibrinolytic Agents : Avoid concomitant use with anti-fibrinolytic agents. ( 7.4 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Tretinoin Capsules Strong or moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with strong CYP3A inhibitors if possible and monitor more frequently if concomitant use is unavoidable. Monitor patients taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors concomitantly with tretinoin capsules more frequently for adverse reactions. Tretinoin is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases tretinoin plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .

( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )], tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and increased spontaneous abortions and major fetal abnormalities related to the use of retinoids have been documented in humans. Reported malformations include abnormalities of the central nervous system, musculoskeletal system, external ear, eye, thymus and great vessels; and facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and parathyroid hormone deficiency. Some of these abnormalities were fatal. IQ scores less than 85, with or without obvious CNS abnormalities, have been reported in pediatrics exposed to retinoids in utero . Animal Data Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of tretinoin in human milk, the effects on the breastfeed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from tretinoin capsules in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfed during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Use in Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating tretinoin capsules. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to initiating tretinoin capsules with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to abstain continuously from sexual intercourse or to use two effective methods of contraception. Counsel patients to use two effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month after the last dose. Two methods of effective contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Refer females of reproductive potential to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on testicular toxicities observed in dogs, tretinoin capsules may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . The reversibility of effect on fertility is unknown. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The maximum tolerated dose is lower in pediatric patients compared to adults. Some pediatric patients experience severe headache and intracranial hypertension, which required management with an analgesic and a lumbar puncture. Dose reduction may be considered for pediatric patients experiencing serious and/or intolerable adverse reactions. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Across clinical studies of tretinoin capsules, 21% were 60 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo . In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have not been characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of tretinoin capsules 22.5 mg/m 2 orally twice daily, the mean \u00b1 SD peak tretinoin concentrations after the first dose was 394 \u00b1 89 and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 138 \u00b1 139 ng/mL, while area under the curve (AUC) after the first dose was 537 \u00b1 191 ng\u00b7h/mL and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 249 \u00b1 185 ng\u00b7h/mL. Absorption Time to reach peak concentration was between 1 and 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of tretinoin capsules was approximately 50%. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of tretinoin capsules has not been characterized. Food increases the absorption of retinoids, as a class. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of tretinoin has not been determined. Protein binding is greater than 95%, predominately to albumin. Plasma protein binding remains constant over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of tretinoin following initial dosing is 0.5 to 2 hours in patients with APL. Metabolism Tretinoin induced its own metabolism with plasma concentrations after 1 week of continuous therapy decreased to one-third of their day 1 values. Tretinoin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2E and undergoes glucuronidation by UGT2B7. Metabolites include 9- cis retinoic acid, 13- cis retinoic acid, 4-oxo trans retinoic acid, 4-oxo cis retinoic acid, and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide. The metabolites 4-oxo retinoic acid and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide have one-third of the pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Excretion Following administration of radiolabeled tretinoin 2.75 mg and 50 mg (0.53 to 9.6 times the approved recommended dosage based on 1.7 m 2 ), approximately 63% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 72 hours and 31% appeared in the feces within 6 days. Specific Populations The effect of age, sex, race, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tretinoin is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Post Marketing Experience Strong CYP3A inhibitors: Tretinoin AUC increased by 72% following concomitant use with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor). Increased tretinoin toxicity has also been reported post-marketing with strong CYP3A inhibitors including certain antimycotics. Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Increased tretinoin toxicity following concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with certain antimycotics that are moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors has been reported post-marketing.

Tretinoin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the diet (about 2 times the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) was shown to increase the rate of DEN-induced mouse hepatocellular carcinomas. Tretinoin in combination with 50 mg/kg of DEN also increased the incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Tretinoin was negative when tested in the Ames and Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT assays for mutagenicity. A 2-fold increase in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been demonstrated in human diploid fibroblasts, but other chromosome aberration assays, including an in vitro assay in human peripheral lymphocytes and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, did not show a clastogenic or aneuploidogenic effect.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light form a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.1% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "Description Tretinoin Cream and Tretinoin Gel are used for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Tretinoin Gel contains tretinoin (retinoic acid, vitamin A acid) in either of two strengths, 0.025% or 0.01% by weight, in a gel vehicle of butylated hydroxytoluene, hydroxypropyl cellulose and alcohol (denatured with tert -butyl alcohol and brucine sulfate) 90% w/w. Tretinoin Cream contains tretinoin in one of three strengths, 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.025% by weight, in a hydrophilic cream vehicle of stearic acid, isopropyl myristate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum, sorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, and purified water. Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans -retinoic acid and has the following structure:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones."

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. GELS ARE FLAMMABLE.

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream or Tretinoin Gel should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of overapplication by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )."

THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream and Gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so , you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to Tretinoin and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion: tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on morphological diagnosis of APL. Confirm diagnosis by detection of the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion. (5.3) Leukocytosis: Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. (5.4) Intracranial Hypertension: Tretinoin capsules has been associated with benign intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. (5.5) Lipid Abnormalities: Patients experienced hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which may be reversible upon completion of treatment. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. (5.6) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function test results at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. (5.7) Thromboembolic Events: Venous and arterial events have been reported; these events may occur during the first month of treatment with tretinoin capsules. (5.8 , 7.4) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use 2 effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month following the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] . 5.2 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation Syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in about 26% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, radiographic pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusions, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multi-organ failure. This syndrome has been accompanied by impaired myocardial contractility and episodic hypotension and it has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. This syndrome generally occurs during the first month of treatment, as early as following the first dose. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required in some cases due to progressive hypoxemia and several patients have died with multi-organ failure. At the first signs or symptoms of this syndrome, immediately administer dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours until signs and symptoms have abated for at least 3 days and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules for moderate and severe differentiation syndrome until resolution [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Patients Without t(15;17) Translocation or PML/RAR\u03b1 Fusion Tretinoin capsules may be initiated based on the morphological diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Confirm the diagnosis of APL by detection of the t(15;17) translocation using cytogenetic studies or PML/RAR\u03b1 fusion using molecular diagnostic techniques. Tretinoin capsules not recommended for use in patients without these genetic markers [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . 5.4 Leukocytosis Rapidly evolving leukocytosis, which can be life-threatening, occurred in about 40% of patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Patients who present with a baseline white blood cell count (WBC) > 5 \u00d7 10 9 /L have an increased risk. Patients who receive chemotherapy with tretinoin capsules may be at a reduced risk. Rapidly evolving leukocytosis is associated with a higher risk of life-threatening complications. Consider administering cytoreductive chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated or hydroxyurea) with tretinoin capsules in the setting of leukocytosis, as clinically indicated. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Retinoids, including tretinoin capsules, have been associated with intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients. Early signs and symptoms include papilledema, headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. Evaluate patients with these symptoms for intracranial hypertension, and, if present, institute appropriate care in concert with neurological assessment. Consider interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of tretinoin capsules as appropriate. The concomitant use of other products (e.g., tetracyclines) that can cause intracranial hypertension may increase the risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules with other products that can cause intracranial hypertension [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . 5.6 Lipid Abnormalities Hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia has occurred in up to 60% of patients who received tretinoin capsules. These changes may be reversible upon completion of treatment. The clinical consequences of increased triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications. Monitor fasting triglycerides and cholesterol at baseline and periodically during treatment. 5.7 Hepatotoxicity Elevated liver function test results occurred in 50% to 60% of patients during treatment with tretinoin capsules. Most of these abnormalities resolved without interruption of tretinoin capsules or after completion of treatment. Monitor liver function test at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Consider withholding tretinoin capsules if liver function test results increase to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal values until resolution. 5.8 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction and renal infarct have been reported with tretinoin capsules [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. These events may occur during the first month of treatment. Patients taking anti-fibrinolytic agents may have an increased risk. Avoid concomitant use of tretinoin capsules and anti-fibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid or aprotinin [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] .",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman. Tretinoin capsules are a retinoid and there is an increased risk of major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions and premature births following exposure to retinoids during pregnancy in humans. Tretinoin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits and pigtail monkeys at doses less than the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Trentoin capsules are a retinoid and increased spontaneous abortions and major fetal abnormalities related to the use of retinoids have been documented in humans. Reported malformations include abnormalities of the central nervous system, musculoskeletal system, external ear, eye, thymus and great vessels; and facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and parathyroid hormone deficiency. Some of these abnormalities were fatal. IQ scores less than 85, with or without obvious CNS abnormalities, have been reported in pediatrics exposed to retinoids in utero . Animal Data Tretinoin causes fetal resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses in all animals studied. Gross external, soft tissue and skeletal alterations occurred at doses higher than 0.7 mg/kg/day in mice, 2 mg/kg/day in rats, 7 mg/kg/day in hamsters, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, the only dose tested, in pigtail monkeys (about 1/20, 1/4, and 1/2 and 4 times the human dose, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of tretinoin in human milk, the effects on the breastfeed child or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from tretinoin capsules in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfed during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Use in Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Tretinoin capsules can cause embryo-fetal loss and malformations when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating tretinoin capsules. Females of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week prior to initiating tretinoin capsules with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to abstain continuously from sexual intercourse or to use two effective methods of contraception. Counsel patients to use two effective methods of contraception during treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 month after the last dose. Two methods of effective contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy. Refer females of reproductive potential to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with tretinoin capsules and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on testicular toxicities observed in dogs, tretinoin capsules may impair male fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . The reversibility of effect on fertility is unknown. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have been established in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling. The maximum tolerated dose is lower in pediatric patients compared to adults. Some pediatric patients experience severe headache and intracranial hypertension, which required management with an analgesic and a lumbar puncture. Dose reduction may be considered for pediatric patients experiencing serious and/or intolerable adverse reactions. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Across clinical studies of tretinoin capsules, 21% were 60 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdose with tretinoin capsules, reversible signs of hypervitaminosis A (headache, nausea, vomiting, mucocutaneous symptoms) can appear. Overdosage with other retinoids has been associated with transient headache, facial flushing, cheilosis, abdominal pain, dizziness and ataxia. These symptoms have quickly resolved without apparent residual effects. There is no specific treatment in the case of an overdose; however, it is important that the patient be treated in a special hematological unit."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo . In APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of tretinoin capsules have not been characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following the administration of tretinoin capsules 22.5 mg/m 2 orally twice daily, the mean \u00b1 SD peak tretinoin concentrations after the first dose was 394 \u00b1 89 and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 138 \u00b1 139 ng/mL, while area under the curve (AUC) after the first dose was 537 \u00b1 191 ng\u00b7h/mL and after 1 week of continuous treatment was 249 \u00b1 185 ng\u00b7h/mL. Absorption Time to reach peak concentration was between 1 and 2 hours. The absolute bioavailability of tretinoin capsules was approximately 50%. Effect of Food The effect of food on the absorption of tretinoin capsules has not been characterized. Food increases the absorption of retinoids, as a class. Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of tretinoin has not been determined. Protein binding is greater than 95%, predominately to albumin. Plasma protein binding remains constant over the concentration range of 10 to 500 ng/mL. Elimination The terminal elimination half-life of tretinoin following initial dosing is 0.5 to 2 hours in patients with APL. Metabolism Tretinoin induced its own metabolism with plasma concentrations after 1 week of continuous therapy decreased to one-third of their day 1 values. Tretinoin is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2E and undergoes glucuronidation by UGT2B7. Metabolites include 9- cis retinoic acid, 13- cis retinoic acid, 4-oxo trans retinoic acid, 4-oxo cis retinoic acid, and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide. The metabolites 4-oxo retinoic acid and 4-oxo trans retinoic acid glucuronide have one-third of the pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Excretion Following administration of radiolabeled tretinoin 2.75 mg and 50 mg (0.53 to 9.6 times the approved recommended dosage based on 1.7 m 2 ), approximately 63% of radioactivity was recovered in the urine within 72 hours and 31% appeared in the feces within 6 days. Specific Populations The effect of age, sex, race, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tretinoin is unknown. Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Coadministration of ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased tretinoin AUC by 72%. In Vitro Studies Effect of Tretinoin on Transporters: Tretinoin does not inhibit P-gp and BCRP in vitro ."

In a carcinogenicity study, female B5D2F1 mice pretreated with a carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN, intraperitoneal 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) received dietary supplement of all-trans-retinoic acid (tretinoin) for 12 months. Tretinoin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day in the diet (about 2 times the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) was shown to increase the rate of DEN-induced mouse hepatocellular carcinomas. Tretinoin in combination with 50 mg/kg of DEN also increased the incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. Tretinoin was negative when tested in the Ames and Chinese hamster V79 cell HGPRT assays for mutagenicity. A 2-fold increase in the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) has been demonstrated in human diploid fibroblasts, but other chromosome aberration assays, including an in vitro assay in human peripheral lymphocytes and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, did not show a clastogenic or aneuploidogenic effect. Adverse effects on fertility and reproductive performance were not observed in studies conducted in rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 2/3 the human dose on a mg/m 2 basis). In a 6-week toxicology study in dogs, testicular degeneration, with increased numbers of immature spermatozoa, were observed at 10 mg/kg/day (about 4 times the equivalent human dose in mg/m 2 )."

Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. Pharmacokinetics: In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies with tretinoin cream indicate that less than 0.3% of the topically applied dose is bioavailable. Circulating plasma levels of both tretinoin and isotretinoin are only slightly elevated above those found in healthy normal controls."

      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps or artificial sunlight, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, the paranasal creases, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Information for Patients See attached Patient Package Insert . Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin cream. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin cream is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a life-time dermal study in CD-1 mice with another tretinoin cream, at 100 and 200 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose, a few skin tumors in the female mice and liver tumors in male mice were observed. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when tretinoin was administered topically at a dose five times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the \u201crecommended human topical clinical dose\u201d is defined as 1.0 g of 0.025% Tretinoin Cream applied daily to a 50 kg person. In a chronic, two-year bioassay of vitamin A acid in mice performed by Tsubura and Yamamoto, generalized amyloid deposition was reported in all vitamin A treated groups in the basal layer of the skin. In CD-1 mice, a similar study reported hyalinization at the treated skin sites and the incidence of this finding was 0/50, 3/50, 3/50, and 2/50 in male mice and 1/50, 0/50, 4/50, and 2/50 in female mice from the vehicle control, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively. Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. In other studies, when lightly pigmented hairless mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to carcinogenic doses of UVA/UVB light, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors were either reduced or no effect was seen. Due to significantly different experimental conditions, no strict comparison of these disparate data is possible at this time. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. Dermal Segment I and III studies with tretinoin cream have not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (> 400 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats when given orally in doses 1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increased embryolethality and abortion were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%; os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported in rats when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied. Topical tretinoin (Tretinoin Cream, 0.1%) has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when given in doses 91 times the topical human dose for cream (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.1% cream topically). In this study, increased incidence of cleft palate and hydrocephaly was reported in the tretinoin-treated animals. There are other reports, in New Zealand White rabbits with doses of approximately 80 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. When given subcutaneously to rabbits, tretinoin was teratogenic at 2 mg/kg/day but not at 1 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 400 and 200 times, respectively, the human topical dose of tretinoin cream, 0.025% (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.025% cream topically). In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin was not teratogenic at doses of 100 and 200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, in rats and rabbits, respectively. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A). Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 100 times the recommended topical human clinical dose. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 500 times the recommended topical human clinical dose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% should not be used during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin cream is administered to a nursing woman."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transient feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once-daily dosing frequencies. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent increase in number and exacerbation of inflammatory acne lesions may occur. This is due, in part, to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Patients treated with tretinoin cream may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS section)."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS TRETINOIN CREAM USP, 0.025% Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN CREAM ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin: As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin cream may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings: When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors were reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun: When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin cream should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps or artificial sunlight while you are using Tretinoin Cream, 0.025%. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin cream until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold: Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin cream may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems: The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered, or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin cream and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin cream developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. Use other medication only on your physician\u2019s advice: Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos, and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin cream which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin cream in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying Tretinoin Cream, 0.025%. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN CREAM To get the best results with tretinoin cream therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin cream is used properly, many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, in the evening, or as directed by your physician, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication, and won\u2019t give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have had some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin, and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. If needed, you may apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) in the morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin cream work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin cream may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin cream and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage, it is important to continue using tretinoin cream. If tretinoin cream is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice an improvement in your appearance by 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control, you should continue regular application of tretinoin cream until your physician instructs otherwise. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Distributed by: Actavis Pharma, Inc. Parsippany, NJ 07054 USA Revised - November 2019"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin gel, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin gel acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin gel. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin gel is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin gel applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin gel has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin gel. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin gel is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of overapplication by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin gel acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (see PRECAUTIONS. )"

THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin . As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin gel may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun . When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin gel should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin gel. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin gel until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin gel may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin gel and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin gel developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin gel or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin gel which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin gel in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN GEL THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin gel. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN GEL To get the best results with tretinoin gel therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin gel is used properly, many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin gel once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin gel every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin gel works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin gel work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin gel may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin gel and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin gel. If tretinoin gel is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin gel until your physician instructs otherwise. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS All questions of a medical nature should be taken up with your doctor. For more information about tretinoin gel, call Encube Ethicals Pvt. Ltd.at 1-833-285-4151.

      "Description Tretinoin Cream and Tretinoin Gel are used for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Tretinoin Gel contains tretinoin (retinoic acid, vitamin A acid) in either of two strengths, 0.025% or 0.01% by weight, in a gel vehicle of butylated hydroxytoluene, hydroxypropyl cellulose and alcohol (denatured with tert -butyl alcohol and brucine sulfate) 90% w/w. Tretinoin Cream contains tretinoin in one of three strengths, 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.025% by weight, in a hydrophilic cream vehicle of stearic acid, isopropyl myristate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum, sorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, and purified water. Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans -retinoic acid and has the following structure: formula"

      "Clinical Pharmacology Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones."

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. Note: Keep away from heat and flame. Keep tube tightly closed."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin Cream or Tretinoin Gel should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of overapplication by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS TRETINOIN CREAM TRETINOIN GEL Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using Cream \u2022 Gel For Topical Use Only THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream and Gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so , you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with Tretinoin Gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to Tretinoin and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS All questions of a medical nature should be taken up with your doctor. For more information about tretinoin, call Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX).

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. ( 5.1 ) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Colitis Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be discontinued. Severe colitis has occurred following oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death. Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be avoided during the use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Daily use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., a hat) are recommended. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel."

There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. A limit teratology study performed in Sprague Dawley rats treated topically with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel or 0.025% tretinoin gel at a dose of 2 mL/kg during gestation days 6 to 15 did not result in teratogenic effects. Although no systemic levels of tretinoin were detected, craniofacial and heart abnormalities were described in drug-treated groups. These abnormalities are consistent with retinoid effects and occurred at 16 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure, the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel applied daily to a 50-kg person. Clindamycin: Reproductive developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (480 and 240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 180 mg/kg/day (140 and 70 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Tretinoin: Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits, and primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (32 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomologous monkey, a species in which tretinoin metabolism is closer to humans than in other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (324 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related teratogenic effects and increased abortion rates were reported in pigtail macaques. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during 2 decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to fetus is not known. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. However, orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established. Clinical trials of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel included 2,086 patients aged 12 - 17 years of age with acne vulgaris.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin: [See Microbiology ( 12.4 ).] Tretinoin: Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In an open-label study of 17 patients with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, topical administration of approximately 3 grams of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel once daily for 5 days, clindamycin concentrations were quantifiable in all 17 patients starting from 1 hour post-dose. All plasma clindamycin concentrations were \u22645.56 ng/mL on Day 5, with the exception of 1 subject who had a maximum clindamycin concentration of 8.73 ng/mL at 4 hours post-dose. There was no appreciable increase in systemic exposure to tretinoin, as compared with the baseline value. The average tretinoin concentration across all sampling times on Day 5 ranged from 1.19 to 1.23 ng/mL compared with the corresponding baseline mean tretinoin concentration range of 1.16 to 1.30 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product. Mechanism of Action: Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer, thereby suppressing protein synthesis. Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) , an organism that has been associated with acne vulgaris; however, the clinical significance of this activity against P. acnes was not examined in clinical studies with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel. P. acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented. Inducible Clindamycin Resistance: The treatment of acne with antimicrobials is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance in P. acnes as well as other bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes ). The use of clindamycin may result in developing inducible resistance in these organisms. This resistance is not detected by routine susceptibility testing. Cross Resistance: Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin."

Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was negative for mutagenic potential when evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion assay. Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was equivocal for clastogenic potential in the absence of metabolic activation when tested in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay. Clindamycin: Once-daily dermal administration of 1% clindamycin as clindamycin phosphate in the gel vehicle (32 mg/kg/day, 13 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) to mice for up to 2 years did not produce evidence of tumorigenicity. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day of clindamycin (240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Tretinoin: In 2 independent mouse studies where tretinoin was administered topically (0.025% or 0.1%) 3 times per week for up to 2 years no carcinogenicity was observed, with maximum effects of dermal amyloidosis. However, in a dermal carcinogenicity study in mice, tretinoin applied at a dose of 5.1 mcg (1.4 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) 3 times per week for 20 weeks acted as a weak promoter of skin tumor formation following a single application of dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA). In a study in female SENCAR mice, papillomas were induced by topical exposure to DMBA followed by promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or mezerein for up to 20 weeks. Topical application of tretinoin prior to each application of promoting agent resulted in a reduction in the number of papillomas per mouse. However, papillomas resistant to topical tretinoin suppression were at higher risk for pre-malignant progression. Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photoco-carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies, employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to tretinoin and UV radiation. The photoco-carcinogenic potential of the clindamycin tretinoin combination is unknown. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should avoid exposure to sun. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both tests were negative. In oral fertility studies in rats treated with tretinoin, the no-observed-effect-level was 2 mg/kg/day (64 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris, was evaluated in 12-week multi-center, randomized, blinded studies in subjects 12 years and older. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a 2-grade improvement from baseline to Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and a mean absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in 2 out of 3 (total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory) lesion counts. The IGA scoring scale used in all the clinical trials for clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is as follows: 0 Clear Normal, clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris. 1 Almost Clear Skin almost clear; rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red) requiring no further treatment in the Investigator\u2019s opinion. 2 Mild Some non-inflammatory lesions are present, with few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodulo-cystic lesions). 3 Moderate Non-inflammatory lesions predominate, with multiple inflammatory lesions evident; several-to-many comedones and papules/pustules, and there may or may not be 1 small nodulo-cystic lesion. 4 Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent; many comedones and papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulo-cystic lesions. 5 Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate; variable numbers of comedones, many papules/pustules and nodulo-cystic lesions. In Study 1, 1,649 subjects were randomized to clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel, clindamycin gel, tretinoin gel, and vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 17 years and 58% were females. At baseline, subjects had an average of 71 total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 25.5 lesions and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 45.1 lesions.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions: General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

      "Dosage and Administration: Tretinoin gel or cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of over application by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Topical over-the-counter acne preparations, concomitant topical medications, medicated cleansers, topical products with alcohol or astringents: Use with caution, irritation may occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid unprotected exposure to sunlight including sunlamps (UV light) when using Tretinoin Gel due to potential for increased photosensitization. Use sunscreen of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during exposure. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Avoid use of Tretinoin Gel with weather extremes, such as wind or cold due to potential for increased irritation. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Use Tretinoin Gel with caution if allergic to fish due to potential for allergenicity to fish protein. Patients who develop pruritus or urticaria should contact their healthcare provider. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Skin Irritation The skin of certain individuals may become dry, red, or exfoliated while using Tretinoin Gel. If the degree of irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily reduce the amount or frequency of application of the medication, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use all together. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Mild to moderate skin dryness may also be experienced; if so, use of an appropriate moisturizer during the day may be helpful. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous or sunburned skin and should be used with caution in patients with these conditions. To help limit skin irritation, patients must: \u2022 wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry, \u2022 avoid washing the treated skin too often and scrubbing the affected skin area, and \u2022 avoid contact with the peels of limes. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of Tretinoin Gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin. 5.3 Fish Allergies Tretinoin Gel contains soluble fish proteins and should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to fish. Patients who develop pruritus or urticaria should contact their healthcare provider."

In two randomized, controlled trials, 674 subjects received treatment for up to 12 weeks with Tretinoin Gel [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .In these studies, 50% of the subjects who were treated with Tretinoin Gel reported one or more adverse reactions; 30% of the subjects reported treatment-related adverse reactions. In the vehicle group, 29% of the 487 randomized subjects reported at least one adverse reaction; 5% of the subjects reported events that were treatment-related. There were no serious, treatment-related adverse reactions reported by subjects in any of the treatment groups. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the two trials combined are shown in Table 1 (below). Most skin-related adverse reactions first appear during the first two weeks of treatment with Tretinoin Gel, and the incidence rate for skin-related reactions peaks around the second and third week of treatment.

Tretinoin Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Tretinoin Gel at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 g/kg/day was tested for maternal and developmental toxicity in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by dermal application. The dose of 1 g/kg/day was approximately 4 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison. Possible tretinoin-associated teratogenic effects (craniofacial abnormalities (hydrocephaly), asymmetrical thyroids, variations in ossification, and increased supernumerary ribs) were noted in the fetuses of Tretinoin Gel treated animals. These findings were not observed in control animals. Other maternal and reproductive parameters in the Tretinoin Gel treated animals were not different from control. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure, the clinical dose is defined as 2 g of Tretinoin Gel applied daily to a 50 kg person. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin was teratogenic in Wistar rats when given orally in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 80 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in a different formulation has generated equivocal results in animal teratogenicity tests. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 160 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison) was topically applied. Supernumerary ribs have been a consistent finding in rats when dams were treated topically or orally with retinoids. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported with use of other topical tretinoin products. The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects on fetuses: Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 20 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 8 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tretinoin Gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 10 have not been established. A total of 381 pediatric subjects (aged 10 to 16 years) treated with Tretinoin Gel were enrolled into the two clinical studies. Across these two studies, comparable safety and efficacy were observed between pediatric and adult subjects. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of Tretinoin Gel did not include any subjects over age 65 to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tretinoin Gel, 0.05% is a translucent to opaque, pale yellow gel containing 0.05% tretinoin, by weight for topical administration. Chemically, tretinoin is all- trans -retinoic acid, also known as (all- E )-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1- cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds, and a metabolite of Vitamin A. Tretinoin has a molecular weight of 300.44, a molecular formula of C 20 H 28 O 2 and the following structure: Each gram of Tretinoin Gel, 0.05% contains 0.5 mg of tretinoin. Other components of this formulation are benzyl alcohol, butylparaben, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer homopolymer Type C, ethylparaben, fish collagen hydrolyzates, glycerin, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, octoxynol 9, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, purified water, sodium hyaluronate, and trolamine. The contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been evaluated. chemstructure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product. Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoid acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms, or both. Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In two (2) studies, the plasma levels of tretinoin and its major metabolites (13-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid) were investigated in a total of 14 patients (age: 13 \u2013 25 years) with severe acne, who applied 4 g \u00b1 0.5 g (range 3.5 g \u2013 4.5 g) of Tretinoin Gel once daily to face, back and chest, as compared to a mean of 0.71 g (range of 0.07 \u2013 3.71 g) applied in the controlled clinical trials. Blood samples were taken at baseline and immediately prior to treatment on days 1, 5, 10 and 14. On Day 14, the final study day, samples also were taken 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours, post-treatment. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites could be measured (LOQ = 0.5 ng/mL for all three analytes) in all patients at all time points. The range of plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-4-oxo-retinoic acid at baseline and after multiple once daily applications of Tretinoin Gel, 0.05% for 14 days are given in Table 2 (below). Although some patients had increased concentrations of tretinoin or its metabolites over baseline values, no consistent increase in these concentrations were observed across patients.

Although no drug-related tumors were observed in surviving animals, the irritating nature of the drug product precluded daily dosing, confounding data interpretation and reducing the biological significance of these results. Studies in hairless albino mice with a different formulation suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect was confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro bacterial reversion test, an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay. All tests were negative. In dermal fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 , approximately 4 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day and above (1.5 mg/m 2 , approximately 2 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) were observed."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. Pharmacokinetics: In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies with tretinoin cream indicate that less than 0.3% of the topically applied dose is bioavailable. Circulating plasma levels of both tretinoin and isotretinoin are only slightly elevated above those found in healthy normal controls."

      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps or artificial sunlight, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, the paranasal creases, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Information for Patients See attached Patient Package Insert . Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin cream. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin cream is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a life-time dermal study in CD-1 mice with another tretinoin cream, at 100 and 200 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose, a few skin tumors in the female mice and liver tumors in male mice were observed. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when tretinoin was administered topically at a dose five times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the \u201crecommended human topical clinical dose\u201d is defined as 1.0 g of 0.025% Tretinoin Cream applied daily to a 50 kg person. In a chronic, two-year bioassay of vitamin A acid in mice performed by Tsubura and Yamamoto, generalized amyloid deposition was reported in all vitamin A treated groups in the basal layer of the skin. In CD-1 mice, a similar study reported hyalinization at the treated skin sites and the incidence of this finding was 0/50, 3/50, 3/50, and 2/50 in male mice and 1/50, 0/50, 4/50, and 2/50 in female mice from the vehicle control, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively. Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. In other studies, when lightly pigmented hairless mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to carcinogenic doses of UVA/UVB light, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors were either reduced or no effect was seen. Due to significantly different experimental conditions, no strict comparison of these disparate data is possible at this time. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. Dermal Segment I and III studies with tretinoin cream have not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (> 400 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose). Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats when given orally in doses 1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increased embryolethality and abortion were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%; os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported in rats when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied. Topical tretinoin (Tretinoin Cream, 0.1%) has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when given in doses 91 times the topical human dose for cream (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.1% cream topically). In this study, increased incidence of cleft palate and hydrocephaly was reported in the tretinoin-treated animals. There are other reports, in New Zealand White rabbits with doses of approximately 80 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. When given subcutaneously to rabbits, tretinoin was teratogenic at 2 mg/kg/day but not at 1 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 400 and 200 times, respectively, the human topical dose of tretinoin cream, 0.025% (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.025% cream topically). In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin was not teratogenic at doses of 100 and 200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, in rats and rabbits, respectively. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A). Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 100 times the recommended topical human clinical dose. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 500 times the recommended topical human clinical dose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% should not be used during pregnancy. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin cream is administered to a nursing woman."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a life-time dermal study in CD-1 mice with another tretinoin cream, at 100 and 200 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose, a few skin tumors in the female mice and liver tumors in male mice were observed. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when tretinoin was administered topically at a dose five times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the \u201crecommended human topical clinical dose\u201d is defined as 1.0 g of 0.025% Tretinoin Cream applied daily to a 50 kg person. In a chronic, two-year bioassay of vitamin A acid in mice performed by Tsubura and Yamamoto, generalized amyloid deposition was reported in all vitamin A treated groups in the basal layer of the skin. In CD-1 mice, a similar study reported hyalinization at the treated skin sites and the incidence of this finding was 0/50, 3/50, 3/50, and 2/50 in male mice and 1/50, 0/50, 4/50, and 2/50 in female mice from the vehicle control, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively. Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. In other studies, when lightly pigmented hairless mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to carcinogenic doses of UVA/UVB light, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors were either reduced or no effect was seen. Due to significantly different experimental conditions, no strict comparison of these disparate data is possible at this time. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. Dermal Segment I and III studies with tretinoin cream have not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (> 400 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose)."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats when given orally in doses 1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose. However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increased embryolethality and abortion were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%; os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported in rats when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied. Topical tretinoin (Tretinoin Cream, 0.1%) has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when given in doses 91 times the topical human dose for cream (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.1% cream topically). In this study, increased incidence of cleft palate and hydrocephaly was reported in the tretinoin-treated animals. There are other reports, in New Zealand White rabbits with doses of approximately 80 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. When given subcutaneously to rabbits, tretinoin was teratogenic at 2 mg/kg/day but not at 1 mg/kg/day. These doses are approximately 400 and 200 times, respectively, the human topical dose of tretinoin cream, 0.025% (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.025% cream topically). In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin was not teratogenic at doses of 100 and 200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, in rats and rabbits, respectively. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A). Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 100 times the recommended topical human clinical dose. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 500 times the recommended topical human clinical dose. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% should not be used during pregnancy."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transient feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once-daily dosing frequencies. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent increase in number and exacerbation of inflammatory acne lesions may occur. This is due, in part, to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Patients treated with tretinoin cream may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS section)."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS TRETINOIN CREAM USP, 0.025% Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN CREAM ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin: As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin cream may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings: When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors were reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun: When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin cream should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps or artificial sunlight while you are using Tretinoin Cream, 0.025%. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin cream until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold: Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin cream may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems: The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered, or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin cream and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin cream developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. Use other medication only on your physician\u2019s advice: Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos, and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin cream which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin cream in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying Tretinoin Cream, 0.025%. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN CREAM To get the best results with tretinoin cream therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin cream is used properly, many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, in the evening, or as directed by your physician, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication, and won\u2019t give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have had some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin, and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. If needed, you may apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) in the morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin Cream, 0.025% works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin cream work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin cream may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin cream and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage, it is important to continue using tretinoin cream. If tretinoin cream is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice an improvement in your appearance by 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control, you should continue regular application of tretinoin cream until your physician instructs otherwise. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Distributed by: Actavis Pharma, Inc. Parsippany, NJ 07054 USA Revised - November 2019"

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Topical over-the-counter acne preparations, concomitant topical medications, medicated cleansers, topical products with alcohol or astringents: Use with caution, irritation may occur. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Avoid unprotected exposure to sunlight including sunlamps (UV light) when using tretinoin gel due to potential for increased photosensitization. Use sunscreen of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during exposure. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Avoid use of tretinoin gel with weather extremes, such as wind or cold due to potential for increased irritation. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Use tretinoin gel with caution if allergic to fish due to potential for allergenicity to fish protein. Patients who develop pruritus or urticaria should contact their health care provider. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Skin Irritation The skin of certain individuals may become dry, red, or exfoliated while using tretinoin gel. If the degree of irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily reduce the amount or frequency of application of the medication, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use all together. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Mild to moderate skin dryness may also be experienced; if so, use of an appropriate moisturizer during the day may be helpful. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous or sunburned skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with these conditions. To help limit skin irritation, patients must: \u2022 wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry \u2022 avoid washing the treated skin too often and scrubbing the affected skin area \u2022 avoid contact with the peels of limes 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin. 5.3 Fish Allergies Tretinoin gel contains soluble fish proteins and should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to fish. Patients who develop pruritus or urticaria should contact their health care provider."

In two randomized, controlled trials, 674 subjects received treatment for up to 12 weeks with tretinoin gel [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . In these studies, 50% of the subjects who were treated with tretinoin gel reported one or more adverse reactions; 30% of the subjects reported treatment-related adverse reactions. In the vehicle group, 29% of the 487 randomized subjects reported at least one adverse reaction; 5% of the subjects reported events that were treatment-related. There were no serious, treatment-related adverse reactions reported by subjects in any of the treatment groups. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the two studies combined are shown in Table 1 (below). Most skin-related adverse reactions first appear during the first two weeks of treatment with tretinoin gel, and the incidence rate for skin-related reactions peaks around the second and third week of treatment. In some subjects the skin-related adverse reactions persist throughout the treatment period. Table 1.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women treated with tretinoin gel. Tretinoin gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Tretinoin gel at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 g/kg/day was tested for maternal and developmental toxicity in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by dermal application. The dose of 1 g/kg/day was approximately 4 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison. Possible tretinoin-associated teratogenic effects (craniofacial abnormalities (hydrocephaly), asymmetrical thyroids, variations in ossification, and increased supernumerary ribs) were noted in the fetuses of tretinoin gel treated animals. These findings were not observed in control animals. Other maternal and reproductive parameters in the tretinoin gel treated animals were not different from control. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure, the clinical dose is defined as 2 g of tretinoin gel applied daily to a 50 kg person. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin was teratogenic in Wistar rats when given orally in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 80 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in a different formulation has generated equivocal results in animal teratogenicity tests. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 8 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 160 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison) was topically applied. Supernumerary ribs have been a consistent finding in rats when dams were treated topically or orally with retinoids. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported with use of other topical tretinoin products. The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects on Fetus Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 20 times the clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 8 times the clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 10 have not been established. A total of 381 pediatric subjects (aged 10 to 16 years), treated with tretinoin gel were enrolled into the two clinical studies. Across these two studies, comparable safety and efficacy were observed between pediatric and adult subjects. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin gel did not include any subjects over age 65 to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product. Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms, or both. Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In two (2) studies, the plasma levels of tretinoin and its major metabolites (13-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid) were investigated in a total of 14 patients (age: 13 \u2013 25 years) with severe acne, who applied 4 g \u00b1 0.5 g (range 3.5 g \u2013 4.5 g) of tretinoin gel once daily to face, back and chest, as compared to a mean of 0.71 g (range of 0.07 \u2013 3.71 g) applied in the controlled clinical trials. Blood samples were taken at baseline and immediately prior to treatment on days 1, 5, 10 and 14. On Day 14, the final study day, samples also were taken 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours, post-treatment. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites could be measured (LOQ = 0.5 ng/mL for all three analytes) in all patients at all time points. The range of plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-4-oxo-retinoic acid at baseline and after multiple once daily applications of tretinoin gel 0.05% for 14 days are given in Table 2 (below). Although some patients had increased concentrations of tretinoin or its metabolites over baseline values, no consistent increase in these concentrations were observed across patients. Table 2.

Although no drug-related tumors were observed in surviving animals, the irritating nature of the drug product precluded daily dosing, confounding data interpretation and reducing the biological significance of these results. Studies in hairless albino mice with a different formulation suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect was confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro bacterial reversion test, an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay. All tests were negative. In dermal fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 , approximately 4 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day and above (1.5 mg/m 2 , approximately 2 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), were observed."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling ( Patient Information ) Instruct patients to clean the affected areas with an appropriate cleanser before applying tretinoin gel. Patients may use moisturizers that are non-comedogenic, and should avoid products that could be drying or irritating. Patients may also wear cosmetics while being treated with tretinoin gel; however, they should be instructed to remove the cosmetics and clean the area thoroughly before applying tretinoin gel. Warn patients of the drying and irritation effects often seen during treatment. Continue use of the medication if these effects are tolerable. Caution patients against application of tretinoin gel around the eyes, mouth, paranasal creases, and mucous membranes as this skin is especially prone to irritation. Minimize exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps. Recommend the use of sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) when exposure cannot be avoided.

      "Patient Information Tretinoin Gel USP, 0.05% (tret\u2032 i noyn) For topical use Important information: Tretinoin gel is for use on skin only. Do not get tretinoin gel in your mouth, eyes, vagina, or the corners of your nose. What is tretinoin gel? Tretinoin gel is a prescription medicine used on the skin (topical) to treat acne. Acne is a condition in which the skin has blackheads, whiteheads, and other pimples. It is not known if tretinoin gel is safe and effective in children under 10 years of age. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using tretinoin gel? Before using tretinoin gel, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u2022 are allergic to fish. Tretinoin gel contains fish proteins. Tell your healthcare provider if you get hives or itching during treatment with tretinoin gel. \u2022 have a skin condition called eczema \u2022 have a sunburn \u2022 are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if tretinoin gel will harm your unborn baby. \u2022 are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if tretinoin passes into breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbal supplements, and any skin products that you use. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you use any other medicines to treat your acne, including medicated cleansers or soaps. Using other topical acne products may increase the irritation of your skin when used with tretinoin gel. How should I use tretinoin gel? \u2022 Use tretinoin gel exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. \u2022 Before you apply tretinoin gel, gently wash the affected skin area with a mild, non-medicated soap. Rinse and pat your skin dry. \u2022 Apply tretinoin gel 1 time a day before bedtime. \u2022 Apply a thin layer of tretinoin gel to cover the affected skin areas. Gently rub tretinoin gel into your skin. \u2022 Do not use more tretinoin gel than you need to cover the affected area and do not apply tretinoin gel more than 1 time a day. Using too much tretinoin gel may irritate or increase the irritation of your skin, and will not give faster or better results. \u2022 You may use moisturizers and cosmetics. What should I avoid while using tretinoin gel? \u2022 Avoid washing your skin too often and scrubbing the affected skin area. \u2022 You should avoid sunlamps, tanning beds, and ultraviolet light during treatment with tretinoin gel. \u2022 Minimize exposure to sunlight. \u2022 If you have to be in the sunlight or are sensitive to sunlight, use a sunscreen with a SPF (sun protection factor) of 15 or more and wear protective clothing, and a wide brimmed hat to cover the treated areas. \u2022 If you do get sunburned, stop using tretinoin gel until your skin has healed and is back to normal. \u2022 Cold weather and wind may irritate skin treated with tretinoin gel. Skin treated with tretinoin gel may dry out or get wind burned more easily. Talk to your healthcare provider/doctor about ways to manage skin irritation. \u2022 Avoid contact with the peels of limes. What are the possible side effects of tretinoin gel? Tretinoin gel may cause skin irritation, including: skin dryness, burning, redness, excessive flaking or peeling. If you develop these symptoms, your healthcare provider may tell you to stop using tretinoin gel for a while, decrease the number of times you apply tretinoin gel, or completely stop treatment with tretinoin gel. It is not known if tretinoin gel is effective when used less than 1 time a day. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all of the side effects possible with tretinoin gel. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How do I store tretinoin gel? \u2022 Store tretinoin gel at room temperature, 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F). \u2022 Protect from freezing.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For topical use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Tretinoin Gel Microsphere should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area in a thin layer. Areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. A transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging may be noted on application. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or the frequency of application increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily dosing frequencies. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. If tolerated, this should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Therapeutic results may be noticed after two weeks, but more than seven weeks of therapy are required before consistent beneficial effects are observed. Tretinoin Gel Microsphere should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, paranasal creases of the nose, and mucous membranes. Patients treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere may use cosmetics. Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, products that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, or spices should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Avoid contact with the peel of limes. Particular caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of topical over-the-counter acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere. It also is advisable to allow the effects of such preparations to subside before use of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere is begun. \u2022 Apply a thin layer of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere once daily, before bedtime, to skin where lesions occur. Keep away from eyes, mouth, nasal creases, and mucous membranes. (2 ) \u2022 Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. ( 2 )"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Tretinoin Gel Microsphere should not be used on eczematous or sunburned skin due to potential for severe irritation. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Avoid unprotected exposure to sunlight including sunlamps (UV light), when using Tretinoin Gel Microsphere due to potential for increased photosensitization. Use sunscreen of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during exposure. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Avoid use of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere with weather extremes, such as wind or cold due to potential for increased irritation. (5.2 ) 5.1 Local Irritation The skin of certain individuals may become excessively dry, red, swollen, or blistered. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. If the degree of irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily reduce the amount or frequency of application of the medication, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use all together. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. To help limit skin irritation, patients must: \u2022 wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry, and \u2022 avoid washing the treated skin too often or scrubbing it hard when washing. Patients should apply a topical moisturizer if dryness is bothersome. 5.2 Exposure to Ultraviolet Light or Weather Extremes Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps (UV light) should be avoided or minimized during the use of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have extended periods of UV exposure (e.g., due to occupation or sports), or those with inherent sensitivity to the sun, or those using medications that cause photosensitivity, should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products (SPF 15 or higher) and protective clothing over treated areas are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are skin pain, pruritus, skin irritation/subcutaneous irritation, pharyngitis, and erythema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oceanside Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Subjects with Acne In separate clinical trials for each concentration, acne subjects treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1% or 0.04%, over the twelve-week period showed that cutaneous irritation scores for erythema, peeling, dryness, burning/stinging, or itching peaked during the initial two weeks of therapy, decreasing thereafter. Approximately half of the subjects treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04%, had cutaneous irritation at Week 2. Of those subjects who did experience cutaneous side effects, most had signs or symptoms that were mild in severity (severity was ranked on a 4-point ordinal scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). Less than 10% of patients experienced moderate cutaneous irritation and there was no severe irritation at Week 2. In trials of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04%, throughout the treatment period the majority of subjects experienced some degree of irritation (mild, moderate, or severe) with 1% (2/225) of subjects having scores indicative of a severe irritation; 1.3% (3/225) of subjects treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04%, discontinued treatment due to irritation, which included dryness in one patient and peeling and urticaria in another. In trials of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, no more than 3% of subjects had cutaneous irritation scores indicative of severe irritation; 6% (14/224) of subjects treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, discontinued treatment due to irritation. Of these 14 subjects, four had severe irritation after 3 to 5 days of treatment, with blistering in one subject. In a double-blind trial with 156 acne subjects comparing 12 weeks of treatment with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04% or 0.1%, (78 subjects each group), the most frequently-reported adverse events affected the skin and subcutaneous tissue (15.4% in the 0.04% group, and 20.5% in the 0.1% group). The most prevalent of the dermatologic adverse events in the 0.04% group was skin irritation (6.4%); and in the 0.1% group skin burning (7.7%), erythema (5.1%), skin irritation (3.8%), and dermatitis (3.8%). Most adverse events were of mild intensity (63.4%), and 34.4% were moderate. One subject in each group had adverse events characterized as severe, neither were dermatologic findings and neither was characterized as related to drug by the investigator. Trials in Subjects without Acne In a half-face comparison trial conducted for up to 14 days in women with sensitive skin, but without acne, Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, was statistically less irritating than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. In addition, a cumulative 21-day irritation evaluation in subjects with normal skin showed that Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, had a lower irritation profile than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. The clinical significance of these irritation studies for patients with acne is not established. Comparable effectiveness of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, and tretinoin cream, 0.1%, has not been established. The lower irritancy of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, in subjects without acne may be attributable to the properties of its vehicle. The contribution of decreased irritancy by the MICROSPONGE \u00ae System has not been established. No irritation trials have been performed to compare Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04%, with either Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, or tretinoin cream, 0.1%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Tretinoin Gel Microsphere should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant and nursing women. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin Gel Microsphere should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin products. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the MRHD applied topically is defined as 1 gram of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, applied daily to a 60 kg person (0.017 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Pregnant rats were treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 6-15. Alterations were seen in vertebrae and ribs of offspring at 5 to 10 times the MRHD based on the body surface area (BSA) comparison. Pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were treated with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 7-19. Doses were administered topically for 24 hours a day while wearing Elizabethan collars to prevent ingestion of the drug. Increased incidences of certain alterations, including domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species, were observed at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. Similar malformations were not observed at 0.2 mg/kg/day, 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Other pregnant rabbits exposed topically for six hours per day to 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin while restrained in stocks to prevent ingestion, did not show any malformations at doses up to 19 times (1.0 mg/kg/day) the MRHD based on BSA comparison, but fetal resorptions were increased at 0.5 mg/kg (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Oral tretinoin has been shown to cause malformations in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin induced fetal malformations in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (95 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. In oral peri- and postnatal development studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Nonteratogenic effects on fetus Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered at doses 24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered at doses 10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether tretinoin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tretinoin Gel Microsphere is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical trials of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, 0.08% and 0.04%, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, 0.08% and 0.04% is a white to very pale yellow opaque gel for topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid, also known as (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds and a metabolite of naturally occurring Vitamin A. Tretinoin has a molecular weight of 300.44, a molecular formula of C 20 H 28 O 2 and the following chemical structure: Each gram of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, contains 1 mg of tretinoin. Each gram of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.08%, contains 0.8 mg of tretinoin. Each gram of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04%, contains 0.4 mg of tretinoin. The formulation contains methyl methacrylate/glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer (MICROSPONGE \u00ae System), propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate and butylated hydroxytoluene to enable inclusion of the active ingredient, tretinoin, in an aqueous gel. Other components consist of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer 974P, cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol, disodium EDTA, glycerin, PPG-20 methyl glucose ether distearate, propylene glycol, purified water, sorbic acid, and trolamine. chemstructure.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors and/or other mechanisms. The exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown. Current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A metabolism in man. Percutaneous absorption, as determined by the cumulative excretion of radiolabeled drug into urine and feces, was assessed in 44 healthy men and women after single and repeated daily applications of 500 mg of a 0.1% tretinoin gel formulation. Estimates of in vivo bioavailability, mean (SD)%, following both single and multiple daily applications, for a period of 28 days with the 0.1% gel, were 0.82 (0.11)% and 1.41 (0.54)%, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid, all- trans -4-oxo-retinoic acid, and 13- cis -4-oxo-retinoic acid, generally ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL and were essentially unaltered after either single or multiple daily applications of Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.1%, relative to baseline levels. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with Tretinoin Gel Microsphere, 0.04%."

In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. These concentrations are near the tretinoin concentration of the 0.04% and 0.1% clinical formulations. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin, respectively. These doses are two and four times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. The components of the microspheres have shown potential for genetic toxicity and fetal malformation. EGDMA, a component of the excipient acrylates copolymer, was positive for induction of structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian cells in the absence of metabolic activation, and negative for genetic toxicity in the Ames assay, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. In oral fertility studies in rats with tretinoin, the no-observable effect level was 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology: Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Precautions: General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin preparations for acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions: Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility: In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "Dosage and Administration: Tretinoin gel or cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gel: Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of over application by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin preparations may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see Precautions )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chances of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your doctor\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20-30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2014 BE PATIENT \u2014 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2014 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 to 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes, and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Tretinoin Cream: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 Tretinoin Gel: Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, edematous, blistered, or crusted. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the medication should be adjusted to a level the patient can tolerate. True contact allergy to topical tretinoin is rarely encountered. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin. Some individuals have been reported to have heightened susceptibility to sunlight while under treatment with tretinoin. To date, all adverse effects of tretinoin have been reversible upon discontinuance of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin Cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied ( see PRECAUTIONS )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.1% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Clinical Pharmacology Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones."

      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light form a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Cream USP, 0.1% For Topical Use Only Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of overapplication by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin gel acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Gel, USP Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using For Topical Use Only THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN GEL ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin gel may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin gel were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin gel should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin gel. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin gel until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin gel may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin gel and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin gel developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin gel or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin gel which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin gel in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN GEL THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin gel. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN GEL To get the best results with tretinoin gel therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin gel is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2013 BE PATIENT \u2013 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. Apply tretinoin gel once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin gel every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so , you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin gel works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin gel work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin gel may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin gel and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin gel. If tretinoin gel is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin gel until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For topical use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area in a thin layer. Areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. A transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging may be noted on application. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or the frequency of application increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily dosing frequencies. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. If tolerated, this should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therapeutic results may be noticed after two weeks, but more than seven weeks of therapy are required before consistent beneficial effects are observed. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, paranasal creases of the nose, and mucous membranes. Patients treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere) may use cosmetics. Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, products that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, or spices should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Avoid contact with the peel of limes. Particular caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of topical over-the-counter acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin gel (microsphere). It also is advisable to allow the effects of such preparations to subside before use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) is begun. Apply a thin layer of tretinoin gel (microsphere) once daily, before bedtime, to skin where lesions occur. Keep away from eyes, mouth, nasal creases, and mucous membranes.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should not be used on eczematous or sunburned skin due to potential for severe irritation. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Avoid unprotected exposure to sunlight including sunlamps (UV light), when using tretinoin gel (microsphere) due to potential for increased photosensitization. Use sunscreen of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing during exposure. ( 5.2 ) Avoid use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) with weather extremes, such as wind or cold due to potential for increased irritation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Local Irritation The skin of certain individuals may become excessively dry, red, swollen, or blistered. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. If the degree of irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily reduce the amount or frequency of application of the medication, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use all together. Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. To help limit skin irritation, patients must wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry, and avoid washing the treated skin too often or scrubbing it hard when washing. Patients should apply a topical moisturizer if dryness is bothersome. 5.2 Exposure to Ultraviolet Light or Weather Extremes Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps (UV light) should be avoided or minimized during the use of tretinoin gel (microsphere) and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have extended periods of UV exposure (e.g., due to occupation or sports), or those with inherent sensitivity to the sun, or those using medications that cause photosensitivity, should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products (SPF 15 or higher) and protective clothing over treated areas are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are skin pain, pruritus, skin irritation/subcutaneous irritation, pharyngitis, and erythema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals Private Limited at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials in Subjects with Acne In separate clinical trials for each concentration, acne subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1% or 0.04%, over the twelve- week period showed that cutaneous irritation scores for erythema, peeling, dryness, burning/stinging, or itching peaked during the initial two weeks of therapy, decreasing thereafter. Approximately half of the subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, had cutaneous irritation at Week 2. Of those subjects who did experience cutaneous side effects, most had signs or symptoms that were mild in severity (severity was ranked on a 4-point ordinal scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). Less than 10% of patients experienced moderate cutaneous irritation and there was no severe irritation at Week 2. In trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, throughout the treatment period the majority of subjects experienced some degree of irritation (mild, moderate, or severe) with 1% (2/225) of subjects having scores indicative of a severe irritation; 1.3% (3/225) of subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, discontinued treatment due to irritation, which included dryness in one patient and peeling and urticaria in another. In trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, no more than 3% of subjects had cutaneous irritation scores indicative of severe irritation; 6% (14/224) of subjects treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, discontinued treatment due to irritation. Of these 14 subjects, four had severe irritation after 3 to 5 days of treatment, with blistering in one subject. In a double-blind trial with 156 acne subjects comparing 12 weeks of treatment with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04% or 0.1%, (78 subjects each group), the most frequently-reported adverse events affected the skin and subcutaneous tissue (15.4% in the 0.04% group, and 20.5% in the 0.1% group). The most prevalent of the dermatologic adverse events in the 0.04% group was skin irritation (6.4%); and in the 0.1% group skin burning (7.7%), erythema (5.1%), skin irritation (3.8%), and dermatitis (3.8%). Most adverse events were of mild intensity (63.4%), and 34.4% were moderate. One subject in each group had adverse events characterized as severe, neither were dermatologic findings and neither was characterized as related to drug by the investigator. Trials in Subjects without Acne In a half-face comparison trial conducted for up to 14 days in women with sensitive skin, but without acne, tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, was statistically less irritating than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. In addition, a cumulative 21- day irritation evaluation in subjects with normal skin showed that tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, had a lower irritation profile than tretinoin cream, 0.1%. The clinical significance of these irritation studies for patients with acne is not established. Comparable effectiveness of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, and tretinoin cream, 0.1%, has not been established. The lower irritancy of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, in subjects without acne may be attributable to the properties of its vehicle. The contribution of decreased irritancy by the acrylate copolymer microsphere system has not been established. No irritation trials have been performed to compare tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.04%, with either tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, or tretinoin cream, 0.1%. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tretinoin gel (microsphere). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant and nursing women. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin gel (microsphere) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin products. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the MRHD applied topically is defined as 1 gram of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, applied daily to a 60 kg person (0.017 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Pregnant rats were treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 6-15. Alterations were seen in vertebrae and ribs of offspring at 5 to 10 times the MRHD based on the body surface area (BSA) comparison. Pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were treated with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, at daily dermal doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin on gestation days 7-19. Doses were administered topically for 24 hours a day while wearing Elizabethan collars to prevent ingestion of the drug. Increased incidences of certain alterations, including domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species, were observed at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day. Similar malformations were not observed at 0.2 mg/kg/day, 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Other pregnant rabbits exposed topically for six hours per day to 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin while restrained in stocks to prevent ingestion, did not show any malformations at doses up to 19 times (1.0 mg/kg/day) the MRHD based on BSA comparison, but fetal resorptions were increased at 0.5 mg/kg (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Oral tretinoin has been shown to cause malformations in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin induced fetal malformations in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (95 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. In oral peri- and postnatal development studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Nonteratogenic effects on fetus Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered at doses 24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered at doses 10 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether tretinoin and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin gel (microsphere) is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical trials of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1% and 0.04%, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, is a white to very pale yellow opaque gel for topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid, also known as (all-E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds and a metabolite of naturally occurring Vitamin A. Tretinoin has a molecular weight of 300.44, a molecular formula of C 20 H 28 O 2 and the following chemical structure: Each gram of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, contains 0.8 mg of tretinoin. The formulation uses acrylate copolymer microsphere system to enable inclusion of the active ingredient, tretinoin, in an aqueous gel. Other components consist of benzyl alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer 974P, cyclomethicone and dimethicone copolyol, disodium EDTA, glycerin, PPG-20 methyl glucose ether distearate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, purified water, sorbic acid, and trolamine.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoic acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which may act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors and/or other mechanisms. The exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown. Current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A metabolism in man. Percutaneous absorption, as determined by the cumulative excretion of radiolabeled drug into urine and feces, was assessed in 44 healthy men and women after single and repeated daily applications of 500 mg of a 0.1% tretinoin gel formulation. Estimates of in vivo bioavailability, mean (SD) %, following both single and multiple daily applications, for a period of 28 days with the 0.1% gel, were 0.82 (0.11)% and 1.41 (0.54)%, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid, all- trans -4-oxo-retinoic acid, and 13- cis -4-oxo-retinoic acid, generally ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL and were essentially unaltered after either single or multiple daily applications of tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.1%, relative to baseline levels. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tretinoin gel (microsphere), 0.08%, 0.06% and 0.04%."

In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. These concentrations are near the tretinoin concentration of the 0.04% and 0.1% clinical formulations. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day tretinoin, respectively. These doses are two and four times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. The components of the microspheres have shown potential for genetic toxicity and fetal malformation. EGDMA, a component of the excipient acrylates copolymer, was positive for induction of structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in mammalian cells in the absence of metabolic activation, and negative for genetic toxicity in the Ames assay, and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. In oral fertility studies in rats with tretinoin, the no-observable effect level was 2 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison)."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

      "General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

      "Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \u201crest\u201d a patient\u2019s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietale incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Tretinoin gel should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Excessive application results in \u201cpilling\u201d of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of overapplication by the patient. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alterations of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after 2 to 3 weeks but more than 6 weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin gel acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied (see PRECAUTIONS )."

      "PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS Tretinoin Gel, USP Acne Treatment IMPORTANT Read Directions Carefully Before Using For Topical Use Only THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN GEL ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS TRETINOIN GELS ARE FLAMMABLE. AVOID FIRE, FLAME OR SMOKING DURING USE. Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C). PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin gel may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin gel, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin gel were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin gel should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin gel. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin gel until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin gel may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of tretinoin gel and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin gel developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin gel or therapy was discontinued. Use other medications only on your physician\u2019s advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician\u2019s instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin gel which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin gel in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication. AND WHILE YOU\u2019RE ON TRETINOIN GEL THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn\u2019t caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can\u2019t wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild, bland soap. Two or three times a day should be sufficient. Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin gel. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN GEL To get the best results with tretinoin gel therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin gel is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS \u2013 BE PATIENT \u2013 DON\u2019T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN \u2013 IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin gel once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin gel every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won\u2019t give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying. \u2022 Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication, you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, or if dry flaking occurs from the gel within a minute or so , you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin gel by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin gel works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin gel work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin gel may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin gel and this usually subsides within 2 to 4 weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY 3 TO 6 WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin gel. If tretinoin gel is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don\u2019t stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin gel until your physician instructs otherwise.

      "Precautions General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition. Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight).

A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area). Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species). With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of tretinoin. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic effects Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of tretinoin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of tretinoin cream, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin. Tretinoin acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with tretinoin. It also is advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tretinoin is begun."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment to Fertility In a 91-week dermal study in which CD-1 mice were administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations of tretinoin, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas in the treatment area were observed in some female mice. A dose-related incidence of liver tumors in male mice was observed at those same doses. The maximum systemic doses associated with the administered 0.017% and 0.035% formulations are 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are two and four times the maximum human systemic dose, when adjusted for total body surface area. The biological significance of these findings is not clear because they occurred at doses that exceeded the dermal maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of tretinoin and because they were within the background natural occurrence rate for these tumors in this strain of mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0.025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice (0.1 times the maximum human systemic dose, adjusted for total body surface area). For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0.1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person (0.02 mg tretinoin/kg body weight). Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect has been confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative. In dermal Segment I fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (4 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) and above were observed. A dermal Segment III study with tretinoin has not been performed in any species. In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (16 times the human topical dose adjusted for total body surface area)."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, hamsters, and subhuman primates. It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally or topically in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported. In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (83 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day was topically applied. There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species. In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species).

      "Dosage and Administration Tretinoin cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Application may cause a transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment. Alteration of vehicle, drug concentration, or dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. This is due to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen. Once the acne lesions have responded satisfactorily, it may be possible to maintain the improvement with less frequent applications, or other dosage forms. Patients treated with tretinoin acne treatment may use cosmetics, but the area to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. (See Precautions )"

THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR. WARNINGS Keep out of reach of children. Keep tube tightly closed. Do not expose to heat. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from freezing. PRECAUTIONS The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with tretinoin may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized. Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in tretinoin cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced . There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing. Use caution in the sun. When outside, even on hazy days, areas treated with tretinoin should be protected. An effective sunscreen should be used any time you are outside (consult your physician for a recommendation of an SPF level which will provide you with the necessary high level of protection). For extended sun exposure, protective clothing, like a hat, should be worn. Do not use artificial sunlamps while you are using tretinoin. If you do become sunburned, stop your therapy with tretinoin until your skin has recovered. Avoid excessive exposure to wind or cold. Extremes of climate tend to dry or burn normal skin. Skin treated with tretinoin may be more vulnerable to these extremes. Your physician can recommend ways to manage your acne treatment under such conditions. Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinues the use of tretinoin and consult your physician. There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with tretinoin developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to tretinoin or therapy was discontinued. Use other medication only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication. Do not use other medications with tretinoin which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of tretinoin in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using the medication. AND WHILE YOU'RE ON TRETINOIN THERAPY Use a mild, non-medicated soap. Avoid frequent washings and harsh scrubbing. Acne isn't caused by dirt, so no matter how hard you scrub, you can't wash it away. Washing too frequently or scrubbing too roughly may at times actually make your acne worse. Wash your skin gently with a mild bland soap. (Two or three times a day should be sufficient). Pat skin dry with a towel. Let the face dry 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin. Remember, excessive irritation such as rubbing, too much washing, use of other medications not suggested by your physician, etc., may worsen your acne. HOW TO USE TRETINOIN To get the best results with tretinoin therapy, it is necessary to use it properly. Forget about the instructions given for other products and the advice of friends. Just stick to the special plan your doctor has laid out for you and be patient. Remember, when tretinoin is used properly , many users see improvement by 12 weeks. AGAIN, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - BE PATIENT - DON'T START AND STOP THERAPY ON YOUR OWN - IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK YOUR DOCTOR. To help you use the medication correctly, keep these simple instructions in mind. \u2022 Apply tretinoin once daily before bedtime, or as directed by your physician. Your physician may advise, especially if your skin is sensitive, that you start your therapy by applying tretinoin every other night. First, wash with a mild soap and dry your skin gently. WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES BEFORE APPLYING MEDICATION; it is important for skin to be completely dry in order to minimize possible irritation. \u2022 It is better not to use more than the amount suggested by your physician or to apply more frequently than instructed. Too much may irritate the skin, waste medication and won't give faster or better results. \u2022 Keep the medication away from the corners of the nose, mouth, eyes and open wounds. Spread away from these areas when applying . \u2022 Squeeze about a half inch or less of medication onto the fingertip. While that should be enough for your whole face, after you have some experience with the medication you may find you need slightly more or less to do the job. The medication should become invisible almost immediately. If it is still visible, you are using too much. Cover the affected area lightly with tretinoin cream by first dabbing it on your forehead, chin and both cheeks, then spreading it over the entire affected area. Smooth gently into the skin. \u2022 It is recommended that you apply a moisturizer or a moisturizer with sunscreen that will not aggravate your acne (noncomedogenic) every morning after you wash. WHAT TO EXPECT WITH YOUR NEW TREATMENT Tretinoin works deep inside your skin and this takes time. You cannot make tretinoin work any faster by applying more than one dose each day, but an excess amount of tretinoin may irritate your skin. Be patient. There may be some discomfort or peeling during the early days of treatment. Some patients also notice that their skin begins to take on a blush. These reactions do not happen to everyone. If they do, it is just your skin adjusting to tretinoin and this usually subsides within two to four weeks. These reactions can usually be minimized by following instructions carefully. Should the effects become excessively troublesome, consult your doctor. BY THREE TO SIX WEEKS, some patients notice an appearance of new blemishes (papules and pustules). At this stage it is important to continue using tretinoin. If tretinoin is going to have a beneficial effect for you, you should notice a continued improvement in your appearance after 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Don't be discouraged if you see no immediate improvement. Don't stop treatment at the first signs of improvement. Once your acne is under control you should continue regular application of tretinoin until your physician instructs otherwise.

Mild to moderate skin dryness may also be experienced; if so, use of an appropriate moisturizer during the day may be helpful. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous or sunburned skin and should be used with caution in patients with these conditions. To help limit skin irritation, patients must: \u2022 wash the treated skin gently, using a mild, non-medicated soap, and pat it dry, \u2022 avoid washing the treated skin too often and scrubbing the affected skin area, and \u2022 avoid contact with the peels of limes. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Unprotected exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of Tretinoin Gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products of at least SPF 15 and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to tretinoin-treated skin. 5.3 Fish Allergies Tretinoin Gel contains soluble fish proteins and should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to fish. Patients who develop pruritus or urticaria should contact their healthcare provider."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) with Tretinoin Gel are dry skin, peeling/scaling/flaking skin, skin burning sensation, and erythema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oceanside Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under prescribing conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two randomized, controlled trials, 674 subjects received treatment for up to 12 weeks with Tretinoin Gel [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In these studies, 50% of the subjects who were treated with Tretinoin Gel reported one or more adverse reactions; 30% of the subjects reported treatment-related adverse reactions. In the vehicle group, 29% of the 487 randomized subjects reported at least one adverse reaction; 5% of the subjects reported events that were treatment-related. There were no serious, treatment-related adverse reactions reported by subjects in any of the treatment groups. Selected adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the two trials combined are shown in Table 1 (below). Most skin-related adverse reactions first appear during the first two weeks of treatment with Tretinoin Gel, and the incidence rate for skin-related reactions peaks around the second and third week of treatment. In some subjects, the skin-related adverse reactions persist throughout the treatment period. Table 1: Number of Subjects with Selected Adverse Reactions (Occurring in at Least 1% of Subjects) Event Tretinoin Gel (N = 674) Vehicle (N = 487) Dry Skin 109 (16%) 8 (2%) Peeling/Scaling/Flaking Skin 78 (12%) 7 (1%) Skin Burning Sensation 53 (8%) 8 (2%) Erythema 47 (7%) 1 (<1%) Pruritus 11 (2%) 3 (1%) Pain of Skin 7 (1%) 0 (0%) Sunburn 7 (1%) 3 (1%) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Tretinoin Gel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Temporary hyper- or hypopigmentation has been reported with repeated application of tretinoin."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with Tretinoin Gel. Tretinoin Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Tretinoin Gel at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 g/kg/day was tested for maternal and developmental toxicity in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by dermal application. The dose of 1 g/kg/day was approximately four times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison. Possible tretinoin-associated teratogenic effects (craniofacial abnormalities [hydrocephaly], asymmetrical thyroids, variations in ossification, and increased supernumerary ribs) were noted in the fetuses of Tretinoin Gel-treated animals. These findings were not observed in control animals. Other maternal and reproductive parameters in the Tretinoin Gel-treated animals were not different from control. For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure, the clinical dose is defined as 2 g of Tretinoin Gel applied daily to a 50 kg person. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters and nonhuman primates. Tretinoin was teratogenic in Wistar rats when given orally in doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately eight times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison). In the cynomolgus monkey, fetal malformations were reported for doses of 10 mg/kg/day, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 80 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. Dose-related increases in embryolethality and abortion also were reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Topical tretinoin in a different formulation has generated equivocal results in animal teratogenicity tests. There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (approximately eight times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison). Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%, os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported when 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 160 times the clinical dose assuming 100% absorption and based on body surface area comparison) was topically applied. Supernumerary ribs have been a consistent finding in rats when dams were treated topically or orally with retinoids. With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported with use of other topical tretinoin products. The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known. Nonteratogenic Effects on Fetuses: Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 20 times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison. Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses eight times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Tretinoin Gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 10 have not been established. A total of 381 pediatric subjects (aged 10 to 16 years) treated with Tretinoin Gel were enrolled into the two clinical studies. Across these two studies, comparable safety and efficacy were observed between pediatric and adult subjects. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of Tretinoin Gel did not include any subjects over age 65 to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Tretinoin Gel, 0.05% is a translucent to opaque, pale yellow gel containing 0.05% tretinoin, by weight for topical administration. Chemically, tretinoin is all- trans -retinoic acid, also known as (all- E )-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl)-2,4,6,8-nonatetraenoic acid. It is a member of the retinoid class of compounds, and a metabolite of Vitamin A. Tretinoin has a molecular weight of 300.44, a molecular formula of C 20 H 28 O 2 and the following structure: Each gram of Tretinoin Gel, 0.05% contains 0.5 mg of tretinoin. Other components of this formulation are benzyl alcohol, butylparaben, butylated hydroxytoluene, carbomer homopolymer Type C, ethylparaben, fish collagen hydrolyzates, glycerin, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, octoxynol 9, phenoxyethanol, propylparaben, purified water, sodium hyaluronate, and trolamine. The contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been evaluated. chem.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product. Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoid acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, and RAR\u03b3) which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms, or both. Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In two studies, the plasma levels of tretinoin and its major metabolites (13-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid) were investigated in a total of 14 patients (age: 13 \u2013 25 years) with severe acne, who applied 4 g \u00b1 0.5 g (range 3.5 g \u2013 4.5 g) of Tretinoin Gel once daily to face, back and chest, as compared to a mean of 0.71 g (range of 0.07 \u2013 3.71 g) applied in the controlled clinical trials. Blood samples were taken at baseline and immediately prior to treatment on Days 1, 5, 10 and 14. On Day 14, the final study day, samples also were taken 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-treatment. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites could be measured (LOQ = 0.5 ng/mL for all three analytes) in all patients at all time points. The range of plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-4-oxo-retinoic acid at baseline and after multiple once-daily applications of Tretinoin Gel, 0.05% for 14 days are given in Table 2 (below). Although some patients had increased concentrations of tretinoin or its metabolites over baseline values, no consistent increase in these concentrations were observed across patients.

Although no drug-related tumors were observed in surviving animals, the irritating nature of the drug product precluded daily dosing, confounding data interpretation and reducing the biological significance of these results. Studies in hairless albino mice with a different formulation suggest that concurrent exposure to tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVB and UVA light from a solar simulator. This effect was confirmed in a later study in pigmented mice, and dark pigmentation did not overcome the enhancement of photocarcinogenesis by 0.05% tretinoin. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet irradiation sources. The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro bacterial reversion test, an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay. All tests were negative. In dermal fertility studies of another tretinoin formulation in rats, slight (not statistically significant) decreases in sperm count and motility were seen at 0.5 mg/kg/day (3 mg/m 2 , approximately four times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison), and slight (not statistically significant) increases in the number and percent of nonviable embryos in females treated with 0.25 mg/kg/day and above (1.5 mg/m 2 , approximately two times the clinical dose based on body surface area comparison) were observed."

Subjects in these two trials ranged from 10 to 65 years of age, were approximately 52% female, 48% male, and were 74% Caucasian, 15% Black or African American, 3% Asian, and 8% Other. Efficacy results at Week 12 are presented in Table 3. Success on the 6-point Global Severity Score is defined as a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (very mild).
