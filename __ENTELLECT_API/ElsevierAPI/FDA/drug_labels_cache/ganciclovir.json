Ganciclovir Injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir Injection Ganciclovir Injection solution Ganciclovir Injection solution must be diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: Sterile Solution of Ganciclovir Injection Instructions: a) Shake the vial b) Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed.b) Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Infusion Instructions: a) Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with Ganciclovir Injection: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer's Injection and Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. a) Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of Ganciclovir Injection, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir Injection, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 )) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations . Ganciclovir Injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/mcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/mcL. Ganciclovir Injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving Ganciclovir Injection Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Ganciclovir Injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/mcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/mcL. Ganciclovir Injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving Ganciclovir Injection solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving Ganciclovir Injection , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/mcL at the beginning of treatment . Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving Ganciclovir Injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/mcL at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir Injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended Ganciclovir Injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6) ] . Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir Injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity . Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir Injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, Ganciclovir Injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of Ganciclovir Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1 )]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir Injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir Injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir Injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] ."

Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of Ganciclovir Injection Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of Ganciclovir Injection and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 .

Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Ganciclovir Name of the Concomitant Drug Change in the Concentration of Ganciclovir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Imipenem-cilastatin Unknown Coadministration with imipenem-cilastatin is not recommended because generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Cyclosporine or amphotericin B Unknown Monitor renal function when Ganciclovir Injection is coadministered with cyclosporine or amphotericin B because of potential increase in serum creatinine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) \u2194 Ganciclovir (in patients with normal renal function) \u2194 MMF (in patients with normal renal function) Based on increased risk, patients should be monitored for hematological and renal toxicity. Other drugs associated with myelosuppression or nephrotoxicity (e.g., dapsone, doxorubicin, flucytosine, hydroxyurea, pentamidine, tacrolimus, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, vinblastine, vincristine and zidovudine) Unknown Because of potential for higher toxicity, coadministration with Ganciclovir Injection should be considered only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. Didanosine \u2194 Ganciclovir \u2191 Didanosine Patients should be closely monitored for didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis). Probenecid \u2191 Ganciclovir Ganciclovir Injection dose may need to be reduced. Monitor for evidence of ganciclovir toxicity. Imipenem-cilastatin: Seizures were reported in patients receiving ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Concomitant use is not recommended unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. (7) Cyclosporine or amphotericin B: When coadministered with ganciclovir, the risk of nephrotoxicity may be increased. Monitor renal function. (5.2, 7) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): When coadministered with ganciclovir, the risk of hematological and renal toxicity may be increased. Monitor for ganciclovir and MMF toxicity. (7) Other drugs associated with myelosuppression or nephrotoxicity: Due to potential for increased toxicity, such drugs should be considered for concomitant use with ganciclovir only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. (7) Didanosine: Ganciclovir coadministered with didanosine may increase didanosine levels. Monitor for didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis). (7) Probenecid: May increase ganciclovir levels.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of Ganciclovir Injection. (8.2) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data] . Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether Ganciclovir Injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50-90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Ganciclovir Injection because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir Injection Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of Ganciclovir Injection, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of Ganciclovir Injection, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Ganciclovir Injection at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility Ganciclovir Injection at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir Injection Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir Injection have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of Ganciclovir Injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data] . Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether Ganciclovir Injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50-90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology (12.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u2219hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir Injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir (Table 7). Table 7.

Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir Injection in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ].

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u00b5M (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u00b5M (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u00b5M (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo: Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10. Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir Injection. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11. Table 11.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u2219hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir Injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir (Table 7). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50-79 4 3.2-5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25-49 3 3-5 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 < 25 3 1.25-5 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session . Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir Injection in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ].

Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u00b5M (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u00b5M (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u00b5M (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo: Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10. Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir Injection. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11. Table 11.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in mice at the same mean drug exposure in humans as at the RHD (5 mg/kg). At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 mcg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 mcg/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. Immediately post-transplant, patients received Ganciclovir Injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection vs 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received Ganciclovir Injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir Injection, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant.

This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with Ganciclovir Injection solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with Ganciclovir Injection Trial ICM 1570: This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease.

Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. Prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients ( 2.4 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily, 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information \u2022 To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, Ganciclovir for Injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. \u2022 Do not administer Ganciclovir for Injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. \u2022 The recommended dosage and infusion rate for Ganciclovir for Injection should not be exceeded. \u2022 Do not administer the reconstituted Ganciclovir for Injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description 11 ]. \u2022 Administration of Ganciclovir for Injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment \u2022 Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . \u2022 Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom Ganciclovir for Injection or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection solution to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for the Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of Ganciclovir for Injection for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment * Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below. Creatinine Clearance* (mL/min) GANCICLOVIR Induction Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Induction Ganciclovir Maintenance Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Maintenance Greater than or equal to 70 5 12 5 24 50-69 2.5 12 2.5 24 25-49 2.5 24 1.25 24 10-24 1.25 24 0.625 24 Less than 10 1.25 3 times per week, following hemodialysis 0.625 3 times per week, following hemodialysis Creatinine clearance for males = (140 - age [yrs]) (body wt [kg]) (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 \u00d7 male value Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis Induction dosing for Ganciclovir for Injection in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir for Injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir for Injection Ganciclovir for Injection must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: 1. Reconstitution Instructions: a) Reconstitute lyophilized Ganciclovir for Injection by injecting 10 mL of sterile water for injection, USP, into the vial. Do not use bacteriostatic water for injection containing parabens. It is incompatible with Ganciclovir for Injection and may cause precipitation. b) Gently swirl the vial in order to ensure complete wetting of the product. Continue swirling until a clear reconstituted solution is obtained. c) Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. d) Reconstituted solution in the vial is stable at room temperature (25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F)) for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. 2. Infusion Instructions: a) Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with Ganciclovir for Injection solution: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer's Injection and Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. b) Ganciclovir for Injection, when reconstituted with sterile water for injection (nonbacteriostatic) and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection. Solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with Ganciclovir for Injection solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs. 1 Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of Ganciclovir for Injection, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir for Injection, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with Ganciclovir for Injection. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Ganciclovir for Injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/\u03bcL. Ganciclovir for Injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving Ganciclovir for Injection solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving Ganciclovir for Injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir for Injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )] . Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir for Injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, Ganciclovir for Injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of Ganciclovir for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir for Injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir for Injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-5517176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least 20% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, nausea, anemia, asthenia, headache, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea, abdominal pain, sepsis, hyperhidrosis, and blood creatinine increased. Selected adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials of Ganciclovir for Injection are summarized below, according to the participating study patient population. Adverse Reactions in Patients with CMV Retinitis: Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing Ganciclovir for Injection and ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, Ganciclovir for Injection or ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse reactions. Selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported during the conduct of these controlled trials are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3 , respectively [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of Ganciclovir for Injection and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Table 6. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Ganciclovir for Injection Name of the Concomitant Drug Change in the Concentration of Ganciclovir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Imipenem-cilastatin Unknown Coadministration with imipenem-cilastatin is not recommended because generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Cyclosporine or amphotericin B Unknown Monitor renal function when Ganciclovir is coadministered with cyclosporine or amphotericin B because of potential increase in serum creatinine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) \u2194 Ganciclovir (in patients with normal renal function) \u2194 MMF (in patients with normal renal function) Based on increased risk, patients should be monitored for hematological and renal toxicity.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of Ganciclovir for Injection. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ] . Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether Ganciclovir for Injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50-90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data ]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Ganciclovir because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of Ganciclovir, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Ganciclovir at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of Ganciclovir were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of Ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, Ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering Ganciclovir to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50-90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] ."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of Ganciclovir were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of Ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, Ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50\u201379 4 3.2\u20135 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25\u201349 3 3\u20135 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25\u20135 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo: Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist. CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50\u201379 4 3.2\u20135 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25\u201349 3 3\u20135 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25\u20135 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo. In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo: Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10.

CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micro nucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 \u03bcg/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with Ganciclovir solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with Ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing Ganciclovir for injection to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , and are discussed below.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either Ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774: In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with Ganciclovir solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with Ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [-24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034: In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with Ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or Ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and IV formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints.

Trial ICM 1496: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir. Immediately post-transplant, patients received Ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir vs 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1689: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received Ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with Ganciclovir vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1570: This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with Ganciclovir solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with Ganciclovir and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with Ganciclovir, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hematologic Toxicity Inform patients that Ganciclovir may cause hematologic toxicity, including granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Inform patients that their blood counts and platelet counts should be closely monitored while on treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Impairment of Renal Function Inform patients that Ganciclovir has been associated with decreased renal function and that serum creatinine or creatinine clearance should be monitored while on treatment to allow for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Impairment of Fertility Inform patients that Ganciclovir may cause temporary or permanent infertility in humans [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Pregnancy and Contraception Advise female patients to use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir. Similarly, advise men to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . Carcinogenicity Inform patients that Ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Drug Interactions Inform patients that Ganciclovir may interact with other drugs. Advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Impairment of Cognitive Ability Based on the adverse reaction profile, ganciclovir may affect cognitive abilities, including the ability to drive and operate machinery, as seizures, dizziness, and/or confusion have been reported with the use of Ganciclovir [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.1 )] . Ophthalmological Examination in Patients with CMV Retinitis Inform patients that Ganciclovir is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and they may continue to experience progression of retinitis during or following treatment.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ganciclovir for injection is administered only intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Treatment of CMV retinitis ( 2.3 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. Prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients ( 2.4 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily, 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post- transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, ganciclovir for injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. Do not administer ganciclovir for injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. The recommended dosage and infusion rate for ganciclovir should not be exceeded. Do not administer the reconstituted ganciclovir for injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description ( 11 )]. Administration of ganciclovir for injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with ganciclovir and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with ganciclovir solution to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for the Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of ganciclovir for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance* (mL/min) Ganciclovir Induction Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Induction Ganciclovir Maintenance Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Maintenance Greater than or equal to 70 5 12 5 24 50 to 69 2.5 12 2.5 24 25 to 49 2.5 24 1.25 24 10 to 24 1.25 24 0.625 24 Less than 10 1.25 3 times per week, following hemodialysis 0.625 3 times per week, following hemodialysis * Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below. Creatinine clearance for males = (140 - age [yrs]) (body wt [kg]) (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 x male value Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis Induction dosing for ganciclovir in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir for Injection Ganciclovir for injection must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: Reconstitution Instructions: Reconstitute lyophilized ganciclovir for injection by injecting 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, into the vial. Do not use bacteriostatic water for injection containing parabens. It is incompatible with ganciclovir for injection and may cause precipitation. Gently swirl the vial in order to ensure complete wetting of the product. Continue swirling until a clear reconstituted solution is obtained. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Reconstituted solution in the vial is stable at room temperature (25\u00b0 C (77\u00b0 F) for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. Infusion Instructions: Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with ganciclovir for injection solution: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer\u2019s Injection and Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Ganciclovir for injection, when reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (non-bacteriostatic) and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of ganciclovir. Solutions of ganciclovir are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with ganciclovir solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs 1 [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution.",

Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with ganciclovir solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs 1 [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of ganciclovir, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with ganciclovir, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with ganciclovir. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Ganciclovir is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/mL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/mL. Ganciclovir should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving ganciclovir solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving ganciclovir [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/mL at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )] . Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with ganciclovir is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ] . 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, ganciclovir at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of ganciclovir [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] .",

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of ganciclovir and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Table 6.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of ganciclovir ( 8.2 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data] . Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ganciclovir because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 ), Nonclinical toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of ganciclovir, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Ganciclovir at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline, whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of ganciclovir for injection have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering ganciclovir to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of ganciclovir have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir for injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir (Table 7). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50 to 79 25 to 49 <25 4 3 3 3.2 to 5 mg/kg 3 to 5 mg/kg 1.25 to 5 mg/kg 128 + 63 57 + 8 30 + 13 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 4.4 + 0.4 10.7 + 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session . Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u00b5M (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u00b5M (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow- derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u00b5M (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo : Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10. Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696 to 742) and III (codons 805 to 845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11. Table 11.

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir for injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir (Table 7). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50 to 79 25 to 49 <25 4 3 3 3.2 to 5 mg/kg 3 to 5 mg/kg 1.25 to 5 mg/kg 128 + 63 57 + 8 30 + 13 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 4.4 + 0.4 10.7 + 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session . Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Tables 8 and Table 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo . In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u00b5M (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u00b5M (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow- derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u00b5M (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo : Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10. Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696 to 742) and III (codons 805 to 845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11. Table 11.

At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 mg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 mg/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of ganciclovir for injection 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing ganciclovir for injection to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1, 2, and 3, and are discussed below.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774: In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [\u00ad 24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034: In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with ganciclovir for injection, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily or ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and IV formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints.

Trial ICM 1496: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with ganciclovir. Immediately post-transplant, patients received ganciclovir for injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with ganciclovir vs 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1689: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with ganciclovir following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received ganciclovir for injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with ganciclovir vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with ganciclovir. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with ganciclovir vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post- transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with ganciclovir, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with ganciclovir [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Trial ICM 1570: This was a randomized, unblinded study evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with ganciclovir and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with ganciclovir, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689.",
      "14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of ganciclovir for injection 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing ganciclovir for injection to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1, 2, and 3, and are discussed below.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy.

Trial ICM 1774: In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [\u00ad 24, 0].

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hematologic Toxicity Inform patients that ganciclovir may cause hematologic toxicity, including granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Inform patients that their blood counts and platelet counts should be closely monitored while on treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Impairment of Renal Function Inform patients that ganciclovir has been associated with decreased renal function and that serum creatinine or creatinine clearance should be monitored while on treatment to allow for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Impairment of Fertility Inform patients that ganciclovir may cause temporary or permanent infertility in humans [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Pregnancy and Contraception Advise female patients to use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir. Similarly, advise men to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . Carcinogenicity Inform patients that ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Drug Interactions Inform patients that ganciclovir may interact with other drugs. Advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Impairment of Cognitive Ability Based on the adverse reaction profile, ganciclovir may affect cognitive abilities including the ability to drive and operate machinery, as seizures, dizziness, and/or confusion have been reported with the use of ganciclovir [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.1 )]. Ophthalmological Examination in Patients with CMV Retinitis Inform patients that ganciclovir is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and they may continue to experience progression of retinitis during or following treatment. Advise patients to have frequent ophthalmological follow-up examinations while being treated with ganciclovir. Some patients may require more frequent ophthalmological follow-up [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Lactation Advise nursing mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ganciclovir because of the potential for serious adverse events in nursing infants and because HIV can be passed to the baby in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ganciclovir for injection is administered only intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Treatment of CMV retinitis ( 2.3 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. Prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients ( 2.4 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) once daily, 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ). 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, ganciclovir for injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over one hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. Do not administer ganciclovir for injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. The recommended dosage and infusion rate for ganciclovir should not be exceeded. Do not administer the reconstituted ganciclovir for injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description (11) ]. Administration of ganciclovir should be accompanied by adequate hydration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with ganciclovir and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with ganciclovir solution to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for the Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over one hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of ganciclovir for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below. (mL/min) Ganciclovir Induction Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Induction Ganciclovir Maintenance Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Maintenance Greater than or equal to 70 5 12 5 24 50 to 69 2.5 12 2.5 24 25 to 49 2.5 24 1.25 24 10 to 24 1.25 24 0.625 24 Less than 10 1.25 3 times per week, following hemodialysis 0.625 3 times per week, following hemodialysis Creatinine clearance for males = (140 - age [yrs]) (body wt [kg]) (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 \u00d7 male value Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis Induction dosing for ganciclovir in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir for Injection Ganciclovir for injection must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: Reconstitution Instructions: a) Reconstitute lyophilized ganciclovir for injection by injecting 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, into the vial. Do not use bacteriostatic water for injection containing parabens. It is incompatible with ganciclovir for injection and may cause precipitation. b) Gently swirl the vial in order to ensure complete wetting of the product. Continue swirling until a clear reconstituted solution is obtained. c) Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. d) Reconstituted solution in the vial is stable at room temperature (25\u00b0C) for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Infusion Instructions: a) Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of one hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with ganciclovir for injection solution: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer's Injection and Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. b) Ganciclovir for injection, when reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (non-bacteriostatic) and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of ganciclovir. Solutions of ganciclovir are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with ganciclovir solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs 1 [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of ganciclovir, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with ganciclovir, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, have been observed in patients treated with ganciclovir. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Ganciclovir is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/\u00b5L, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/\u00b5L. Ganciclovir should also be used with caution in patients with preexisting cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving ganciclovir solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving ganciclovir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u00b5L at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6) ]. Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with ganciclovir is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, ganciclovir at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of ganciclovir [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of ganciclovir and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 6. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Ganciclovir Name of the Concomitant Drug Change in the Concentration of Ganciclovir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Imipenem-cilastatin Unknown Coadministration with imipenem\u00ad-cilastatin is not recommended because generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Cyclosporine or amphotericin B Unknown Monitor renal function when ganciclovir is coadministered with cyclosporine or amphotericin B because of potential increase in serum creatinine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) \u2194 Ganciclovir (in patients with normal renal function) \u2194 MMF (in patients with normal renal function) Based on increased risk, patients should be monitored for hematological and renal toxicity. Other drugs associated with myelosuppresion or nephrotoxicity (e.g., dapsone, doxorubicin, flucytosine, hydroxyurea, pentamidine, tacrolimus, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole, vinblastine, vincristine and zidovudine) Unknown Because of potential for higher toxicity, coadministration with ganciclovir should be considered only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. Didanosine \u2194 Ganciclovir \u2191 Didanosine Patients should be closely monitored for didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis). Probenecid \u2191 Ganciclovir Ganciclovir dose may need to be reduced. Monitor for evidence of ganciclovir toxicity. Imipenem-cilastatin: Seizures were reported in patients receiving ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Concomitant use is not recommended unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. ( 7 ) Cyclosporine or amphotericin B: When coadministered with ganciclovir, the risk of nephrotoxicity may be increased. Monitor renal function. ( 5.2 , 7 ) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): When coadministered with ganciclovir, the risk of hematological and renal toxicity may be increased. Monitor for ganciclovir and MMF toxicity. ( 7 ) Other drugs associated with myelosuppression or nephrotoxicity: Due to potential for increased toxicity, such drugs should be considered for concomitant use with ganciclovir only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. ( 7 ) Didanosine: Ganciclovir coadministered with didanosine may increase didanosine levels. Monitor for didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis). ( 7 ) Probenecid: May increase ganciclovir levels.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of ganciclovir. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ]. Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data ]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ganciclovir because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of ganciclovir, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Ganciclovir at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of ganciclovir have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and ten pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n = 14) and 6 mg/kg (n = 13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering ganciclovir to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of ganciclovir have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ]. Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of ganciclovir have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and ten pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n = 14) and 6 mg/kg (n = 13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Reports of adverse reactions after overdoses with ganciclovir, some with fatal outcomes, have been received from clinical trials and during postmarketing experience. One or more of the following adverse reactions has been reported with overdoses: Hematological toxicity: myelosuppression including pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow failure Hepatotoxicity: hepatitis, liver function disorder Renal toxicity: worsening of hematuria in a patient with preexisting renal impairment, acute kidney injury, elevated creatinine Gastrointestinal toxicity: abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting Neurotoxicity: seizure Since ganciclovir is dialyzable, dialysis may be useful in reducing serum concentrations in patients who have received an overdose of ganciclovir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Adequate hydration should be maintained. The use of hematopoietic growth factors should be considered in patients with cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a one hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n = 16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n = 16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n = 16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n = 16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n = 98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n = 4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n = 98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n = 47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n = 47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n = 98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir for injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50 to 79 25 to 49 <25 4 3 3 3.2 to 5 mg/kg 3 to 5 mg/kg 1.25 to 5 mg/kg 128 + 63 57 + 8 30 + 13 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 4.4 + 0.4 10.7 + 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Table 8 and Table 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir. Table 8 provides the effects of coadministered drug on ganciclovir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas Table 9 provides the effects of ganciclovir on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministered drug.

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u00b5M (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u00b5M (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u00b5M (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo : Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and two of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a one hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n = 16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n = 16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n = 16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n = 16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n = 98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n = 4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n = 98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n = 47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n = 47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n = 98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir for injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50 to 79 25 to 49 <25 4 3 3 3.2 to 5 mg/kg 3 to 5 mg/kg 1.25 to 5 mg/kg 128 + 63 57 + 8 30 + 13 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 4.4 + 0.4 10.7 + 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ].

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo . In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u00b5M (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u00b5M (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u00b5M (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo : Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and two of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in mice at the same mean drug exposure in humans as at the RHD (5 mg/kg). At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 \u00b5g/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs. 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of ganciclovir for injection 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing ganciclovir for injection to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1, 2, and 3, and are discussed below. Table 12.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774: In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [-24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034: In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with ganciclovir for injection, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir for injection solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and IV formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints.

Trial ICM 1496: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with ganciclovir. Immediately post-transplant, patients received ganciclovir for injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with ganciclovir vs. 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Trial ICM 1689: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with ganciclovir following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received ganciclovir for injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with ganciclovir vs. 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with ganciclovir. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with ganciclovir vs. 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with ganciclovir, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with ganciclovir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Trial ICM 1570: This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with ganciclovir for injection solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with ganciclovir and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with ganciclovir, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ganciclovir Injection is administered only intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Treatment of CMV retinitis ( 2.3 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. Prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients ( 2.4 ) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily, 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post- transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, Ganciclovir Injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. Do not administer Ganciclovir Injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. The recommended dosage and infusion rate for Ganciclovir Injection should not be exceeded. Do not administer the reconstituted Ganciclovir Injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description ( 11 )]. Administration of Ganciclovir Injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom Ganciclovir Injection or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/mcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with Ganciclovir Injection and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with Ganciclovir Injection solution to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir Injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir Injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for the Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir Injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir Injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of Ganciclovir Injection for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment * Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below. Creatinine Clearance* (mL/min) Ganciclovir Injection Induction Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Induction Ganciclovir Injection Maintenance Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Maintenance Greater than or equal to 70 5 12 5 24 50 to 69 2.5 12 2.5 24 25 to 49 2.5 24 1.25 24 10 to 24 1.25 24 0.625 24 Less than 10 1.25 3 times per week, following hemodialysis 0.625 3 times per week, following hemodialysis Creatinine clearance for males = (140 - age [yrs]) (body wt [kg]) (72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) Creatinine clearance for females = 0.85 x male value Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis Induction dosing for Ganciclovir Injection in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir Injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir Injection Ganciclovir Injection solution must be diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: Sterile Solution of Ganciclovir Injection Instructions: a) Shake the vial b) Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Infusion Instructions: a) Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg per mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg per mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with Ganciclovir Injection: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer's Injection and Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. b) Ganciclovir Injection, when further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of Ganciclovir Injection. Solutions of Ganciclovir Injection are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with Ganciclovir Injection solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs 1 . Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of Ganciclovir Injection, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir Injection, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Ganciclovir Injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/mcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/mcL. Ganciclovir Injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving Ganciclovir Injection solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving Ganciclovir Injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/mcL at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir Injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )] . Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir Injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, Ganciclovir Injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of Ganciclovir Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir Injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir Injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] ."

The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least 20% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, nausea, anemia, asthenia, headache, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea, abdominal pain, sepsis, hyperhidrosis, and blood creatinine increased. Selected adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials of Ganciclovir Injection are summarized below, according to the participating study patient population. Adverse Reactions in Patients with CMV Retinitis: Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing Ganciclovir Injection and ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, Ganciclovir Injection or ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse reactions.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of Ganciclovir Injection and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of Ganciclovir Injection. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ] . Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether Ganciclovir Injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data ]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Ganciclovir Injection because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of Ganciclovir Injection, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Ganciclovir Injection at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir Injection have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of Ganciclovir Injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of Ganciclovir Injection in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ganciclovir Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir Injection is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, Ganciclovir Injection should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering Ganciclovir Injection to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir Injection have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b13.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir Injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50 to 79 4 3.2 to 5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25 to 49 3 3 to 5 mg/kg 57 \u00b18 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 < 25 3 1.25 to 5 mg/kg 30 \u00b113 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir Injection in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] .

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow- derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo : Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir Injection. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b13.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir Injection solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50 to 79 4 3.2 to 5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25 to 49 3 3 to 5 mg/kg 57 \u00b18 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 < 25 3 1.25 to 5 mg/kg 30 \u00b113 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir Injection in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] .

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo . In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow- derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo : Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir Injection. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 mcg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 mcg/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with Ganciclovir Injection solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of Ganciclovir Injection 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with Ganciclovir Injection was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing Ganciclovir Injection to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , and are discussed below.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either Ganciclovir Injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - intravenous) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774: In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with Ganciclovir Injection solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with Ganciclovir Injection solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - intravenous) was -12 days [-24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034: In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with Ganciclovir Injection, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or Ganciclovir Injection solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - intravenous) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and intravenous formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints.

Trial ICM 1496: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. Immediately post-transplant, patients received Ganciclovir Injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection vs 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1689: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received Ganciclovir Injection solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir Injection, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir Injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1570: This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with Ganciclovir Injection solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with Ganciclovir Injection and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with Ganciclovir Injection, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hematologic Toxicity Inform patients that Ganciclovir Injection may cause hematologic toxicity, including granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Inform patients that their blood counts and platelet counts should be closely monitored while on treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Impairment of Renal Function Inform patients that Ganciclovir Injection has been associated with decreased renal function and that serum creatinine or creatinine clearance should be monitored while on treatment to allow for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Impairment of Fertility Inform patients that Ganciclovir Injection may cause temporary or permanent infertility in humans [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Pregnancy and Contraception Advise female patients to use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection. Similarly, advise men to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir Injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . Carcinogenicity Inform patients that Ganciclovir Injection should be considered a potential carcinogen [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Drug Interactions Inform patients that Ganciclovir Injection may interact with other drugs. Advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Impairment of Cognitive Ability Based on the adverse reaction profile, ganciclovir may affect cognitive abilities, including the ability to drive and operate machinery, as seizures, dizziness, and/or confusion have been reported with the use of Ganciclovir Injection [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.1 )] . Ophthalmological Examination in Patients with CMV Retinitis Inform patients that Ganciclovir Injection is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and they may continue to experience progression of retinitis during or following treatment. Advise patients to have frequent ophthalmological follow-up examinations while being treated with Ganciclovir Injection. Some patients may require more frequent ophthalmological follow-up [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Lactation Advise nursing mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving Ganciclovir Injection because of the potential for serious adverse events in nursing infants and because HIV can be passed to the baby in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )].

Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily, 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information \u2022 To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, Ganciclovir for Injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. \u2022 Do not administer Ganciclovir for Injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. \u2022 The recommended dosage and infusion rate for Ganciclovir for Injection should not be exceeded. \u2022 Do not administer the reconstituted Ganciclovir for Injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description 11 ]. \u2022 Administration of Ganciclovir for Injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration. \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment \u2022 Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . \u2022 Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom Ganciclovir for Injection or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection solution to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for the Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage: The recommended initial dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage: Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of Ganciclovir for Injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of Ganciclovir for Injection for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage for Adult Patients with Renal Impairment * Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below.

Ganciclovir for Injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir for Injection Ganciclovir for Injection must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: 1. Reconstitution Instructions: a) Reconstitute lyophilized Ganciclovir for Injection by injecting 10 mL of sterile water for injection, USP, into the vial. Do not use bacteriostatic water for injection containing parabens. It is incompatible with Ganciclovir for Injection and may cause precipitation. b) Gently swirl the vial in order to ensure complete wetting of the product. Continue swirling until a clear reconstituted solution is obtained. c) Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. d) Reconstituted solution in the vial is stable at room temperature (25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F)) for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. 2. Infusion Instructions: a) Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with Ganciclovir for Injection solution: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer's Injection and Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP. b) Ganciclovir for Injection, when reconstituted with sterile water for injection (non-bacteriostatic) and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection. Solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with Ganciclovir for Injection solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs. 1 Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of Ganciclovir for Injection, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir for Injection, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia have been observed in patients treated with Ganciclovir for Injection. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Ganciclovir for Injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/\u03bcL. Ganciclovir for Injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving Ganciclovir for Injection solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving Ganciclovir for Injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] , complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir for Injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )] . Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with Ganciclovir for Injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, Ganciclovir for Injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of Ganciclovir for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir for Injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir for Injection [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir for Injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] ."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least 20% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, nausea, anemia, asthenia, headache, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea, abdominal pain, sepsis, hyperhidrosis, and blood creatinine increased. Selected adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials of Ganciclovir for Injection are summarized below, according to the participating study patient population. Adverse Reactions in Patients with CMV Retinitis: Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing Ganciclovir for Injection and ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, Ganciclovir for Injection or ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse reactions. Selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported during the conduct of these controlled trials are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3 , respectively [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of Ganciclovir for Injection. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ] . Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether Ganciclovir for Injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50-90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data ]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Ganciclovir because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with Ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of Ganciclovir, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Infertility Ganciclovir at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of Ganciclovir were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of Ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, Ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering Ganciclovir to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of Ganciclovir have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u00b7hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50\u201379 4 3.2\u20135 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25\u201349 3 3\u20135 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25\u20135 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Drug Interaction Studies Table 8 and Table 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir. Table 8 provides the effects of coadministered drug on ganciclovir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas Table 9 provides the effects of ganciclovir on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministered drug.

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo: Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist. CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration. Specific Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of Ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7.

Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of Ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )].

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo. In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture: CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In vivo: Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10. Summary of Resistance-associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597-600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981-982, A987G Note: Many additional pathways to ganciclovir resistance likely exist. CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with Ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross-Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in mice at the same mean drug exposure in humans as at the RHD (5 mg/kg). At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micro nucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 \u03bcg/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. In the mouse micro nucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 \u03bcg/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with Ganciclovir solution resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of Ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with Ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing Ganciclovir for injection to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 and Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , and are discussed below. Table 12.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either Ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774: In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with Ganciclovir solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with Ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [-24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034: In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with Ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or Ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and IV formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints.

Trial ICM 1496: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir. Immediately post-transplant, patients received Ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir vs 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1689: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received Ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with Ganciclovir vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with Ganciclovir. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with Ganciclovir vs 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with Ganciclovir [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Trial ICM 1570: This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with Ganciclovir solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with Ganciclovir and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with Ganciclovir, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hematologic Toxicity Inform patients that Ganciclovir may cause hematologic toxicity, including granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Inform patients that their blood counts and platelet counts should be closely monitored while on treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Impairment of Renal Function Inform patients that Ganciclovir has been associated with decreased renal function and that serum creatinine or creatinine clearance should be monitored while on treatment to allow for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Impairment of Fertility Inform patients that Ganciclovir may cause temporary or permanent infertility in humans [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )] . Pregnancy and Contraception Advise female patients to use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days following treatment with Ganciclovir. Similarly, advise men to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with Ganciclovir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . Carcinogenicity Inform patients that Ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Drug Interactions Inform patients that Ganciclovir may interact with other drugs. Advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Impairment of Cognitive Ability Based on the adverse reaction profile, ganciclovir may affect cognitive abilities, including the ability to drive and operate machinery, as seizures, dizziness, and/or confusion have been reported with the use of Ganciclovir [see Adverse Reaction ( 6.1 )] . Ophthalmological Examination in Patients with CMV Retinitis Inform patients that Ganciclovir is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and they may continue to experience progression of retinitis during or following treatment. Advise patients to have frequent ophthalmological follow-up examinations while being treated with Ganciclovir. Some patients may require more frequent ophthalmological follow-up [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Lactation Advise nursing mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving Ganciclovir because of the potential for serious adverse events in nursing infants and because HIV can be passed to the baby in breast milk [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.2 )].

Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, ganciclovir for injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. Do not administer ganciclovir for injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. The recommended dosage and infusion rate for ganciclovir for injection should not be exceeded. Do not administer the reconstituted ganciclovir for injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description 11 ]. Administration of ganciclovir for injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with ganciclovir for injection and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with ganciclovir for injection to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir for injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir for injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of ganciclovir for injection for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below. (mL/min) Ganciclovir for Injection Induction Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Induction Ganciclovir for Injection Maintenance Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Maintenance Greater than or equal to 70 5 12 5 24 50-69 2.5 12 2.5 24 25-49 2.5 24 1.25 24 10-24 1.25 24 0.625 24 Less than 10 1.25 3 times per week, following hemodialysis 0.625 3 times per week, following hemodialysis Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis Induction dosing for ganciclovir for injection in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir for injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir Injection, USP Ganciclovir for Injection, USP must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: Reconstitution Instructions: Reconstitute lyophilized Ganciclovir for Injection, USP by injecting 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, into the vial. Do not use bacteriostatic water for injection containing parabens. It is incompatible with Ganciclovir for Injection, USP and may cause precipitation. Gently swirl the vial in order to ensure complete wetting of the product. Continue swirling until a clear reconstituted solution is obtained. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Reconstituted solution in the vial is stable at room temperature (25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F)) for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. Infusion Instructions: Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with Ganciclovir for Injection, USP solution: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer\u2019s Injection and Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Ganciclovir for Injection, USP, when reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (non-bacteriostatic) and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection, USP. Solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection, USP are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with Ganciclovir for Injection, USP solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs 1 . Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of ganciclovir, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with ganciclovir for injection, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, have been observed in patients treated with ganciclovir. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Ganciclovir for injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/\u03bcL. Ganciclovir for injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving ganciclovir solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving ganciclovir for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u00b5L at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir for injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with ganciclovir for injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, ganciclovir for injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of ganciclovir for injection [see Use in Specific Population (8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir for injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir for injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of ganciclovir for injection and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 6. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Ganciclovir Name of the Concomitant Drug Change in the Concentration of Ganciclovir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Imipenem-cilastatin Unknown Coadministration with imipenem-cilastatin is not recommended because generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Cyclosporine or amphotericin B Unknown Monitor renal function when ganciclovir for injection is coadministered with cyclosporine or amphotericin B because of potential increase in serum creatinine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) \u2194Ganciclovir (in patients with normal renal function) \u2194MMF (in patients with normal renal function) Based on increased risk, patients should be monitored for hematological and renal toxicity. Other drugs associated with myelosuppresion or nephrotoxicity (e.g., dapsone, doxorubicin, flucytosine, hydroxyurea, pentamidine, tacrolimus, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vinblastine, vincristine and zidovudine) Unknown Because of potential for higher toxicity, coadministration with ganciclovir for injection should be considered only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. Didanosine \u2194 Ganciclovir \u2191 Didanosine Patients should be closely monitored for didanosine toxicity (e.g., pancreatitis). Probenecid \u2191 Ganciclovir Ganciclovir for injection dose may need to be reduced. Monitor for evidence of ganciclovir toxicity. Imipenem-cilastatin: Seizures were reported in patients receiving ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Concomitant use is not recommended unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. ( 7 ) Cyclosporine or amphotericin B: When coadministered with ganciclovir, the risk of nephrotoxicity may be increased. Monitor renal function. ( 5.2 , 7 ) Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): When coadministered with ganciclovir, the risk of hematological and renal toxicity may be increased. Monitor for ganciclovir and MMF toxicity. ( 7 ) Other drugs associated with myelosuppression or nephrotoxicity: Due to potential for increased toxicity, such drugs should be considered for concomitant use with ganciclovir only if the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the risks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of Ganciclovir for Injection, USP. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ]. Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir for injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ganciclovir for injection because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of ganciclovir, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Ganciclovir for injection at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ganciclovir for injection have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of intravenous ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering ganciclovir for injection to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of ganciclovir have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ]. Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir for injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u2219hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration Special Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50-79 4 3.2-5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25-49 3 3-5 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25-5 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Tables 8 and 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir.

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In Vivo Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u2219hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration Special Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50-79 4 3.2-5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25-49 3 3-5 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25-5 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Tables 8 and 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir. Table 8 provides the effects of coadministered drug on ganciclovir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas Table 9 provides the effects of ganciclovir on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministered drug.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo . In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In Vivo Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10. Summary of Resistance-Associated Amino Acid Substitutions Observed in the CMV of Patients Failing Ganciclovir Treatment or Prophylaxis pUL97 L405P, A440V, M460I/V/T/L, V466G/M, C518Y, H520Q, P521L, del 590-593, A591D/V, C592G, A594E/G/T/V/P, L595F/S/T/W, del 595, del 595-603, E596D/G/Y, K599E/M, del 600-601, del 597\u2011600, del 601-603, C603W/R/S/Y, C607F/S/Y, I610T, A613V pUL54 E315D, N408D/K/S, F412C/L/S, D413A/E/N, L501F/I, T503I, K513E/N/R, D515E, L516W, I521T, P522A/L/S, V526L, C539G, L545S/W, Q578H/L, D588E/N, G629S, S695T, I726T/V, E756K, L773V, V781I, V787L, L802M, A809V, T813S, T821I, A834P, G841A/S, D879G, A972V, del 981\u2011982, A987G CMV resistance to ganciclovir has been observed in individuals with AIDS and CMV retinitis who have never received ganciclovir therapy. Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in mice at the same mean drug exposure in humans as at the RHD (5 mg/kg). At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 \u00b5g/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with intravenous ganciclovir resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs. 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with intravenous ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing intravenous ganciclovir to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 , and Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , and are discussed below.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either intravenous ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774 In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with intravenous ganciclovir solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with intravenous ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [-24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034 In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily or intravenous ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and IV formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints. Figure 1.

Trial ICM 1496 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Immediately post-transplant, patients received intravenous ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir vs. 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Trial ICM 1689 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received intravenous ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir vs. 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir vs. 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with intravenous ganciclovir, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with intravenous ganciclovir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Trial ICM 1570 This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with intravenous ganciclovir solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with intravenous ganciclovir, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ganciclovir for Injection, USP is administered only intravenously. ( 2.1 ) Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Treatment of CMV retinitis (2.3) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. Prevention of CMV disease in transplant recipients (2.4) Induction: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance: 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. Adults with renal impairment: Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Dosing and Administration Information To avoid phlebitis/pain at the infusion site, ganciclovir for injection must only be administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour, preferably via plastic cannula, into a vein with adequate blood flow to permit rapid dilution and distribution. Do not administer ganciclovir for injection by rapid or bolus intravenous injection which may increase toxicity as a result of excessive plasma levels. The recommended dosage and infusion rate for ganciclovir for injection should not be exceeded. Do not administer the reconstituted ganciclovir for injection solution intramuscularly or subcutaneously because it may result in severe tissue irritation due to high pH [see Description 11 ]. Administration of ganciclovir for injection should be accompanied by adequate hydration. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.2 Testing Before and During Treatment Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. Complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in cytopenias, or in whom absolute neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. All patients should be monitored for renal function before and during treatment with ganciclovir for injection and dose should be adjusted as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Patients with CMV retinitis should have frequent ophthalmological examinations during treatment with ganciclovir for injection to monitor disease status and for other retinal abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Treatment of CMV Retinitis in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 14 to 21 days. Maintenance Dosage Following induction treatment, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir for injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week. 2.4 Recommended Dosage for Prevention of CMV Disease in Adult Transplant Recipients with Normal Renal Function Induction Dosage The recommended initial dosage of ganciclovir for injection for patients with normal renal function is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. Maintenance Dosage Following induction, the recommended maintenance dosage of ganciclovir for injection is 5 mg/kg (given intravenously at a constant rate over 1 hour) once daily for 7 days per week, or 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days per week until 100 to 120 days post-transplantation. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment For patients with impairment of renal function, refer to Table 1 for recommended doses of ganciclovir for injection for induction and maintenance dosage for treatment of CMV retinitis and prevention of CMV disease in recipients. Carefully monitor serum creatinine or creatinine clearance before and during treatment to allow for dosage adjustments in patients with impaired renal function. Table 1. Recommended Induction and Maintenance Dosage in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance Creatinine clearance can be related to serum creatinine by the formulas given below. (mL/min) Ganciclovir for Injection Induction Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Induction Ganciclovir for Injection Maintenance Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) for Maintenance Greater than or equal to 70 5 12 5 24 50-69 2.5 12 2.5 24 25-49 2.5 24 1.25 24 10-24 1.25 24 0.625 24 Less than 10 1.25 3 times per week, following hemodialysis 0.625 3 times per week, following hemodialysis Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis Induction dosing for ganciclovir for injection in patients undergoing hemodialysis should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg 3 times per week; and maintenance dosing should not exceed 0.625 mg/kg 3 times per week following each hemodialysis session. Ganciclovir for injection should be given shortly after completion of the hemodialysis session, since hemodialysis has been shown to reduce plasma levels by approximately 50% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.6 Preparation of Ganciclovir Injection, USP Ganciclovir for Injection, USP must be reconstituted and diluted under the supervision of a healthcare provider and administered as intravenous infusion. Each 10 mL clear glass vial contains 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended during reconstitution and when wiping the outer surface of the vial and the table after reconstitution. The contents of the vial should be prepared for administration in the following manner: Reconstitution Instructions: Reconstitute lyophilized Ganciclovir for Injection, USP by injecting 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, into the vial. Do not use bacteriostatic water for injection containing parabens. It is incompatible with Ganciclovir for Injection, USP and may cause precipitation. Gently swirl the vial in order to ensure complete wetting of the product. Continue swirling until a clear reconstituted solution is obtained. Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to proceeding with infusion. Discard the vial if particulate matter or discoloration is observed. Reconstituted solution in the vial is stable at room temperature (25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F)) for 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. Infusion Instructions: Based on patient weight, the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (ganciclovir concentration 50 mg/mL) should be removed from the vial and added to an acceptable infusion fluid (typically 100 mL) for delivery over the course of 1 hour. Infusion concentrations greater than 10 mg/mL are not recommended. The following infusion fluids have been determined to be chemically and physically compatible with Ganciclovir for Injection, USP solution: 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 5% Dextrose, Ringer\u2019s Injection and Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP. Ganciclovir for Injection, USP, when reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (non-bacteriostatic) and further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or other acceptable infusion fluid as specified above, should be used within 24 hours of dilution to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. The diluted infusion solution should be refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F)). Do not freeze. 2.7 Handling and Disposal Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection, USP. Solutions of Ganciclovir for Injection, USP are alkaline (pH 11). Avoid direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with Ganciclovir for Injection, USP solution. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes thoroughly with plain water. Wearing disposable gloves is recommended. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs 1 . Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment: Increased serum creatinine levels have been observed with the use of ganciclovir, particularly in elderly patients and transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function during therapy with ganciclovir for injection, particularly in elderly patients and in patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs, and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. (5.2) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, have been observed in patients treated with ganciclovir. The frequency and severity of these events vary widely in different patient populations [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Ganciclovir for injection is not recommended if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/\u03bcL, hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL, or the platelet count is less than 25,000 cells/\u03bcL. Ganciclovir for injection should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Granulocytopenia (neutropenia) usually occurs during the first or second week of treatment but may occur at any time during treatment. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. Colony-stimulating factors have been shown to increase neutrophil and white blood cell counts in patients receiving ganciclovir solution for treatment of CMV retinitis. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving ganciclovir for injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently in all patients, especially in patients with renal impairment and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u00b5L at the beginning of treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.2 Renal Impairment Ganciclovir for injection should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because the half-life and plasma/serum concentrations of ganciclovir will be increased due to reduced renal clearance. If renal function is impaired, dosage adjustments are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Increased serum creatinine levels have been reported in elderly patients and in transplant recipients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications (i.e., cyclosporine and amphotericin B). Monitoring renal function during therapy with ganciclovir for injection is essential, especially for elderly patients and those patients receiving concomitant agents that may cause nephrotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, ganciclovir for injection at the recommended human dose (RHD) may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with the use of ganciclovir for injection [see Use in Specific Population (8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir for injection may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. Systemic exposure of ganciclovir in animals at approximately 2 times the RHD caused fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes in animals included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly and brachygnathia. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection. Similarly, men should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Ganciclovir for injection should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Slate Run Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-888-341-9214 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least 20% of patients were pyrexia, diarrhea, leukopenia, nausea, anemia, asthenia, headache, cough, decreased appetite, dyspnea, abdominal pain, sepsis, hyperhidrosis, and blood creatinine increased. Selected adverse reactions that occurred during clinical trials of ganciclovir are summarized below, according to the participating study patient population. Adverse Reactions in Patients with CMV Retinitis Three controlled, randomized, phase 3 trials comparing intravenous ganciclovir and ganciclovir capsules for maintenance treatment of CMV retinitis have been completed. During these trials, intravenous ganciclovir or ganciclovir capsules were prematurely discontinued in 9% of subjects because of adverse reactions. Selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported during the conduct of these controlled trials are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3 , respectively [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ].

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug-drug interaction studies were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug following concomitant administration of ganciclovir for injection and drugs excreted by the same pathway as ganciclovir. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 6 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 6. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Ganciclovir Name of the Concomitant Drug Change in the Concentration of Ganciclovir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment Imipenem-cilastatin Unknown Coadministration with imipenem-cilastatin is not recommended because generalized seizures have been reported in patients who received ganciclovir and imipenem-cilastatin. Cyclosporine or amphotericin B Unknown Monitor renal function when ganciclovir for injection is coadministered with cyclosporine or amphotericin B because of potential increase in serum creatinine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended with use of Ganciclovir for Injection, USP. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ]. Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir for injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk Most maternal CMV infections are asymptomatic or they may be associated with a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ganciclovir for injection because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV. Data Animal Data Ganciclovir administered intravenously (at 0.13 mg/h) to lactating rats (on lactation day 15) resulted in passive transfer into milk. The milk-to-serum ratio for ganciclovir at steady state was 1.6 \u00b1 0.33. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Females of reproductive potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Females Because of the mutagenic and teratogenic potential of ganciclovir, females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4 ), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Males Because of its mutagenic potential, males should be advised to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Infertility Ganciclovir for injection at the recommended doses may cause temporary or permanent female and male infertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Data Human Data In a small, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, adult male renal transplant patients receiving valganciclovir (the prodrug of ganciclovir) for CMV prophylaxis for up to 200 days post-transplantation were compared to an untreated control group. Patients were followed-up for six months after valganciclovir discontinuation. Among 24 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density at the end of treatment visit decreased by 11 million/mL from baseline; whereas, among 14 evaluable patients in the control group the mean sperm density increased by 33 million/mL. However, at the follow-up visit among 20 evaluable patients in the valganciclovir group, the mean sperm density was comparable to that observed among 10 evaluable patients in the untreated control group (the mean sperm density at the end of follow-up visit increased by 41 million/mL from baseline in the valganciclovir group and by 43 million/mL in the untreated group). 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ganciclovir for injection have not been established in pediatric patients. A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg). The steady-state volume of distribution was 0.64 \u00b1 0.22 L/kg, C max was 7.9 \u00b1 3.9 mcg/mL, systemic clearance was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 was 2.4 \u00b1 0.7 hours. Although the pharmacokinetics of intravenous ganciclovir in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults, the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir at these exposures in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Dose reduction is recommended when administering ganciclovir for injection to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and efficacy of ganciclovir have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment."

However, in immunocompromised patients (i.e., transplant patients or patients with AIDS), CMV infections may be symptomatic and may result in significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The transmission of CMV to the fetus is a result of maternal viremia and transplacental infection. Perinatal infection can also occur from exposure of the neonate to CMV shedding in the genital tract. Approximately 10% of children with congenital CMV infection are symptomatic at birth. Mortality in symptomatic infants is about 10% and approximately 50 to 90% of symptomatic surviving newborns experience significant morbidity, including mental retardation, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, seizures, and other medical problems. The risk of congenital CMV infection resulting from primary maternal CMV infection may be higher and of greater severity than that resulting from maternal reactivation of CMV infection. Data Animal Data Daily intravenous doses of ganciclovir were administered to pregnant mice (108 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (60 mg/kg/day), and also to female mice (90 mg/kg) prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85% of rabbits and mice. Additional effects observed in rabbits included fetal growth retardation, embryolethality, teratogenicity, and/or maternal toxicity. Teratogenic changes included cleft palate, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, aplastic organs (kidney and pancreas), hydrocephaly, and brachygnathia. In pre/postnatal development studies in mice, there were maternal/fetal toxicity and embryolethality which included fetal effects of hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the male offspring, as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach. The systemic exposure (AUC) of ganciclovir during these studies was approximately 2 times (pregnant mice and rabbits) and 1.7 times (pre/postnatal mice) the exposure in humans at the RHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]."

      "Risk Summary In animal studies, ganciclovir caused maternal and fetal toxicity and embryo-fetal mortality in pregnant mice and rabbits as well as teratogenicity in rabbits at exposures two times the exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) [see Data ]. Although placental transfer of ganciclovir has been shown to occur based on ex vivo experiments with human placenta and in at least one case report in a pregnant woman, no adequate human data are available to establish whether ganciclovir for injection poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.",
      "Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ganciclovir in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. When ganciclovir was administered to lactating rats, ganciclovir was present in milk [see Data]. Advise nursing mothers that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ganciclovir for injection because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid potential postnatal transmission of HIV."

A total of 120 pediatric patients with serious CMV infections participated in clinical trials. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir after administration of ganciclovir for injection were studied in 27 neonates (aged 2 to 49 days) and 10 pediatric patients, aged 9 months to 12 years. In neonates, the pharmacokinetic parameters after ganciclovir intravenous doses of 4 mg/kg (n=14) and 6 mg/kg (n=13) were C max 5.5 \u00b1 1.6 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 mcg/mL, systemic clearance 3.14 \u00b1 1.75 and 3.56 \u00b1 1.27 mL/min/kg, and t 1/2 of 2.4 hours (harmonic mean) for both doses, respectively. In pediatric patients 9 months to 12 years of age, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ganciclovir were the same after single and multiple (every 12 hours) intravenous doses (5 mg/kg).

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ganciclovir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Ganciclovir is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because renal clearance decreases with age, ganciclovir should be administered to elderly patients with special consideration of their renal status. Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments should be made accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is an antiviral drug with activity against CMV [see Microbiology (12.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u2219hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration Special Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50-79 4 3.2-5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25-49 3 3-5 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25-5 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Tables 8 and 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir. Table 8 provides the effects of coadministered drug on ganciclovir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas Table 9 provides the effects of ganciclovir on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministered drug.

In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In Vivo Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption At the end of a 1-hour intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg ganciclovir, total AUC ranged between 22.1 \u00b1 3.2 (n=16) and 26.8 \u00b1 6.1 mcg\u2219hr/mL (n=16) and C max ranged between 8.27 \u00b1 1.02 (n=16) and 9.0 \u00b1 1.4 mcg/mL (n=16). Distribution The steady-state volume of distribution of ganciclovir after intravenous administration was 0.74 \u00b1 0.15 L/kg (n=98). Ganciclovir diffuses across the placenta. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtained 0.25 to 5.67 hours post-dose in 3 patients who received 2.5 mg/kg ganciclovir intravenously every 8 hours or every 12 hours ranged from 0.31 to 0.68 mcg/mL, representing 24% to 70% of the respective plasma concentrations. Binding to plasma proteins was 1% to 2% over ganciclovir concentrations of 0.5 and 51 mcg/mL. Elimination When administered intravenously, ganciclovir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 1.6 to 5.0 mg/kg. Renal excretion of unchanged drug by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion is the major route of elimination of ganciclovir. In patients with normal renal function, 91.3 \u00b1 5.0% (n=4) of intravenously administered ganciclovir was recovered unmetabolized in the urine. Systemic clearance of intravenously administered ganciclovir was 3.52 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=98) while renal clearance was 3.20 \u00b1 0.80 mL/min/kg (n=47), accounting for 91 \u00b1 11% of the systemic clearance (n=47). Half-life was 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 hours (n=98) following intravenous administration Special Populations Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration of ganciclovir solution were evaluated in 10 immunocompromised patients with renal impairment who received doses ranging from 1.25 to 5.0 mg/kg. Decreased renal function results in decreased clearance of ganciclovir ( Table 7 ). Table 7. Ganciclovir Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairment Estimated Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) n Dose Clearance (mL/min) Mean \u00b1 SD Half-life (hours) Mean \u00b1 SD 50-79 4 3.2-5 mg/kg 128 \u00b1 63 4.6 \u00b1 1.4 25-49 3 3-5 mg/kg 57 \u00b1 8 4.4 \u00b1 0.4 <25 3 1.25-5 mg/kg 30 \u00b1 13 10.7 \u00b1 5.7 Plasma concentrations of ganciclovir are reduced by about 50% during a 4 hour hemodialysis session. Pharmacokinetics in Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetic profiles of ganciclovir in patients 65 years of age and older have not been established. As ganciclovir is mainly renally excreted and since renal clearance decreases with age, a decrease in ganciclovir total body clearance and a prolongation of ganciclovir half-life can be anticipated in patients 65 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Drug Interaction Studies Tables 8 and 9 provide a listing of established drug interaction studies with ganciclovir. Table 8 provides the effects of coadministered drug on ganciclovir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, whereas Table 9 provides the effects of ganciclovir on plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of coadministered drug.

      "12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in cell culture and in vivo . In CMV-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to ganciclovir monophosphate by the viral protein kinase, pUL97. Further phosphorylation occurs by cellular kinases to produce ganciclovir triphosphate, which is then slowly metabolized intracellularly. As the phosphorylation is largely dependent on the viral kinase, phosphorylation of ganciclovir occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, pUL54, by ganciclovir triphosphate. Antiviral Activity The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of human herpes viruses to antivirals and clinical response to antiviral therapy has not been established, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of virus in cell culture by 50% (EC 50 ), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors including the assay used. Thus the median concentration of ganciclovir that inhibits CMV replication (EC 50 value) in cell culture (laboratory strains or clinical isolates) has ranged from 0.08 to 13.6 \u03bcM (0.02 to 3.48 mcg/mL). Ganciclovir inhibits mammalian cell proliferation (CC 50 value) in cell culture at higher concentrations ranging from 118 to 2840 \u03bcM (30 to 725 mcg/mL). Bone marrow-derived colony-forming cells are more sensitive [CC 50 value = 0.1 to 2.7 \u03bcM (0.028 to 0.7 mcg/mL)]. The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture and clinical response has not been established. Viral Resistance Cell Culture CMV isolates with reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir have been selected in cell culture. Growth of CMV strains in the presence of ganciclovir resulted in the selection of amino acid substitutions in the viral protein kinase pUL97 and the viral DNA polymerase pUL54. In Vivo Viruses resistant to ganciclovir can arise after prolonged treatment or prophylaxis with ganciclovir by selection of substitutions in pUL97 and/or pUL54. Limited clinical data are available on the development of clinical resistance to ganciclovir and many pathways to resistance likely exist. In clinical isolates, seven canonical pUL97 substitutions, (M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, C603W) are the most frequently reported ganciclovir resistance-associated substitutions. These and other substitutions less frequently reported in the literature, or observed in clinical trials, are listed in Table 10 . Table 10.

Viral resistance has also been observed in patients receiving prolonged treatment for CMV retinitis with ganciclovir. In a controlled study of oral ganciclovir for prevention of AIDS-associated CMV disease, 364 individuals had one or more cultures performed after at least 90 days of ganciclovir treatment. Of these, 113 had at least one positive culture. The last available isolate from each subject was tested for reduced sensitivity, and 2 of 40 were found to be resistant to ganciclovir. These resistant isolates were associated with subsequent treatment failure for retinitis. The possibility of viral resistance should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response or experience persistent viral excretion during therapy. Cross Resistance Cross-resistance has been reported for amino acid substitutions selected in cell culture by ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet. In general, amino acid substitutions in pUL54 conferring cross-resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir are located within the exonuclease domains and region V of the viral DNA polymerase. Whereas, amino acid substitutions conferring cross-resistance to foscarnet are diverse, but concentrate at and between regions II (codons 696-742) and III (codons 805-845). The amino acid substitutions that resulted in reduced susceptibility to ganciclovir and either cidofovir and/or foscarnet are summarized in Table 11 . Table 11.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in mice at the same mean drug exposure in humans as at the RHD (5 mg/kg). At the dose of 1000 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the exposure at the RHD), there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males, forestomach (nonglandular mucosa) in males and females, and reproductive tissues (ovaries, uterus, mammary gland, clitoral gland and vagina) and liver in females. At the dose of 20 mg/kg/day (0.1 times the exposure at the RHD), a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males, forestomach in males and females, and liver in females. No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg/kg/day (exposure estimated as 0.01 times the RHD). Except for histiocytic sarcoma of the liver, ganciclovir-induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin. Although the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans. Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2000 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. In the mouse micronucleus assay, ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg/kg (2.8 to 10 times the exposure at the RHD) but not at doses of 50 mg/kg (exposure approximately comparable to the RHD). Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5000 \u00b5g/mL. Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following doses of 90 mg/kg/day (exposures approximately 1.7 times the RHD). Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. Systemic drug exposure (AUC) at the lowest dose showing toxicity in each species ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 times the exposure at the RHD."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of CMV Retinitis In a retrospective, non-randomized, single-center analysis of 41 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination between August 1983 and April 1988, treatment with intravenous ganciclovir resulted in a delay in mean (median) time to first retinitis progression compared to untreated controls [105 (71) days from diagnosis vs. 35 (29) days from diagnosis]. Patients in this series received induction treatment of intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 to 21 days followed by maintenance treatment with either 5 mg/kg once daily, 7 days per week or 6 mg/kg once daily, 5 days per week. In a controlled, randomized study conducted between February 1989 and December 1990, immediate treatment with intravenous ganciclovir was compared to delayed treatment in 42 patients with AIDS and peripheral CMV retinitis; 35 of 42 patients (13 in the immediate-treatment group and 22 in the delayed-treatment group) were included in the analysis of time to retinitis progression. Based on masked assessment of fundus photographs, the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of retinitis were 66 days [39, 94] and 50 days [40, 84], respectively, in the immediate-treatment group compared to 19 days [11, 27] and 13.5 days [8, 18], respectively, in the delayed-treatment group. Data from trials ICM 1653, ICM 1774, and AVI 034, which were performed comparing intravenous ganciclovir to oral ganciclovir for treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, are shown in Table 12 , and Figures 1 , 2 , and 3 , and are discussed below.

Following the 21-day intravenous induction course, patients with stable CMV retinitis were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either intravenous ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily (3000 mg/day). The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 57 days [44, 70] and 29 days [28, 43], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [50, 73] and 49 days [29, 61], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -5 days [-22, 12]. See Figure 1 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial ICM 1774 In this three-arm, randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and August 1993, patients with AIDS and stable CMV retinitis following from 4 weeks to 4 months of treatment with intravenous ganciclovir solution were randomized to receive maintenance treatment with intravenous ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg once daily, ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily, or ganciclovir capsules, 1000 mg three times daily for 20 weeks. The study showed that the mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 54 days [48, 60] and 42 days [31, 54], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 66 days [56, 76] and 54 days [41, 69], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -12 days [-24, 0]. See Figure 2 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Trial AVI 034 In this randomized, open-label, parallel group trial, conducted between June 1991 and February 1993, patients with AIDS and newly diagnosed (81%) or previously treated (19%) CMV retinitis who had tolerated 10 to 21 days of induction treatment with intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily, were randomized to receive 20 weeks of maintenance treatment with either ganciclovir capsules, 500 mg 6 times daily or intravenous ganciclovir solution, 5 mg/kg/day. The mean [95% CI] and median [95% CI] times to progression of CMV retinitis, as assessed by masked reading of fundus photographs, were 51 days [44, 57] and 41 days [31, 45], respectively, for patients on oral therapy compared to 62 days [52, 72] and 60 days [42, 83], respectively, for patients on intravenous therapy. The difference [95% CI] in the mean time to progression between the oral and intravenous therapies (oral - IV) was -11 days [-24, 1]. See Figure 3 for comparison of the proportion of patients remaining free of progression over time. Comparison of other CMV retinitis outcomes between oral and IV formulations (development of bilateral retinitis, progression into Zone 1, and deterioration of visual acuity), while not definitive, showed no marked differences between treatment groups in these studies. Because of low event rates among these endpoints, these studies are underpowered to rule out significant differences in these endpoints. Figure 1.

Trial ICM 1496 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 149 heart transplant recipients at risk for CMV infection (CMV seropositive or a seronegative recipient of an organ from a CMV seropositive donor), there was a reduction in the overall incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Immediately post-transplant, patients received intravenous ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 6 mg/kg once daily for 5 days/week for an additional 14 days. Twelve of the 76 (16%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir vs. 31 of the 73 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the 120-day post-transplant observation period. No significant differences in hematologic toxicities were seen between the two treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Trial ICM 1689 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 72 bone marrow transplant recipients with asymptomatic CMV infection (CMV positive culture of urine, throat or blood) there was a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir following successful hematopoietic engraftment. Patients with virologic evidence of CMV infection received intravenous ganciclovir solution 5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily through day 100 post-transplant. One of the 37 (3%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir vs. 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed CMV disease during the study. At 6 months post-transplant, there continued to be a reduction in the incidence of CMV disease in patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir. Six of 37 (16%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir vs. 15 of the 35 (43%) placebo-treated patients developed disease through 6 months post-transplant. The overall rate of survival was higher in the group treated with intravenous ganciclovir, both at day 100 and day 180 post-transplant. Although the differences in hematologic toxicities were not statistically significant, the incidence of neutropenia was higher in the group treated with intravenous ganciclovir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Trial ICM 1570 This was a randomized, unblinded study that evaluated 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at risk for CMV disease. Patients underwent bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35 post-transplant. Patients with histologic, immunologic or virologic evidence of CMV infection in the lung were then randomized to observation or treatment with intravenous ganciclovir solution (5 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days followed by 5 mg/kg once daily 5 days/week until day 120). Four of 20 (20%) patients treated with intravenous ganciclovir and 14 of 20 (70%) control patients developed interstitial pneumonia. The incidence of CMV disease was lower in the group treated with intravenous ganciclovir, consistent with the results observed in ICM 1689."

      "16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING How Supplied Ganciclovir for Injection, USP is supplied in 10 mL sterile single-dose vials, each containing 543 mg ganciclovir sodium equivalent to 500 mg of ganciclovir as a white to off-white powder. The concentration of ganciclovir in the reconstituted solution is 50 mg/mL. Because ganciclovir shares some of the properties of antitumor agents (i.e., carcinogenicity and mutagenicity), consideration should be given to handling and disposal according to guidelines issued for antineoplastic drugs. Ganciclovir for Injection, USP is supplied in cartons of 25 vials (NDC 70436-089-55). Storage Store at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F); excursions permitted to 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Store reconstituted solution in the vial at 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) for no longer than 12 hours. Do not refrigerate or freeze. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Hematologic Toxicity Inform patients that ganciclovir may cause hematologic toxicity including granulocytopenia (neutropenia), anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Inform patients that their blood counts and platelet counts should be closely monitored while on treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Impairment of Renal Function Inform patients that ganciclovir has been associated with decreased renal function and that serum creatinine or creatinine clearance should be monitored while on treatment to allow for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Impairment of Fertility Inform patients that ganciclovir may cause temporary or permanent infertility in humans [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Pregnancy and Contraception Advise female patients to use effective contraception during and for at least 30 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection. Similarly, advise men to practice barrier contraception during and for at least 90 days following treatment with ganciclovir for injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) ]. Carcinogenicity Inform patients that ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )]. Drug Interactions Inform patients that ganciclovir for injection may interact with other drugs. Advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other medication [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Impairment of Cognitive Ability Based on the adverse reaction profile, ganciclovir may affect cognitive abilities, including the ability to drive and operate machinery, as seizures, dizziness, and/or confusion have been reported with the use of ganciclovir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Opthalmological Examination in Patients with CMV Retinitis Inform patients that ganciclovir is not a cure for CMV retinitis, and they may continue to experience progression of retinitis during or following treatment.

Some patients may require more frequent ophthalmological follow-up [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].
