    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology mechanism of action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. antimicrobial activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). gram-positive bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae other microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary : Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin : Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS-Photosensitivity ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory : Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity : Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions : Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood : Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System: Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see WARNINGS-Intracranial Hypertension ). Headache has also been reported. Other : Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS-Tooth Development ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases, involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR < 80mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis \u2014 In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species . Acinetobacter species . Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions : Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet\u2019s syndrome).

      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS - Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole: Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal : Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary: Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin: Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS-Photosensitivity ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory: Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity: Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood: Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System: Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see WARNINGS-Intracranial Hypertension ). Headache has also been reported. Other: Thyroid cancer has been reported in the postmarketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS-Tooth Development ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases, involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet\u2019s syndrome).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum 1 When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms. Susceptibility Test Methods For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: \u2022 Escherichia coli. \u2022 Enterobacter aerogenes. \u2022 Shigella species. \u2022 Acinetobacter species. \u2022 Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . \u2022 Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: \u2022 Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . \u2022 Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: \u2022 Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. \u2022 Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . \u2022 Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . \u2022 Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . \u2022 Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . \u2022 Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. \u2022 Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . \u2022 Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . \u2022 Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride capsules. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug /Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infec\u2011tions in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours.

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What are minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are a tetracycline-class antibiotic medicine. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria. These include infections of the skin, respiratory tract, urinary tract, some sexually transmitted diseases, and others. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be used along with other treatments for severe acne. Sometimes other germs, called viruses, cause infections. The common cold is a virus. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other antibiotics, do not treat viruses. Who should not use minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Do not take minocycline hydrochloride capsules if you are allergic to minocycline or other tetracycline antibiotics. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medications if you are not sure. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in minocycline hydrochloride capsules. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are not recommended for pregnant women or children up to 8 years old because: 1. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may harm an unborn baby 2. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may permanently turn a baby's or child's teeth yellow-gray-brown during tooth development. Tooth development happens in the last half of pregnancy and birth to age 8 years. What should I tell my doctor before starting minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems. are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may harm your unborn baby . Stop taking minocycline hydrochloride capsules and call your doctor if you become pregnant while taking them. are breast feeding.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 \u00b5g/mL (average 3.5 \u00b5g/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeriamonocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline (class) or minocycline powder 1,2 . The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method 2,3 . This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 \u00b5g tetracycline (class disk) or 30 \u00b5g minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Minocycline and Tetracycline a Organisms that are susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to minocycline. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline. b The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than susceptible. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism, if the antimicrobial drug-reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test 1,2,3 . Standard tetracycline (class compound) or minocycline powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the disc diffusion technique, using the 30 mcg tetracycline or 30 mcg minocycline disk the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved.

Enterobacter aerogenes . Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue .

Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years Of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (See WARNINGS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence . Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

      "PATIENT INFORMATION Dispense with Patient Package Insert available at: www.tevausa.com/PatientPI PATIENT INFORMATION Minocycline Hydrochloride (min\u2033 oh sye\u2032 kleen hye\u2033 droe klor\u2032 ide) Capsules Read the Patient Information that comes with minocycline hydrochloride capsules before you or a family member starts taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This Patient Information leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. What are minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are a tetracycline-class antibiotic medicine. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria. These include infections of the skin, respiratory tract, urinary tract, some sexually transmitted diseases, and others. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be used along with other treatments for severe acne. Sometimes other germs, called viruses, cause infections. The common cold is a virus. Minocycline hydrochloride, like other antibiotics, does not treat viruses. Who should not take minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Do not take minocycline hydrochloride capsules if you are allergic to minocycline or other tetracycline antibiotics. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure. See the end of this Patient Information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in minocycline hydrochloride capsules. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are not recommended for pregnant women or children under 8 years of age because: 1. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may harm an unborn baby. 2.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines."

Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats."

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology mechanism of action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. antimicrobial activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). gram-positive bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae other microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole : Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal : Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary : Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin : Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS-Photosensitivity ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory : Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity : Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions : Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood : Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System: Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see WARNINGS-Intracranial Hypertension ). Headache has also been reported. Other : Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post-marketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS-Tooth Development ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases, involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome).

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR < 80mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours (average 1.71 hours) and ranged from 491.71 to 1292.70 ng/mL (average 758.29 ng/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.38 to 24.31 hours (average 17.03 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased (6%). The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased (12%) and delayed by 1.09 hours when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species . Acinetobacter species . Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species . Minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthraci s . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride tablets for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline\u2019s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole : Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal : Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary : Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin : Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS-Photosensitivity ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory : Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity : Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions : Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood : Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System : Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see WARNINGS-Intracranial Hypertension ). Headache has also been reported. Other : Thyroid cancer has been reported in the postmarketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS-Tooth Development ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases, involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions : Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet\u2019s syndrome).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The tablets should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride tablets is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg tablets may be given initially followed by one 50 mg tablet 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). ( 5.1 ) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.3 ) If renal impairment exists, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. ( 5.4 ) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. ( 5.5 ) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. ( 5.6 ) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 ) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.1) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ]. B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/ kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ]. 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus -like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UV A/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 7.5 ) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, can not be ruled out.

If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/ kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0-24) and C max were 33.32 \u00b5g \u00d7 hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 46.35 mcg \u00d7 hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for Minocin \u00ae capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both products. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, 55 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, 90 mg and 135 mg. When minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline hydrochloride was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline hydrochloride did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis-Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility-Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis \u2014 In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

Patients should seek medical advice if they experience symptoms which can include loss of appetite, tiredness, diarrhea, skin turning yellow, bleeding easily, confusion, and sleepiness. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. Patients should seek medical help for persistent headaches or blurred vision. Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Autoimmune syndromes, including drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis and serum sickness have been observed with tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Symptoms may be manifested by arthralgia, fever, rash and malaise. Patients who experience such symptoms should be cautioned to stop the drug immediately and seek medical help. Patients should be counseled about discoloration of skin, scars, teeth or gums that can arise from minocycline therapy. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours (average 1.71 hours) and ranged from 491.71 to 1292.70 ng/mL (average 758.29 ng/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.38 to 24.31 hours (average 17.03 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased (6%). The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased (12%) and delayed by 1.09 hours when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline HCl may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have similar antimicrobial spectra of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracyclines is common. Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended. Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible. Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection. Bacillus anthracis a Listeria monocytogenes a Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Calymmatobacterium granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Because many strains of the following groups of gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended. Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae a Neisseria meningitidis a Shigella species \u201cOTHER\u201d MICROORGANISMS Actinomyces species a Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydia psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species a Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme a Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum a Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue a Ureaplasma urealyticum a When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms. Susceptibility Tests Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline. However, certain organisms (e.g., some staphylococci, and Acinetobacter species) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than tetracycline. Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method 1,3 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus: MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 4 Susceptible (S) 8 Intermediate (I) \u2265 16 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae b and Streptococcus pneumoniae c : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 2 Susceptible (S) 4 Intermediate (I) \u2265 8 Resistant (R) b. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium. 1 c. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation-adjusted Muller-Hinton broth with 2 to 5% lysed horse blood. 1 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae d : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 0.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5-1 Intermediate (I) \u2265 2 Resistant (R) d. These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements. 1 A report of \u201cSusceptible\u201d indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \u201cIntermediate\u201d indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \u201cResistant\u201d indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values: Microorganism MIC (mcg/mL) Escherichia coli Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 25922 ATCC 29212 ATCC 29213 ATCC 49247 ATCC 49619 ATCC 49226 0.5-2 8-32 0.25-1 4-32 0.12-0.5 0.25-1 Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure 2,3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline (class disk) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae). Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus: Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 19 Susceptible (S) 15-18 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae e : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 29 Susceptible (S) 26-28 Intermediate (I) \u2264 25 Resistant (R) e. These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk. 2 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae f : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 38 Susceptible (S) 31-37 Intermediate (I) \u2264 30 Resistant (R) f. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1% growth supplements, and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk. 2 For testing Streptococcus pneumoniae g : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 23 Susceptible (S) 19-22 Intermediate (I) \u2264 18 Resistant (R) g. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller-Hinton agar adjusted with 5% sheep blood and a 30 mcg tetracycline-class disk. 2 For testing Vibrio cholerae h : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 19 Susceptible (S) 15-18 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) h. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30 mcg tetracycline-class disk. 2 Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains: Microorganism Zone Diameter Range (mm) Tetracycline Minocycline Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 25922 ATCC 29213 ATCC 49247 ATCC 49226 ATCC 49619 18-25 24-30 14-22 30-42 27-31 19-25 25-30 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae . Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydia psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunoflourescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate the meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride tablets and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINES-CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central nervous system side effects including light headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headaches and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolved after discontinuation of the tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS ). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects (See WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The tablets should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride tablets is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg tablets may be given initially followed by one 50 mg tablet four times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of four days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for five days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least seven days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CLCR <80mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum 1 When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms. Susceptibility Test Methods For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride capsules. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug /Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae . Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci . Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species . Acinetobacter species . Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS - Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean Tmax was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species . Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS. ) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CLCR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence . Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline\u2019s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole: Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary: Vulvovaginitis.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS - Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline HCl administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended. Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible. Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection. Bacillus anthracis 1 Listeria monocytogenes 1 Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Calymmatobacterium granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Because many strains of the following groups of gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended. Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species \u201cOTHER\u201d MICROORGANISMS Actinomyces species 1 Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydia psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species 1 Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme 1 Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum 1 Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue \u2020 Ureaplasma urealyticum 1 When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms. Susceptibility Tests Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline. However, certain organisms (e.g., some staphylococci, and Acinetobacter species) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than to tetracycline. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (Ref1, Ref3 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus: MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u22644.0 Susceptible (S) 8.0 Intermediate (I) \u226516.0 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae 2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u22642.0 Susceptible (S) 4.0 Intermediate (I) \u22658.0 Resistant (R) 2 These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium. Ref1 3 These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation-adjusted Muller-Hinton broth with 2 to 5% lysed horse blood. 1 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u22640.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5 to 1.0 Intermediate (I) \u22652.0 Resistant (R) 4 These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements. Ref1 A report of \u201cSusceptible\u201d indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \u201cIntermediate\u201d indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \u201cResistant\u201d indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values: Microorganism MIC Range (mcg/mL) Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 0.5 to 2.0 Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 8.0 to 32.0 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 0.25 to 1.0 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 4.0 to 32.0 Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 0.12 to 0.5 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 0.25 to 1.0 Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure (Ref2, Ref3) requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline (class disk) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30-mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobac-teriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u226519 Susceptible (S) 15 to 18 Intermediate (I) \u226414 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae 5 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u226529 Susceptible (S) 26 to 28 Intermediate (I) \u226425 Resistant (R) 5 These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30-mcg tetracycline disk. Ref2 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae 6 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u226538 Susceptible (S) 31-37 Intermediate (I) \u226430 Resistant (R) 6 These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1% growth supplements, and a 30-mcg tetracycline disk. Ref2 For testing Streptococcus pneumoniae 7 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u226523 Susceptible (S) 19 to 22 Intermediate (I) \u226418 Resistant (R) 7 These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller-Hinton agar adjusted with 5% sheep blood and a 30-mcg tetracycline disk. Ref2 For testing Vibrio cholerae 8 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u226519 Susceptible (S) 15 to 18 Intermediate (I) \u226414 Resistant (R) 8 These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30-mcg tetracycline disk. Ref2 Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30-mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains: Microorganism Zone Diameter Range (mm) Tetracycline Minocycline Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 18 to 25 19 to 25 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 24 to 30 25 to 30 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 14 to 22 \u2013 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 30 to 42 \u2013 Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 27 to 31 \u2013"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydia psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. (See WARNINGS .) Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. (See Drug Interactions .) Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D. (See WARNINGS .) All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. (See WARNINGS .) Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks. (See WARNINGS .) Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri. (See PRECAUTIONS .) Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines."

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY .) Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored. (See WARNINGS .)"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis \u2014 In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis \u2014 In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours (average 1.71 hours) and ranged from 491.71 to 1292.70 ng/mL (average 758.29 ng/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.38 to 24.31 hours (average 17.03 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased (6%). The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased (12%) and delayed by 1.09 hours when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have similar antimicrobial spectra of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae . Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydia psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes . Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infection caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate the meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride tablets and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE- CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS ). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The tablets should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride tablets is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg tablets may be given initially followed by one 50 mg tablet four times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of four days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for five days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least seven days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci . Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species . Acinetobacter species . Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS - Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions: Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8years may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis) : Discontinue if Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (antibiotic-associated colitis) occurs. ( 5.4 ) Hepatotoxicity: Discontinue if liver injury is suspected. ( 5.5 ) Central Nervous System Effects: May cause central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. ( 5.6 ) Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: May cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults and adolescents. Discontinue if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 ) Autoimmune Syndromes: Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Effects: If renal impairment exists, reduce minocycline dosage. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, discontinue minocycline immediately. 5.2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray -brown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of tetracycline-class drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use of minocycline is not recommended during tooth development. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline, during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines, including minocycline, form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue minocycline. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal), have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue minocycline if liver injury is suspected. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when minocycline is discontinued. 5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize. 5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue use of minocycline. 5.9 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines, including minocycline, may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, lower the total doses of minocycline, and if therapy is prolonged, monitor serum levels minocycline. 5.10 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Advise patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (e.g., tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. Instruct patients to use sunscreen products and wear protective apparel (e.g., hat) when exposure to sun cannot be avoided. 5.11 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (e.g., teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.13 Superinfection Use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Perform periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. A few postmarketing cases of limb reductions have been reported over decades of use; however, the association is unclear. The limited data from postmarketing reports are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, fetuses with bent limb bones were observed following oral administration of minocycline during organogenesis at systemic exposures 3 and 2 times, respectively, the exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . If a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the risk to the fetus and to discontinue treatment. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The use of tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth (yellow-gray-brown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Animal Data Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause delayed skeletal development in the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively (3 times the MRHD and 2 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis, respectively). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis through lactation at dosages of 5 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in offspring of animals that received minocycline included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of the offspring of animals that received minocycline. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tetracycline-class antibiotics, including minocycline, are present in breast milk following oral administration. There are no data on the effects of minocycline on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during minocycline therapy and for 4 days after the final dose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth have been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Safety and effectiveness of minocycline have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 hours to 4 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 hours to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0 to 24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg/day for both products. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline hydrochloride was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline hydrochloride was associated in both sexes with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline hydrochloride was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline hydrochloride did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). However, oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (15 to 40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence . Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."
    ],
    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date.",

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions: Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8years may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis) : Discontinue if Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (antibiotic-associated colitis) occurs. ( 5.4 ) Hepatotoxicity: Discontinue if liver injury is suspected. ( 5.5 ) Central Nervous System Effects: May cause central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. ( 5.6 ) Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: May cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults and adolescents. Discontinue if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 ) Autoimmune Syndromes: Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Effects: If renal impairment exists, reduce minocycline dosage. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, discontinue minocycline immediately. 5.2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray -brown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of tetracycline-class drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use of minocycline is not recommended during tooth development. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline, during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines, including minocycline, form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue minocycline. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal), have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue minocycline if liver injury is suspected. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when minocycline is discontinued. 5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize. 5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue use of minocycline. 5.9 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines, including minocycline, may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, lower the total doses of minocycline, and if therapy is prolonged, monitor serum levels minocycline. 5.10 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Advise patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (e.g., tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. Instruct patients to use sunscreen products and wear protective apparel (e.g., hat) when exposure to sun cannot be avoided. 5.11 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (e.g., teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.13 Superinfection Use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Perform periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. A few postmarketing cases of limb reductions have been reported over decades of use; however, the association is unclear. The limited data from postmarketing reports are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, fetuses with bent limb bones were observed following oral administration of minocycline during organogenesis at systemic exposures 3 and 2 times, respectively, the exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . If a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the risk to the fetus and to discontinue treatment. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The use of tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth (yellow-gray-brown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Animal Data Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause delayed skeletal development in the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively (3 times the MRHD and 2 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis, respectively). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis through lactation at dosages of 5 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in offspring of animals that received minocycline included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of the offspring of animals that received minocycline. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tetracycline-class antibiotics, including minocycline, are present in breast milk following oral administration. There are no data on the effects of minocycline on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during minocycline therapy and for 4 days after the final dose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth have been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Safety and effectiveness of minocycline have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 hours to 4 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 hours to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0 to 24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg/day for both products. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline hydrochloride was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline hydrochloride did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). However, oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (15 to 40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC ."

Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

(5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION \u2022 Minocycline like other tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis \u2014 In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. (7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION \u2022 Minocycline like other tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

Patients should be counseled about the possibility of hepatotoxicity. Patients should seek medical advice if they experience symptoms which can include loss of appetite, tiredness, diarrhea, skin turning yellow, bleeding easily, confusion, and sleepiness. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. Patients should seek medical help for persistent headaches or blurred vision. Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Autoimmune syndromes, including drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis and serum sickness have been observed with tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Symptoms may be manifested by arthralgia, fever, rash and malaise. Patients who experience such symptoms should be cautioned to stop the drug immediately and seek medical help. Patients should be counseled about discoloration of skin, scars, teeth or gums that can arise from minocycline therapy. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the current treatment course and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by other antibacterial drugs in the future. Patients should be advised to swallow Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole and not to chew, crush, or split the tablets.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence . Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines."

Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats."

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole: Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal : Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary: Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin: Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS-Photosensitivity ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory: Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity: Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood: Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System: Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see WARNINGS-Intracranial Hypertension ). Headache has also been reported. Other: Thyroid cancer has been reported in the postmarketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS-Tooth Development ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases, involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions: Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet\u2019s syndrome).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline HCl administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence . Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline\u2019s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole: Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary: Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity: Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin: Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory: Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity: Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood: Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System: Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS - General ). Headache has also been reported. Other: Thyroid cancer has been reported in the postmarketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions: Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis): Discontinue if Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (antibiotic-associated colitis) occurs. ( 5.4 ) Hepatotoxicity: Discontinue if liver injury is suspected. ( 5.5 ) Central Nervous System Effects: May cause central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. ( 5.6 ) Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: May cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults and adolescents. Discontinue if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 ) Autoimmune Syndromes: Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Effects: If renal impairment exists, reduce minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets dosage. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-graybrown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of tetracycline-class drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended during tooth development. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.4 )]. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic Associated Colitis) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal), have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if liver injury is suspected. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is discontinued. 5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize. 5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.9 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, lower the total doses of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and if therapy is prolonged, monitor serum levels minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.10 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Advise patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (e.g., tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Instruct patients to use sunscreen products and wear protective apparel (e.g., hat) when exposure to sun cannot be avoided. 5.11 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (e.g., teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae, and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.13 Superinfection Use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Perform periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. A few postmarketing cases of limb reductions have been reported over decades of use; however, the association is unclear. The limited data from postmarketing reports are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, fetuses with bent limb bones were observed following oral administration of minocycline during organogenesis at systemic exposures 3 and 2 times, respectively, the exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . If a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the risk to the fetus and to discontinue treatment. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The use of tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth (yellow-gray-brown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Animal Data Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause delayed skeletal development in the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively (3 times the MRHD and 2 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis, respectively). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis through lactation at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in offspring of animals that received minocycline included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of the offspring of animals that received minocycline. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tetracycline-class antibiotics, including minocycline, are present in breast milk following oral administration. There are no data on the effects of minocycline on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy and for 4 days after the final dose [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth have been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] . Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Safety and effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (15 to 40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) adversely affected spermatogenesis.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris was assessed in two 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older (Trial 1 and Trial 2). A total of 924 subjects with non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris received minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo for a total of 12 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 20 years and subjects were from the following racial groups: White (73%), Hispanic (13%), Black (11%), Asian/Pacific Islander (2%), and Other (2%).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . \ufffd Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines."

Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats."

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole: Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary: Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin: Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory: Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity: Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported.

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

(5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours (average 1.71 hours) and ranged from 491.71 to 1292.70 ng/mL (average 758.29 ng/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.38 to 24.31 hours (average 17.03 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased (6%). The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased (12%) and delayed by 1.09 hours when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride tablets for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The tablets should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride tablets is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg tablets may be given initially followed by one 50 mg tablet 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. (7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

It is recommended that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets not be used by men who are attempting to father a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. Patients should be advised that pseudomembranous colitis can occur with minocycline therapy. If patients develop watery or bloody stools, they should seek medical attention. Patients should be counseled about the possibility of hepatotoxicity. Patients should seek medical advice if they experience symptoms which can include loss of appetite, tiredness, diarrhea, skin turning yellow, bleeding easily, confusion, and sleepiness. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. Patients should seek medical help for persistent headaches or blurred vision. Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. Autoimmune syndromes, including drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, vasculitis and serum sickness have been observed with tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline. Symptoms may be manifested by arthralgia, fever, rash and malaise. Patients who experience such symptoms should be cautioned to stop the drug immediately and seek medical help. Patients should be counseled about discoloration of skin, scars, teeth or gums that can arise from minocycline therapy. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. Treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the current treatment course and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by other antibacterial drugs in the future. Patients should be advised to swallow Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets whole and not to chew, crush, or split the tablets.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 \u00b5g/mL (average 3.5 \u00b5g/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeriamonocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline (class) or minocycline powder 1,2 . The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method 2,3 . This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 \u00b5g tetracycline (class disk) or 30 \u00b5g minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Minocycline and Tetracycline a Organisms that are susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to minocycline. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline. b The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than susceptible. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism, if the antimicrobial drug-reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test 1,2,3 .

Enterobacter aerogenes . Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date.",

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years Of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (See WARNINGS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your doctor about your medical condition or treatment. What are minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are a tetracycline-class antibiotic medicine. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria. These include infections of the skin, respiratory tract, urinary tract, some sexually transmitted diseases, and others. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be used along with other treatments for severe acne. Sometimes other germs, called viruses, cause infections. The common cold is a virus. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other antibiotics, do not treat viruses. Who should not use minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Do not take minocycline hydrochloride capsules if you are allergic to minocycline or other tetracycline antibiotics. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a list of these medications if you are not sure. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in minocycline hydrochloride capsules. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are not recommended for pregnant women or children up to 8 years old because: 1. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may harm an unborn baby 2. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may permanently turn a baby's or child's teeth yellow-gray-brown during tooth development. Tooth development happens in the last half of pregnancy and birth to age 8 years. What should I tell my doctor before starting minocycline hydrochloride capsules? Tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have liver or kidney problems. are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may harm your unborn baby . Stop taking minocycline hydrochloride capsules and call your doctor if you become pregnant while taking them. are breast feeding. Minocycline passes into your milk and may harm your baby. You should decide whether to use minocycline hydrochloride capsules or breastfeed, but not both. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking including prescription and non-prescription medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other medicines may interact. Especially tell your doctor if you take: birth control pills. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may make your birth control pills less effective. a blood thinner medicine. The dose of your blood thinner may have to be lowered. a penicillin antibiotic medicine. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules and penicillins should not be used together. migraine medicines called ergot alkaloids. an acne medicine called isotretinoin (Accutane, Amnesteem, Claravis, Sotret). antacids that contain aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, or iron-containing products.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci . Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin- producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY Minocycline hydrochloride has been observed to cause a dark discoloration of the thyroid in experimental animals (rats, minipigs, dogs, and monkeys). In the rat, chronic treatment with minocycline hydrochloride has resulted in goiter accompanied by elevated radioactive iodine uptake and evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline hydrochloride has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline HCl administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline (class) or minocycline powder. 1,2 The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method. 2,3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline (class disk) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Minocycline and Tetracycline Species Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (mcg/mL) Zone Diameter (mm) Agar Dilution (mcg/mL) S I R S I R S I R Enterobacteriaceae a Minocycline Tetracycline \u22644 \u22644 8 8 \u226516 \u226516 \u226516 \u226515 13 to 15 12 to 14 \u226412 \u226411 Acinetobacter a Minocycline Tetracycline \u22644 \u22644 8 8 \u226516 \u226516 \u226516 \u226515 13 to 15 12 to 14 \u226412 \u226411 Haemophilus influenzae Tetracycline \u22642 4 \u22658 \u226529 26 to 28 \u226425 Streptococcus pneumoniae Tetracycline \u22641 2 \u22654 \u226528 25 to 27 \u226424 Staphylococcus aureus a Minocycline Tetracycline \u22644 \u22644 8 8 \u226516 \u226516 \u226519 \u226519 15 to 18 15 to 18 \u226414 \u226414 Vibrio cholerae a Minocycline Tetracycline \u22644 \u22644 8 8 \u226516 \u226516 \u226516 \u226519 13 to 15 15 to 18 \u226412 \u226414 Neisseria meningitidis b Minocycline -- -- -- \u226526 -- -- \u22642 -- -- Bacillus anthracis b Tetracycline \u22641 -- -- Francisella tularensis b Tetracycline \u22644 -- -- Yersinia pestis Tetracycline \u22644 8 \u226516 a Organisms that are susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to minocycline. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline. b The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than \u201csusceptible\u201d. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. A report of Susceptible (S) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection. A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism, if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test. 1-3 Standard tetracycline (class compound) or minocycline powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the disc diffusion technique, using the 30 mcg tetracycline or 30 mcg minocycline disk, the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence . Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species . In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date.",

Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ).

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. List of Microorganisms Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline (class) or minocycline powder 1,2 . The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method. 2,3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline (class disk) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Minocycline and Tetracycline a Organisms that are susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to minocycline. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline. b The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than \u201csusceptible\u201d. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism, if the antimicrobial drug-reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test 1,2,3 . Standard tetracycline (class compound) or minocycline powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the disc diffusion technique, using the 30 mcg tetracycline or 30 mcg minocycline disk the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved.

Enterobacter aerogenes . Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS ). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years Of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (See WARNINGS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of one 100 mg tablet of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 28 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 3 hours (average 1.71 hours) and ranged from 491.71 to 1292.70 ng/mL (average 758.29 ng/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.38 to 24.31 hours (average 17.03 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets were given concomitantly with a meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride tablets was slightly decreased (6%). The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased (12%) and delayed by 1.09 hours when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline HCl may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have similar antimicrobial spectra of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS: Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended. Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible. Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection. Bacillus anthracis a Listeria monocytogenes a Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Calymmatobacterium granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Because many strains of the following groups of gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended. Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae a Neisseria meningitidis a Shigella species \"OTHER\" MICROORGANISMS Actinomyces species a Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydia psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species a Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme a Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum a Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue a Ureaplasma urealyticum a. When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms. Susceptibility Tests Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline. However, certain organisms (e.g., some staphylococci, and Acinetobacter species) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than tetracycline. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method 1,3 (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus: MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 4 Susceptible (S) 8 Intermediate (I) \u2265 16 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae b and Streptococcus pneumoniae c : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 2 Susceptible (S) 4 Intermediate (I) \u2265 8 Resistant (R) b. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium. 1 c. These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation-adjusted Muller-Hinton broth with 2 to 5% lysed horse blood. 1 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae d : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 0.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5-1 Intermediate (I) \u2265 2 Resistant (R) d. These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements. 1 A report of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values: Microorganism MIC (mcg/mL) Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 0.5-2 Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 8-32 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 0.25-1 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 4-32 Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 0.12-0.5 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 0.25-1 Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure 2,3 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline (class disk) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 19 Susceptible (S) 15-18 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae e : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 29 Susceptible (S) 26-28 Intermediate (I) \u2264 25 Resistant (R) e. These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk. 2 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae f : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 38 Susceptible (S) 31-37 Intermediate (I) \u2264 30 Resistant (R) f. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1% growth supplements, and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk. 2 For testing Streptococcus pneumoniae g : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 23 Susceptible (S) 19-22 Intermediate (I) \u2264 18 Resistant (R) g. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller-Hinton agar adjusted with 5% sheep blood and a 30 mcg tetracycline class disk. 2 For testing Vibrio cholerae h : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 19 Susceptible (S) 15-18 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) h. These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30 mcg tetracycline class disk. 2 Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains: Microorganism Zone Diameter Range (mm) Tetracycline Minocycline Escherichia coli ATCC25922 18-25 19-25 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 24-30 25-30 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 14-22 --- Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 30-42 --- Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 27-31 ---"

Minocycline hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate the meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of, minocycline hydrochloride tablets and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fetal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/ Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS) . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS) . Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The tablets should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride tablets is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg tablets may be given initially followed by one 50 mg tablet four times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of four days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for five days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least seven days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS )."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline hydrochloride administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum . Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus . (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection.) When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue .

Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride capsules. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug /Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )."

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules USP is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infec\u2011tions in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (See WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6.2 )] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022 The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis \u2014 In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION \u2022 Minocycline like other tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience.

Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

(7.1) The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. (7.3) To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. (7.5) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. 7.3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multi-center study to evaluate the effect of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test."

( 5.1 , 8.1 ) \u2022The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride 100 mg capsules administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL).The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers is one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: AEROBIC GRAM-POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS Because many strains of the following gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended. Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible. Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection. Bacillus anthracis 1 Listeria monocytogenes 1 Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae AEROBIC GRAM-NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Calymmatobacterium granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Because many strains of the following groups of gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines, culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended. Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species \"OTHER\" MICROORGANISMS Actinomyces species 1 Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydia psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species 1 Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme 1 Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum 1 Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue 1 Ureaplasma urealyticum 1 When penicillin is contraindicated, tetracyclines are alternative drugs in the treatment of infections caused by the cited microorganisms. Susceptibility Tests Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline. However, certain organisms (eg, some staphylococci and Acinetobacter species) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than to tetracycline. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (Ref1, Ref3) (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 4 Susceptible (S) 8 Intermediate (I) \u226516 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae 2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 2 Susceptible (S) 4 Intermediate (I) \u2265 8 Resistant (R) 2 These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium.Ref1 3 These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation-adjusted Muller-Hinton broth with 2 to 5% lysed horse blood. 1 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 : MIC (mcg/mL) Interpretation \u2264 0.25 Susceptible (S) 0.5 to 1 Intermediate (I) \u2265 2 Resistant (R) 4 These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1% defined growth supplements.Ref1 A report of \"Susceptible\" indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of \"Intermediate\" indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of \"Resistant\" indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values: Microorganism MIC Range (mcg/mL ) Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 0.5 to 2 Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 8 to 32 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 0.25 to 1 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 4 to 32 Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 0.12 to 0.5 Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 0.25 to 1 Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedure (Ref2, Ref3) requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline (class disk) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: For testing aerobic gram-negative microorganisms (Enterobacteriaceae), Acinetobacter species and Staphylococcus aureus: Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 19 Susceptible (S) 15 to 18 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) For testing Haemophilus influenzae 5 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 29 Susceptible (S) 26 to 28 Intermediate (I) \u2264 25 Resistant (R) 5 These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with Haemophilus influenzae using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk.Ref2 For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae 6 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 38 Susceptible (S) 31 to 37 Intermediate (I) \u2264 30 Resistant (R) 6 These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1% growth supplements, and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk.Ref2 For testing Streptococcus pneumoniae 7 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 23 Susceptible (S) 19 to 22 Intermediate (I) \u2264 18 Resistant (R) 7 These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller-Hinton agar adjusted with 5% sheep blood and a 30 mcg tetracycline disk.Ref2 For testing Vibrio cholerae 8 : Zone Diameter (mm) Interpretation \u2265 19 Susceptible (S) 15 to 18 Intermediate (I) \u2264 14 Resistant (R) 8 These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30 mcg tetracycline disk. (Ref2) Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains: Microorganism Zone Diameter Range (mm) Tetracycline Minocycline Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 18 to 25 19 to 25 Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 24 to 30 25 to 30 Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 14 to 22 - Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 30 to 42 - Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619 27 to 31 -"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydia psittaci. Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis. Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Plague due to Yersinia pestis. Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis. Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus. Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis. Granuloma inguinale caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Enterobacter aerogenes. Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes. Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis. Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme. Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS ANTIBIOTICS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C.difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline, the possibility for permanent sequelae exists. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS ). All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (See WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats."

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years Of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR < 80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored potassium hydroxide (See WARNINGS )."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions : Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Clostridioides difficile-Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic-Associated Colitis): Discontinue if Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (antibiotic-associated colitis) occurs. ( 5.4 ) Hepatotoxicity : Discontinue if liver injury is suspected. ( 5.5 ) Central Nervous System Effects: May cause central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. ( 5.6 ) Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: May cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension in adults and adolescents. Discontinue if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 ) Autoimmune Syndromes : Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.8 ) Metabolic Effects : If renal impairment exists, reduce minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets dosage. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2) ] . If severe skin/hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray\u00adbrown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of tetracycline-class drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended during tooth development. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic Associated Colitis) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.5 Hepatotoxicity Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal), have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. Discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if liver injury is suspected. 5.6 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Caution patients who experience these symptoms about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are discontinued. 5.7 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been associated with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Clinical manifestations of idiopathic intracranial hypertension include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension are at a greater risk for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Avoid concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Permanent visual loss may exist, even after the medication is discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Because intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, monitor patients until they stabilize. 5.8 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Evaluate symptomatic patients. If symptoms occur, immediately discontinue use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.9 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, lower the total doses of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and if therapy is prolonged, monitor serum levels minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.10 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines, including minocycline. Advise patients to minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (e.g., tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Instruct patients to use sunscreen products and wear protective apparel (e.g., hat) when exposure to sun cannot be avoided. 5.11 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (e.g., teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae, and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.13 Superinfection Use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute appropriate therapy. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Perform periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. A few postmarketing cases of limb reductions have been reported over decades of use; however, the association is unclear. The limited data from postmarketing reports are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for birth defects or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits, fetuses with bent limb bones were observed following oral administration of minocycline during organogenesis at systemic exposures 3 and 2 times, respectively, the exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (see Data) . If a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, advise the patient of the risk to the fetus and to discontinue treatment. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The use of tetracycline class drugs, including minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth (yellow-gray-brown). Permanent discoloration of the teeth is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Animal Data Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause delayed skeletal development in the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively (3 times the MRHD and 2 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis, respectively). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis through lactation at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in offspring of animals that received minocycline included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of the offspring of animals that received minocycline. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Tetracycline-class antibiotics, including minocycline, are present in breast milk following oral administration. There are no data on the effects of minocycline on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets therapy and for 4 days after the final dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth have been observed in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precaution (5.2 , 5.3) ] . Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Safety and effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for the treatment of acne are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not bioequivalent to non-modified release minocycline products. Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC (0\u201324) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg/day for both products. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55 mg, 80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum.

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline hydrochloride was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline hydrochloride did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (15 to 40 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 \u00b5g/mL (average 3.5 \u00b5g/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1 Neisseria meningitidis 1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline (class) or minocycline powder 1,2 . The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method. 2,3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 \u00b5g tetracycline (class disk) or 30 \u00b5g minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Minocycline and Tetracycline a Organisms that are susceptible to tetracycline are also considered susceptible to minocycline. However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline. b The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than \u201csusceptible\u201d. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing.

A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism, if the antimicrobial drug-reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test 1,2,3 . Standard tetracycline (class compound) or minocycline powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the disc diffusion technique, using the 30 mcg tetracycline or 30 mcg minocycline disk the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved.

Enterobacter aerogenes . Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Note: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See PRECAUTIONS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (See WARNINGS ). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years Of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (See WARNINGS )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 \u00b5g/mL (average 3.5 \u00b5g/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean Tmax was delayed by one hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section: Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeriamonocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae1 Neisseria meningitidis1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline (class) or minocycline powder1,2. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1. Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized method2,3. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 \u00b5g tetracycline (class disk) or 30 \u00b5g minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline. The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1.

However, some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline. b The current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than susceptible. If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible, they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing. A report of Susceptible (S) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection. A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism, if the antimicrobial drug-reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test 1,2,3. Standard tetracycline (class compound) or minocycline powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2. For the disc diffusion technique, using the 30 mcg tetracycline or 30 mcg minocycline disk the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved.

Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "Warnings and Precautions Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize. PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information For Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (See WARNINGS). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (See Drug Interactions). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See PRECAUTIONS). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects: (See WARNINGS). Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (See WARNINGS). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See WARNINGS). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "overdosage": [
      "The adverse events more commonly seen in overdose are dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. No specific antidote for minocycline is known. In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients Above 8 Years Of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the anti-anabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (See WARNINGS)."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). (5.1) If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.2) If liver injury is suspected, discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets. (5.3) If renal impairment exists, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. (5.4) Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light- headedness, dizziness, or vertigo. Advise patients. (5.5) Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms occur. (5.6) Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes; discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.7) Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions, erythema multiforme, and DRESS syndrome. Discontinue Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets immediately if symptoms occur. (5.9) 5.1 Teratogenic Effects A. MINOCYCLINE, LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE-CLASS DRUGS, CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN. IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) & Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . B. THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY, AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 5.2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5.9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5.12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations, use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated."

( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri- and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets produce a delayed T max at 3.5 to 4.0 hours as compared to a non-modified release reference minocycline product (T max at 2.25 to 3 hours). At steady-state (Day 6), the mean AUC(0-24) and C max were 33.32 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.63 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride extended release tablets and 46.35 mcg\u00d7hr/mL and 2.92 mcg/mL for minocycline hydrochloride capsules, respectively. These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg per day for both product. A single-dose, four-way crossover study demonstrated that Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets used in the study (45 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg) exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In another single-dose, five-way crossover pharmacokinetic study, Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 55mg,80 mg, and 105 mg were shown to be dose-proportional to Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets 90 mg and 135 mg. When Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products, the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions. Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum."

In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. Mutagenesis \u2014Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility \u2014Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats (resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two minocycline hydrochloride capsules, 100 mg administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers, maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours (average 2.1 hours) and ranged from 2.1 to 5.1 mcg/mL (average 3.5 mcg/mL). The serum half-life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11.1 to 22.1 hours (average 15.5 hours). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high-fat meal, which included dairy products, the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions. The mean T max was delayed by 1 hour when administered with food, compared to dosing under fasting conditions. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food. In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms, the minocycline serum half-life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction, and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction. The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one-half to one-third that of other tetracyclines. Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The tetracyclines, including minocycline, have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Cross-resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common. Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). Gram-positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram-negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Campylobacter fetus Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella aerogenes Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Neisseria meningitidis Shigella species Yersinia pestis Vibrio cholerae Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by the FDA for this drug, please see https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae . Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (Ornithosis) due to Chlamydophila psittaci . Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum or Chlamydia trachomatis . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Minocycline is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli. Klebsiella aerogenes Shigella species . Acinetobacter species . Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus. (NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection). When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections. Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis . Vincent\u2019s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high. Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection . Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum . To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline hydrochloride, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. The safety of minocycline hydrochloride capsules for use during pregnancy has not been established. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue minocycline hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN). While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including minocycline hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline-associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline hydrochloride should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibiotic should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated. Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline. Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy (see WARNINGS ). Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ). Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months. Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (see WARNINGS ). Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibiotics (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibiotics, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects : (see WARNINGS .)"

    "geriatric_use": [
      "Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Minocycline hydrochloride capsules (50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) do not contain sodium."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline\u2019s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Body as a whole : Fever and discoloration of secretions. Gastrointestinal : Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, glossitis, dysphagia, enamel hypoplasia, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the oral and anogenital regions. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline-class antibiotics in capsule and tablet form. Most of these patients took the medication immediately before going to bed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Genitourinary : Vulvovaginitis. Hepatic toxicity : Hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic cholestasis, increases in liver enzymes, fatal hepatic failure, and jaundice. Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS ). Skin: Alopecia, erythema nodosum, hyperpigmentation of nails, pruritus, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, maculopapular rash and erythematous rash. Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported. Fixed drug eruptions have been reported. Lesions occurring on the glans penis have caused balanitis. Erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. Photosensitivity is discussed above (see WARNINGS-Photosensitivity ). Pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes has been reported. Respiratory : Cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, exacerbation of asthma, and pneumonitis. Renal toxicity : Interstitial nephritis. Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related (see WARNINGS ). Reversible acute renal failure has been reported. Musculoskeletal : Arthralgia, arthritis, bone discoloration, myalgia, joint stiffness, and joint swelling. Hypersensitivity reactions : Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction (including shock and fatalities), anaphylactoid purpura, myocarditis, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lupus-like syndrome and serum sickness-like reactions also have been reported. Blood : Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Central Nervous System : Convulsions, dizziness, hypesthesia, paresthesia, sedation, and vertigo. Bulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults have been reported (see WARNINGS-Intracranial Hypertension ). Headache has also been reported. Other : Thyroid cancer has been reported in the postmarketing setting in association with minocycline products. When minocycline therapy is given over prolonged periods, monitoring for signs of thyroid cancer should be considered. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. Cases of abnormal thyroid function have been reported. Tooth discoloration in children less than 8 years of age (see WARNINGS-ToothDevelopment ) and also in adults has been reported. Oral cavity discoloration (including tongue, lip, and gum) has been reported. Tinnitus and decreased hearing have been reported in patients on minocycline hydrochloride. The following syndromes have been reported. In some cases, involving these syndromes, death has been reported. As with other serious adverse reactions, if any of these syndromes are recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately: Hypersensitivity syndrome consisting of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. Lupus-like syndrome consisting of positive antinuclear antibody; arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling; and one or more of the following: fever, myalgia, hepatitis, rash, and vasculitis. Serum sickness-like syndrome consisting of fever; urticaria or rash; and arthralgia, arthritis, joint stiffness, or joint swelling and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia may be present. Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of minocycline products when taken orally. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and hypersensitivity reactions : Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet\u2019s syndrome).

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS. Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICALPHARMACOLOGY ). Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The capsules should be swallowed whole. For Pediatric Patients above 8 Years of Age Usual pediatric dose: 4 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours, not to exceed the usual adult dose. Adults The usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride capsules is 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg every 12 hours. Alternatively, if more frequent doses are preferred, two or four 50 mg capsules may be given initially followed by one 50 mg capsule 4 times daily. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections other than urethritis and anorectal infections in men: 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours for a minimum of 4 days, with post-therapy cultures within 2 to 3 days. In the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis in men, 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days is recommended. For the treatment of syphilis, the usual dosage of minocycline hydrochloride should be administered over a period of 10 to 15 days. Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended. In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days. Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases. Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum : 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days. Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CL CR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS - Antianabolic Action )."
