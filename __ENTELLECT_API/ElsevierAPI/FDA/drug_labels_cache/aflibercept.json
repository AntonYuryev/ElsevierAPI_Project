      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Important Injection Instructions For ophthalmic intravitreal injection. AHZANTIVE must only be administered by a qualified physician. Pre-filled Syringe: A 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle is needed but not provided. Vial: A 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch), a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe and a 30\u2011gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle are needed, but not provided. AHZANTIVE is available packaged as follows: Pre-filled Syringe. The AHZANTIVE pre-filled syringe cap and plunger are not made with natural rubber latex. Vial Only. The AHZANTIVE vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex. [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although AHZANTIVE may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months). Although not as effective as the recommended every 8 week dosing regimen, patients may also be treated with one dose every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy. Patients should be assessed regularly. 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly) [see Clinical Studies (14.2), (14.3)]. 2.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although AHZANTIVE may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4)] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although AHZANTIVE may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.6 Preparation for Administration - Pre-filled Syringe The AHZANTIVE pre-filled syringe is sterile and for one-time use in one eye only. The pre-filled syringe should be inspected visually prior to administration. Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, or if the package is open or damaged. Do not use if any part of the pre-filled syringe is damaged or if the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock. The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30-gauge x \u00bd-inch injection needle (not provided). The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept-mrbb (equivalent to 50 microliters). The excess volume must be discarded prior to the administration. PRE-FILLED SYRINGE DESCRIPTION - Figure 1: Use aseptic technique to carry out the following steps: 1. PREPARE When ready to administer AHZANTIVE, open the carton and remove sterilized blister pack. Carefully peel open the sterilized blister pack ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready for assembly. 2. REMOVE SYRINGE Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilized blister pack. 3. TWIST OFF SYRINGE CAP Twist off (do not snap off) the syringe cap by holding the syringe in one hand and the syringe cap with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand (see Figure 2). Figure 2: 4. ATTACH NEEDLE Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30-gauge x \u00bd-inch injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 3). Figure 3: Note: When ready to administer AHZANTIVE, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 5. DISLODGE AIR BUBBLES Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4). Figure 4: 6. EXPEL AIR AND SET THE DOSE To eliminate all bubbles and to expel excess drug, slowly depress the plunger rod to align the plunger dome edge (see Figure 5a) with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 50 microliters) (see Figure 5b). Figure 5a: Figure 5b: 7. The pre-filled syringe is for one-time use in one eye only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. 2.7 Preparation for Administration - Vial AHZANTIVE should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the vial must not be used. The glass vial is for one-time use in one eye only. Discard unused portion. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use (not provided): a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch) a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch) 1. Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see Figure 6). Figure 6: 2. Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see Figure 7). Figure 7: 3. Remove the 18-gauge x 1\u00bd-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 8). Figure 8: 4. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. 5. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the AHZANTIVE vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see Figure 9a and Figure 9b). Figure 9a: Figure 9b: 6. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. 7. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle. Note: Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. 8. Remove the 30-gauge x \u00bd-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 10). Figure 10: 9. When ready to administer AHZANTIVE, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 10. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 11). Figure 11: 11. To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod so that the plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (see Figure 12a and Figure 12b). Figure 12a: Figure 12b: 2.8 Injection Procedure The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Pre-filled syringe: Inject by pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. A small residual volume may remain in the syringe after a full dose has been injected. This is normal. Do not administer any residual solution observed in the syringe. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Each sterile vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before AHZANTIVE is administered to the other eye. After injection, any unused product must be discarded. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 3 months, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). (2 . 2) Although AHZANTIVE may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months). (2 . 2) Although not as effective as the recommended every 8 week dosing regimen, patients may also be treated with one dose every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy. Patients should be assessed regularly. (2.2) Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly). (2.3) Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for AHZANTIVE is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). (2.4, 2.5) Although AHZANTIVE may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months).

      "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Intravitreal injections, including those with aflibercept products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering AHZANTIVE. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with aflibercept products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. 5.3 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including aflibercept products. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the aflibercept group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with aflibercept in the first six months of the RVO studies. Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately. (5.1) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. (5.2) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. (5.3)"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.3)] Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2980 adult patients treated with aflibercept constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies. Among those, 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The data described below reflect exposure to aflibercept in 1824 patients with wet AMD, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, controlled clinical studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2) for 24 months (with active control in year 1) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Safety data observed in the aflibercept group in a 52-week, double-masked, Phase 2 study were consistent with these results.

Safety data observed in 269 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) through week 52 in the PANORAMA trial were consistent with those seen in the phase 3 VIVID and VISTA trials (see Table 3 above). 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of aflibercept. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: retinal vasculitis and occlusive retinal vasculitis related to intravitreal injection with aflibercept (reported at a rate of 0.6 and 0.2 per 1 million injections, respectively, based on postmarketing experience from November 2011 until November 2023). The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies with aflibercept have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposures (based on AUC for free aflibercept) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data]. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether aflibercept can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], treatment with aflibercept may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. AHZANTIVE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses \u22653 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses \u22650.1 mg per kg. Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure (AUC) observed in adult patients after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept products in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, AHZANTIVE is not recommended during breastfeeding. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AHZANTIVE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AHZANTIVE. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose, during treatment, and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of AHZANTIVE. Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of aflibercept on human fertility. Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic level observed in adult patients with an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use A pediatric assessment for AHZANTIVE demonstrates that AHZANTIVE is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which EYLEA (aflibercept) is approved. However, AHZANTIVE is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for EYLEA (aflibercept). 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2049/2701) of patients randomized to treatment with aflibercept were \u226565 years of age and approximately 46% (1250/2701) were \u226575 years of age. No significant differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept products act as soluble decoy receptors that bind VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in COPERNICUS, GALILEO, and VIBRANT at week 24 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2), (14.3)]. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence aflibercept treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Aflibercept is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of aflibercept, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of aflibercept to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean Cmax of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients. Other No dosage modification is required based on gender or in the elderly. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of aflibercept or of other aflibercept products. In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to aflibercept was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with aflibercept for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to aflibercept were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity."

      "12 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of afliberceptproducts . Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at intravitreal doses of 2 or 4 mg per eye. At the NOAEL of 0.5 mg per eye in monkeys, the systemic exposure (AUC) was 56 times higher than the exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. Similar effects were not seen in other clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active-controlled studies in patients with wet AMD. A total of 2412 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (1817 with aflibercept) in the two studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2). In each study, up to week 52, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); 3) aflibercept 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks (aflibercept 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b13 days. Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years with a mean of 76 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group in year 1.

Figure 13: Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Week 96* in VIEW1 and VIEW2 Studies *Patient dosing schedules were individualized from weeks 52 to 96 using a modified 12-week dosing regimen. VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies were both 96 weeks in duration. However after 52 weeks patients no longer followed a fixed dosing schedule. Between week 52 and week 96, patients continued to receive the drug and dosage strength to which they were initially randomized on a modified 12 week dosing schedule (doses at least every 12 weeks and additional doses as needed). Therefore, during the second year of these studies there was no active control comparison arm. 14.2 Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled studies in patients with macular edema following CRVO. A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with aflibercept) in the two studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO). In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA compared to baseline.

A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with aflibercept) in the VIBRANT study. In the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4) or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline and subsequently as needed (control group). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years. In the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. At week 24, the aflibercept 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint. Detailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 15 below.

A total of 862 randomized and treated patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years. Of those, 576 were randomized to aflibercept groups in the two studies (VIVID and VISTA). In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); and 3) macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre\u2011specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment: patients in the aflibercept groups could receive laser and patients in the laser group could receive aflibercept. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 52 as measured by ETDRS letter score. Efficacy of both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups was statistically superior to the control group. This statistically superior improvement in BCVA was maintained at week 100 in both studies. Results from the analysis of the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 7 and Figure 16 below.

Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity, prior anti-VEGF therapy) in each study were in general consistent with the results in the overall populations. 14.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of aflibercept in diabetic retinopathy (DR) are derived from the VIVID, VISTA, and PANORAMA studies. VIVID AND VISTA In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both aflibercept treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group. Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 8 below. Table 8: Proportion of Patients Who Achieved a \u22652-Step Improvement from Baseline in the ETDRS-DRSS Score at Week 100 in VIVID and VISTA Studies VIVID VISTA Aflibercept 2 mg Q8 weeks a Aflibercept 2 mg Q4 weeks Control Aflibercept 2 mg Q8 weeks a Aflibercept 2 mg Q4 weeks Control Evaluable Patients b N=101 N=97 N=99 N=148 N=153 N=150 Number of patients with a \u22652-step improvement on ETDRS-DRSS from Baseline (%) 32 (32%) 27 (28%) 7 (7%) 56 (38%) 58 (38%) 24 (16%) Difference c,d (%) (97.5% CI) 24% e (12, 36) 21% e (9, 33) 22% e (11, 33) 22% e (11, 33) Non-gradable post-baseline ETDRS-DRSS values were treated as missing and were imputed using the last gradable ETDRS-DRSS values (including baseline values if all post-baseline values were missing or non-gradable) a After treatment initiation with 5 monthly injections b The number of evaluable patients included all patients who had valid ETDRS-DRSS data at baseline c Difference with confidence interval (CI) was calculated using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted by protocol specified stratification factors d Difference is Aflibercept minus Control group e p<0.01 compared with Control Results of the evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity) on the proportion of patients who achieved a \u22652-step improvement on the ETDRS-DRSS from baseline to week 100 were, in general, consistent with those in the overall population. PANORAMA The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and efficacy of aflibercept in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS of 47 or 53), without central-involved DME (CI-DME). A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days for the first 5 visits, then every 8 weeks (56\u00b17 days). Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55.7 years. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) 3 initial monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks (aflibercept 2Q16); 2) 5 monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks (aflibercept 2Q8); and 3) sham treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by \u22652 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined aflibercept groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52. At week 52, efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group (see Table 9 and Table 10). The proportion of patients with a \u22652-step improvement over time is shown in Figure 17.

EYDENZELT must only be administered by a qualified physician. Pre-filled Syringe: A 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle is needed but not provided. Vial: A 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch), a 1-mL Luer lock syringe and a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle are needed. EYDENZELT is available packaged as follows: Pre-filled Syringe Vial Kit with Injection Components (filter needle, syringe, injection needle) [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. 2.2 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The recommended dose for EYDENZELT is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYDENZELT may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months). Although not as effective as the recommended every 8 week dosing regimen, patients may also be treated with one dose every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy. Patients should be assessed regularly. 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for EYDENZELT is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. 2.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The recommended dose for EYDENZELT is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYDENZELT may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for EYDENZELT is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYDENZELT may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.6 Preparation for Administration - Pre-filled Syringe The EYDENZELT pre-filled syringe is sterile and for one-time use in one eye only. It should be inspected visually prior to administration. Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, or if the package is open or damaged. Do not use if any part of the pre-filled syringe is damaged or if the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock. The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle (not included). The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept-boav (equivalent to 0.05 mL). Discard the excess volume prior to administration. PRE-FILLED SYRINGE DESCRIPTION \u2013 Figure 1: Use aseptic technique to carry out the following steps. 1. Open the Carton. When ready to administer EYDENZELT, open the carton and remove sterilized blister pack. Carefully peel open the sterilized blister pack ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the pre-filled syringe in the sterilized blister pack until you are ready for assembly. 2. Remove the Pre-filled Syringe. Using aseptic technique, remove the pre-filled syringe from the sterilized blister pack. 3. Twist Off the Syringe Cap. Twist off (do not snap off) the syringe cap by holding the pre-filled syringe in one hand and the syringe cap with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand (see Figure 2 ). Note: To avoid compromising the sterility of the product, do not pull back on the plunger. Figure 2: 4. Attach the Needle to the Pre-filled Syringe. Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3: Note: When ready to administer EYDENZELT, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 5. Check for Air Bubbles. Hold the pre-filled syringe with the needle pointing up and check the pre-filled syringe for bubbles (see Figure 4a ). If there are bubbles, gently tap the pre-filled syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4b ). Figure 4a: Figure 4b: 6. Remove Air bubbles and Set the Dose. To remove all bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod to align the plunger dome edge (see Figure 5a ) with the dosing marker shown on the barrel of the pre-filled syringe (equivalent to 0.05 mL) (see Figure 5b ). Figure 5a: Figure 5b: 7. The pre-filled syringe is for one-time use is one eye only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4a Figure 4b Figure 5a Figure 5b 2.7 Preparation for Administration - Vial EYDENZELDT should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the vial must not be used. The glass vial is for one-time use in one eye only. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use (included): a 5 micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1 \u00bd inch) a 1 mL sterile Luer lock Syringe (with marking to measure 0.05 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd inch) 1. Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see Figure 6 ). Figure 6: 2. Disinfect the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see Figure 7 ). Figure 7: 3. Remove the 18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 8 ). Figure 8: 4. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. 5. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the EYDENZELDT vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see Figure 9 ). Figure 9: 6. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. 7. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle. Note: Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. 8. Remove the 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 10 ). Figure 10: 9. When ready to administer EYDENZELT, remove the plastic needle cap from the needle (see Figure 11 ). Figure 11: 10. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 12 ). Figure 12: 11. To remove all of the air bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger so that the plunger tip aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (see Figure 13 ). Figure 13: Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12 Figure 13 2.8 Injection Procedure The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Pre-filled syringe : Inject by pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. A small residual volume may remain in the syringe after a full dose has been injected. This is normal. Do not administer any residual solution observed in the syringe. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each sterile, pre-filled syringe or vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile, pre-filled syringe or vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before EYDENZELT is administered to the other eye. After injection, any unused product must be discarded."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. ( 5.2 ) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Intravitreal injections, including those with aflibercept products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYDENZELT. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with aflibercept products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including aflibercept products. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the aflibercept group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with aflibercept in the first six months of the RVO studies."

A total of 2980 adult patients treated with aflibercept constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies. Among those, 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The data described below reflect exposure to aflibercept in 1824 patients with wet AMD, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, controlled clinical studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2) for 24 months (with active control in year 1) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Safety data observed in the aflibercept group in a 52-week, double-masked, Phase 2 study were consistent with these results.

Safety data observed in 269 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) through week 52 in the PANORAMA trial were consistent with those seen in the phase 3 VIVID and VISTA trials (see Table 3 above). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of aflibercept. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders : retinal vasculitis and occlusive retinal vasculitis related to intravitreal injection with aflibercept (reported at a rate of 0.6 and 0.2 per 1 million injections, respectively, based on postmarketing experience from November 2011 until November 2023)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies with aflibercept have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposures (based on AUC for free aflibercept) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data ]. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether aflibercept can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], treatment with aflibercept may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. EYDENZELT should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses \u22653 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses \u22650.1 mg per kg. Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure (AUC) observed in adult patients after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept products in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, EYDENZELT is not recommended during breastfeeding. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for EYDENZELT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EYDENZELT. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose, during treatment, and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of EYDENZELT. Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of aflibercept on human fertility. Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic level observed in adult patients with an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use A pediatric assessment for EYDENZELT demonstrates that EYDENZELT is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which EYLEA (aflibercept) is approved. However, EYDENZELT is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for EYLEA (aflibercept). 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2049/2701) of patients randomized to treatment with aflibercept were \u226565 years of age and approximately 46% (1250/2701) were \u226575 years of age. No significant differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Aflibercept-boav is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Aflibercept-boav is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kilodaltons (kDa) and contains glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular weight of 115 kDa. Aflibercept-boav is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. EYDENZELT (aflibercept-boav) injection is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, and colorless to very pale brownish-yellow solution. EYDENZELT does not contain anti-microbial preservative and is supplied as a sterile, aqueous solution for intravitreal injection in a single-dose, pre-filled syringe or a single-dose glass vial designed to deliver 0.05 mL of solution containing 2 mg of aflibercept-boav in histidine (0.038 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate (0.033 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.015 mg), sodium chloride (0.038 mg), trehalose (5 mg) and water for injection with a pH of 6.2."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept products act as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in COPERNICUS, GALILEO, and VIBRANT at week 24 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence aflibercept treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Aflibercept is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of aflibercept, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of aflibercept to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean C max of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients . Other No dosage modification is required based on gender or in the elderly. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of aflibercept or of other aflibercept products. In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to aflibercept was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with aflibercept for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to aflibercept were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity."

Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at intravitreal doses of 2 or 4 mg per eye. At the NOAEL of 0.5 mg per eye in monkeys, the systemic exposure (AUC) was 56 times higher than the exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg.

A total of 2412 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (1817 with aflibercept) in the two studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2). In each study, up to week 52, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); 3) aflibercept 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks (aflibercept 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b13 days. Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years with a mean of 76 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group in year 1. Detailed results from the analysis of the VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies are shown in Table 4 and Figure 14 below.

Figure 14: Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Week 96 Patient dosing schedules were individualized from weeks 52 to 96 using a modified 12-week dosing regimen. in VIEW1 and VIEW2 Studies VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies were both 96 weeks in duration. However, after 52 weeks patients no longer followed a fixed dosing schedule. Between week 52 and week 96, patients continued to receive the drug and dosage strength to which they were initially randomized on a modified 12 week dosing schedule (doses at least every 12 weeks and additional doses as needed). Therefore, during the second year of these studies there was no active control comparison arm. Figure 14 14.2 Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled studies in patients with macular edema following CRVO. A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with aflibercept) in the two studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO). In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA compared to baseline.

Figure 16 14.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled studies in patients with DME. A total of 862 randomized and treated patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years. Of those, 576 were randomized to aflibercept groups in the two studies (VIVID and VISTA). In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); and 3) macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment: patients in the aflibercept groups could receive laser and patients in the laser group could receive aflibercept. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 52 as measured by ETDRS letter score. Efficacy of both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups was statistically superior to the control group. This statistically superior improvement in BCVA was maintained at week 100 in both studies. Results from the analysis of the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 7 and Figure 17 below.

Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity, prior anti-VEGF therapy) in each study were in general consistent with the results in the overall populations. Figure 17 14.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of aflibercept in diabetic retinopathy (DR) are derived from the VIVID, VISTA, and PANORAMA studies. VIVID AND VISTA In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both aflibercept treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group. Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 8 below.

PANORAMA The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and efficacy of aflibercept in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS of 47 or 53), without central-involved DME (CI-DME). A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days for the first 5 visits, then every 8 weeks (56\u00b17 days). Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55.7 years. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) 3 initial monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks (aflibercept 2Q16); 2) 5 monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks (aflibercept 2Q8); and 3) sham treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by \u22652 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined aflibercept groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52. At week 52, efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group (see Table 9 and Table 10 ). The proportion of patients with a \u22652-step improvement over time is shown in Figure 18.

Some patients did not maintain a response with extended dosing intervals after successful response to the three initial monthly doses [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . These patients may benefit from resuming every 4-week dosing (approximately every 28 days +/- 7 days). 2.5 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for EYLEA HD is 8 mg (0.07 mL of 114.3 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days +/- 7 days) for the first three to five doses, followed by 8 mg (0.07 mL of 114.3 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks, +/- 1 week. Some patients did not maintain a response with extended dosing intervals after successful response to the first three to five initial monthly doses [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . These patients may benefit from resuming every 4-week dosing (approximately every 28 days +/- 7 days). 2.6 Preparation for Administration The EYLEA HD glass vial is for one-time use in one eye only. Discard unused portion. EYLEA HD does not contain an anti-microbial preservative. Extraction of multiple doses from a single vial may increase the risk of contamination and subsequent infection. Do not use if the package or its components are expired, damaged, or have been tampered with. Check the label on the vial to make sure you have the correct aflibercept strength. Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use. a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch) a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe (with marking to measure 0.07 mL) a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch) 1. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use the vial if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible. 2. Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1: 3. Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2: 4. Use aseptic technique to carry out steps 4 \u2013 11. Remove the 18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3: 5. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. 6. Withdraw all of the EYLEA HD vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see Figure 4a and Figure 4b ). Figure 4a: Figure 4b: 7. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. 8. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle. Note : Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. 9. Remove the 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 5 ). Figure 5: 10. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 6 ). Figure 6: 11. To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger so that the plunger tip aligns with the line that marks 0.07 mL on the syringe (see Figure 7a and Figure 7b ). Figure 7a: Figure 7b: Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4a Figure 4b Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7a Figure 7b 2.7 Injection Procedure The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new vial should be used and the sterile field (including a new syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter and injection needles) should be changed before EYLEA HD is administered to the other eye. After injection, discard any unused product or waste material in accordance with local regulations."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. ( 5.2 ) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Intravitreal injections including those with aflibercept have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA HD. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA HD [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. 5.3 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA HD. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in the wet AMD study (PULSAR) from baseline through week 48 was 0.4% (3 out of 673) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA HD compared with 1.5% (5 out of 336) in patients treated with EYLEA 2 mg. The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in the DME study (PHOTON) from baseline to week 48 was 3.1% (15 out of 491) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA HD compared with 3.6% (6 out of 167) in patients treated with EYLEA 2 mg. The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in the RVO study (QUASAR) from baseline to week 36 was 0.5% (3 out of 591) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA HD compared with 1.7% (5 out of 301) in patients treated with EYLEA 2 mg."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies with EYLEA HD have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposure (based on AUC for free aflibercept) was approximately 0.9 -fold of the population pharmacokinetic estimated exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg (see Data ) . Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether EYLEA HD can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , treatment with EYLEA HD may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. EYLEA HD should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses \u22653 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses \u22650.1 mg per kg. Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 0.9-fold of the population pharmacokinetic estimated systemic exposure (AUC) in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, EYLEA HD is not recommended during breastfeeding. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for EYLEA HD and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EYLEA HD. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose, during treatment, and for at least 4 months after the last intravitreal injection of EYLEA HD. Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of EYLEA HD on human fertility. Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose 91 times higher (based on AUC of free aflibercept) than the corresponding systemic level estimated based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in humans following an intravitreal dose of 8 mg. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EYLEA HD in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 66% (1156/1755) of the patients in the HD groups were 65 years of age or older and approximately 31% (543/1755) of the patients were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of EYLEA HD have been observed."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein and contains glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular weight of 115 kDa. Aflibercept is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. EYLEA HD (aflibercept) injection is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, and colorless to pale yellow solution. EYLEA HD is supplied as a sterile, aqueous solution for intravitreal injection in a single-dose glass vial designed to deliver 0.07 mL (70 microliters) of solution containing 8 mg of aflibercept in a buffer containing arginine hydrochloride (0.737 mg), histidine (0.04 mg), L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (0.093 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.021 mg), sucrose (3.5 mg) and water for injection with a pH of 5.8. EYLEA HD does not contain an anti-microbial preservative."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Increased retinal thickness, assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), is associated with nAMD, DME, and RVO. Reductions in central subfield thickness (CST) were observed across all treatment arms throughout the three Phase 3 studies in nAMD, DME, and RVO. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics EYLEA HD is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, or DME, following intravitreal administration of EYLEA HD, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution As no relevant differences in pharmacokinetics between the nAMD, DME, and RVO populations were observed based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the data, population pharmacokinetic estimated parameters are presented for the combined populations. Following unilateral intravitreal administration of 8 mg aflibercept, the mean (SD) C max of free aflibercept in plasma was 0.32 (0.27) mg/L, and the median time to maximal concentration in plasma was 2.9 days. The accumulation of free aflibercept in plasma following three initial monthly intravitreal doses was minimal (mean accumulation ratio 1.2); subsequently, no further accumulation was observed. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept is approximately 7 L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The median time to reach non-quantifiable concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma for 8 mg administered intravitreally was 3.5 weeks. Specific Populations Renal and Hepatic Impairment Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that systemic exposures to aflibercept in patients with mild to severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to < 90 mL/min, estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation for eGFR were similar to those with normal renal function. Mild hepatic impairment had no influence on systemic exposures to aflibercept compared to patients with normal hepatic function . No data for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are available. No dose adjustment based on renal or hepatic impairment status is needed. Other No dosage adjustment is required for any of the populations that have been studied (e.g., age and race). 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies for other products. During the 48-week treatment with aflibercept administrated IVT, the incidence of anti-aflibercept antibody formation in the 8 mg treatment groups was 2.7% (25/937 participants with nAMD [PULSAR] or DME [PHOTON])."

Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was 91 times higher than the population pharmacokinetic estimated systemic exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at intravitreal doses of 2, 4 or 7 mg per eye.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA HD were assessed in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active-controlled study (PULSAR) in treatment-na\u00efve patients with nAMD. A total of 1009 patients were treated and analyzed for efficacy (673 with EYLEA HD). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) EYLEA HD administered every 12 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (HDq12); 2) EYLEA HD administered every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (HDq16); 3) EYLEA 2 mg administered every 8 weeks (2q8) following 3 initial monthly doses. In the EYLEA HD groups, patients could be treated as frequently as every 8 weeks based on protocol-defined visual and anatomic criteria, starting at week 16. Patients ranged from 50 to 96 years of age with a mean of 74.5 years. At baseline, mean visual acuity was approximately 60 letters (range: 24 to 78 letters). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score. Both HDq12 and HDq16 treatments were shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to 2q8 treatment with respect to the change in BCVA score at week 48 using the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 4 letters. 6.2% of total EYLEA HD treated patients who met protocol-defined criteria to be treated every 8 weeks did not maintain a response with every 8 weeks dosing after successful response to the 3 initial monthly doses. In patients completing week 48, the mean number of injections administered were 5.2 in the HDq16 group (n=312), 6.1 in the HDq12 group (n=316) and 6.9 in the EYLEA q8 group (n=309). Detailed results from the analysis of the PULSAR study are shown in Table 3 and Figure 8 below. Efficacy results in all subgroups (e.g., age, gender, geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline BCVA and lesion type) were consistent with those in the overall population.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) EYLEA HD administered every 12 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (HDq12); 2) EYLEA HD administered every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (HDq16); 3) EYLEA 2 mg administered every 8 weeks (2q8) following 5 initial monthly doses. In the EYLEA HD groups, patients could be treated as frequently as every 8 weeks based on protocol-defined visual and anatomic criteria, starting at week 16. Patient ages ranged from 24 to 90 years with a mean of 62.3 years. A total of 44% of patients were previously treated for DME. At baseline, the overall mean visual acuity was 63 letters (range: 24 to 79 letters). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA at week 48 as measured by the ETDRS letter score. Both HDq12 and HDq16 treatments were shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to 2q8 treatment with respect to the change in BCVA score at week 48 using the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 4 letters. 1.5% of total EYLEA HD treated patients who met protocol-defined criteria to be treated every 8 weeks did not maintain a response with every 8 weeks dosing after successful response to the 3 initial monthly doses.

Baseline ETDRS-DRSS scores were generally balanced across treatment groups. 1.5% of total EYLEA HD treated patients who met protocol-defined criteria to be treated every 8 weeks did not maintain a response with every 8 weeks dosing after successful response to the 3 initial monthly doses. Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS scores at week 48 in the PHOTON study are shown in Table 5 below: Table 5: Proportion of Patients Who Achieved a \u22652-Step Improvement from Baseline in the ETDRS-DRSS Score at Week 48 (Full Analysis Set) in PHOTON Efficacy Outcomes EYLEA HDq12 EYLEA HDq16 EYLEA 2q8 Missing or non-gradable post-baseline ETDRS-DRSS values were imputed using the last gradable ETDRS-DRSS values. Patients were considered as non-responders if all post-baseline measurements were missing or non-gradable. Missing or ungradable baseline was not included in the denominator. Full Analysis Set FAS includes all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication N=328 N=163 N=167 Proportion of patients with a \u22652-step improvement on ETDRS-DRSS from Baseline (%) Last observation carried forward 29% 20% 27% Difference Difference with confidence interval (CI) was calculated using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme (%) (95% CI) 2% (-6.6, 10.6) -8% (-16.9, 1.8) The EYLEA HDq16 did not meet the non-inferiority criteria for the proportion of patients with a \u22652-step improvement on ETDRS-DRSS and is not considered clinically equivalent to EYLEA administered every 8 weeks. Results of the subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity, baseline BCVA and prior DME treatment) on the proportion of patients who achieved a \u22652-step improvement on the ETDRS-DRSS from baseline to week 48 were, in general, consistent with those in the overall population. 14.4 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA HD was assessed in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active-controlled study (QUASAR) in patients with treatment na\u00efve macular edema secondary to RVO. A total of 892 patients (425 with CRVO/HRVO and 467 with BRVO) were treated and analyzed for efficacy (591 with EYLEA HD). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) EYLEA HD administered every 8 weeks, following 3 initial monthly doses (HDq8/3); 2) EYLEA HD administered every 8 weeks, following 5 initial monthly doses (HDq8/5); 3) EYLEA 2 mg administered every 4 weeks (2q4). Dosing intervals could be shortened or extended by 4-week increments based on protocol-defined visual and anatomic criteria. Intervals could be shortened beginning at week 16 for the HDq8/3 group, at week 24 for the HDq8/5 group and, if previously extended, at week 40 for the 2q4 group; intervals could be extended beginning at week 32 for the HDq8/3 and 2q4 groups and at week 40 for the HDq8/5 group. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 95 years with a mean of 65.9 years. At baseline, mean visual acuity was approximately 55 letters (range: 18 to 74 letters). The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in BCVA at week 36 as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score. Both EYLEA HD groups were shown to be non-inferior and clinically equivalent to EYLEA with respect to the change in BCVA score at week 36 using the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 4 letters. 9.1% of total EYLEA HD treated patients met protocol-defined criteria to be treated every 4 weeks. Detailed results from the analysis of the QUASAR study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 10 below. Efficacy results in all subgroups (e.g., age, gender, geographic region, ethnicity, race, baseline BCVA and RVO subtype) were generally consistent with those in the overall population.

Patients should be assessed regularly. 2.3 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for PAVBLU is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ] . 2.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The recommended dose for PAVBLU is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although PAVBLU may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for PAVBLU is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although PAVBLU may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when aflibercept was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.6 Preparation for Administration - Prefilled Syringe The PAVBLU prefilled plastic syringe is sterile and for one-time use in one eye only. The prefilled syringe should be inspected visually prior to administration. It is a clear to opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, or if the package is open or damaged. The appearance of the syringe cap on the prefilled syringe may vary (for example, color and design). Do not use if any part of the prefilled syringe is damaged or if the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock. The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle (not provided). The prefilled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept-ayyh (equivalent to 50 microliters). The excess volume must be discarded prior to the administration. PREFILLED SYRINGE DESCRIPTION - Figure 1: Use aseptic technique to carry out the following steps: 1. PREPARE When ready to administer PAVBLU, open the carton and remove sterilized blister pack. Carefully peel open the sterilized blister pack ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready for assembly. 2. REMOVE SYRINGE Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilized blister pack. 3. TWIST OFF SYRINGE CAP Twist off (do not snap off) the syringe cap by holding the syringe in one hand and the syringe cap with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2: 4. ATTACH NEEDLE Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3: Note: When ready to administer PAVBLU, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 5. DISLODGE AIR BUBBLES Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4: 6. EXPEL AIR AND SET THE DOSE To eliminate all bubbles and to expel excess drug, slowly depress the plunger rod to align the plunger dome edge (see Figure 5a ) with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 50 microliters) (see Figure 5b ). Figure 5a: Figure 5b: 7. The prefilled syringe is for one-time use in one eye only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5a Figure 5b 2.7 Preparation for Administration - Vial PAVBLU should be inspected visually prior to administration. It is a clear to opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the vial must not be used. The glass vial is for one-time use in one eye only. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use: a 5-micron sterile filter needle 18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch (not provided) a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe with marking to measure 0.05 mL (not provided) a sterile injection needle 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch (not provided) 1. Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see Figure 6 ). Figure 6: 2. Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see Figure 7 ). Figure 7: 3. Remove the 18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 8a and Figure 8b ). Figure 8a: Figure 8b: Note: When ready to withdraw PAVBLU, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 4. Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. 5. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the PAVBLU vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see Figure 9a and Figure 9b ). Figure 9a: Figure 9b: 6. Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. 7. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle. Note: Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. 8. Remove the 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 10a and Figure 10b ). Figure 10a: Figure 10b: Note: When ready to administer PAVBLU, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 9. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 11 ). Figure 11: 10. To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod so that the plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (see Figure 12a and Figure 12b ). Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8a Figure 8b Figure 9a & 9b Figure 10a Figure 10b Figure 11 Figure 12a & 12b 2.8 Injection Procedure The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2212spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Prefilled syringe: Inject by pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. A small residual volume may remain in the syringe after a full dose has been injected. This is normal. Do not administer any residual solution observed in the syringe. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Each sterile, prefilled syringe or vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile, prefilled syringe or vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before PAVBLU is administered to the other eye. After injection, any unused product must be discarded."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. ( 5.2 ) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Intravitreal injections, including those with aflibercept products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering PAVBLU. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with aflibercept products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] . 5.4 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including aflibercept products. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the aflibercept group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with aflibercept in the first six months of the RVO studies."

      "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.3) ] Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Inc. at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2980 adult patients treated with aflibercept constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies. Among those, 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The data described below reflect exposure to aflibercept in 1824 patients with wet AMD, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, controlled clinical studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2) for 24 months (with active control in year 1) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Safety data observed in the aflibercept group in a 52-week, double-masked, Phase 2 study were consistent with these results. Table 1.

Safety data observed in 269 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) through week 52 in the PANORAMA trial were consistent with those seen in the phase 3 VIVID and VISTA trials (see Table 3 above). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of aflibercept. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: retinal vasculitis and occlusive retinal vasculitis related to intravitreal injection with aflibercept (reported at a rate of 0.6 and 0.2 per 1 million injections, respectively, based on postmarketing experience from November 2011 until November 2023)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies with aflibercept have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposures (based on AUC for free aflibercept) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose (see Data ) . Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether aflibercept can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , treatment with aflibercept may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. PAVBLU should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses \u22653 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses \u22650.1 mg per kg. Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure (AUC) observed in adult patients after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept products in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, PAVBLU is not recommended during breastfeeding. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAVBLU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PAVBLU. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose, during treatment, and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of PAVBLU. Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of aflibercept on human fertility. Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic level observed in adult patients with an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use A pediatric assessment for PAVBLU demonstrates that PAVBLU is safe and effective for pediatric patients in an indication for which EYLEA (aflibercept) is approved. However, PAVBLU is not approved for such indication due to marketing exclusivity for EYLEA (aflibercept). 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2049/2701) of patients randomized to treatment with aflibercept were \u226565 years of age and approximately 46% (1250/2701) were \u226575 years of age. No significant differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept products act as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF - A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in COPERNICUS, GALILEO, and VIBRANT at week 24 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ] . Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence aflibercept treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Aflibercept is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of aflibercept, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of aflibercept to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean C max of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post - dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half - maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6 L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target - mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half - life (t 1/2 ) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients. Other No dosage modification is required based on gender or in the elderly. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of aflibercept or of other aflibercept products. In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre - treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to aflibercept was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with aflibercept for 24 - 100 weeks, antibodies to aflibercept were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity."

Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at intravitreal doses of 2 or 4 mg per eye.

In each study, up to week 52, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); 3) aflibercept 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks (aflibercept 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b13 days. Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years with a mean of 76 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group in year 1. Detailed results from the analysis of the VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies are shown in Table 4 and Figure 13 below. Table 4.

Figure 13. Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Week 96 Patient dosing schedules were individualized from weeks 52 to 96 using a modified 12-week dosing regimen. in VIEW1 and VIEW2 Studies VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies were both 96 weeks in duration. However after 52 weeks patients no longer followed a fixed dosing schedule. Between week 52 and week 96, patients continued to receive the drug and dosage strength to which they were initially randomized on a modified 12 week dosing schedule (doses at least every 12 weeks and additional doses as needed). Therefore, during the second year of these studies there was no active control comparison arm. Figure 13 14.2 Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled studies in patients with macular edema following CRVO. A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with aflibercept) in the two studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO). In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA compared to baseline. At week 24, the aflibercept 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint. Results from the analysis of the COPERNICUS and GALILEO studies are shown in Table 5 and Figure 14 below. Table 5.

Figure 14 14.3 Macular Edema Following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in a 24-week, randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with macular edema following BRVO. A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with aflibercept) in the VIBRANT study. In the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4) or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline and subsequently as needed (control group). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years. In the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. At week 24, the aflibercept 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint. Detailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 15 below.

Figure 15 14.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled studies in patients with DME. A total of 862 randomized and treated patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years. Of those, 576 were randomized to aflibercept groups in the two studies (VIVID and VISTA). In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); and 3) macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment: patients in the aflibercept groups could receive laser and patients in the laser group could receive aflibercept. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 52 as measured by ETDRS letter score. Efficacy of both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups was statistically superior to the control group. This statistically superior improvement in BCVA was maintained at week 100 in both studies. Results from the analysis of the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 7 and Figure 16 below. Table 7.

Mean Change in BCVA as Measured by ETDRS Letter Score from Baseline to Week 100 in VIVID and VISTA Studies Treatment effects in the subgroup of patients who had previously been treated with a VEGF inhibitor prior to study participation were similar to those seen in patients who were VEGF inhibitor na\u00efve prior to study participation. Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity, prior anti-VEGF therapy) in each study were in general consistent with the results in the overall populations. Figure 16 14.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of aflibercept in diabetic retinopathy (DR) are derived from the VIVID, VISTA, and PANORAMA studies. VIVID AND VISTA In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both aflibercept treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group. Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 8 below. Table 8. Proportion of Patients Who Achieved a \u22652-Step Improvement from Baseline in the ETDRS-DRSS Score at Week 100 in VIVID and VISTA Studies VIVID VISTA Aflibercept 2 mg Q8 weeks After treatment initiation with 5 monthly injections Aflibercept 2 mg Q4 weeks Control Aflibercept 2 mg Q8 weeks Aflibercept 2 mg Q4 weeks Control Evaluable Patients The number of evaluable patients included all patients who had valid ETDRS-DRSS data at baseline N=101 N=97 N=99 N=148 N=153 N=150 Non-gradable post-baseline ETDRS-DRSS values were treated as missing and were imputed using the last gradable ETDRS-DRSS values (including baseline values if all post-baseline values were missing or non-gradable) Number of patients with a \u22652-step improvement on ETDRS-DRSS from Baseline (%) 32 27 7 56 58 24 (32%) (28%) (7%) (38%) (38%) (16%) Difference Difference with confidence interval (CI) was calculated using Mantel-Haenszel weighting scheme adjusted by protocol specified stratification factors , Difference is aflibercept minus Control group (%) (97.5% CI) 24% p<0.01 compared with Control (12, 36) 21% (9, 33) 22% (11, 33) 22% (11, 33) Results of the evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity) on the proportion of patients who achieved a \u22652-step improvement on the ETDRS-DRSS from baseline to week 100 were, in general, consistent with those in the overall population. PANORAMA The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and efficacy of aflibercept in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS of 47 or 53), without central-involved DME (CI-DME). A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days for the first 5 visits, then every 8 weeks (56\u00b17 days). Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55.7 years. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) 3 initial monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks (aflibercept 2Q16); 2) 5 monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks (aflibercept 2Q8); and 3) sham treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by \u22652 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined aflibercept groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52. At week 52, efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group (see Table 9 and Table 10 ). The proportion of patients with a \u22652-step improvement over time is shown in Figure 17.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage : Severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhage, including gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, has been reported in patients who have received ZALTRAP. Do not administer ZALTRAP to patients with severe hemorrhage. ( 5.1 ) Gastrointestinal Perforation : Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who experience GI perforation. ( 5.2 ) Impaired Wound Healing : Withhold ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 4 weeks following major surgery and until wounds have adequately healed. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with impaired wound healing. The safety of resumption of ZALTRAP after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.3 ) Fistula Formation : Discontinue ZALTRAP if fistula occurs. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure and treat hypertension. Temporarily suspend ZALTRAP if hypertension is not controlled. Discontinue ZALTRAP if hypertensive crisis develops. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATE) : Discontinue ZALTRAP if ATE develops. ( 5.6 ) Proteinuria : Monitor urine protein. Suspend ZALTRAP for proteinuria of 2 grams per 24 hours or more. Discontinue ZALTRAP if nephrotic syndrome or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) develops. ( 2.2 , 5.7 ) Neutropenia and Neutropenic Complications : Delay administration of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI until neutrophil count is 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L or higher. ( 5.8 ) Diarrhea and Dehydration : Incidence of severe diarrhea and dehydration is increased. Monitor elderly patients more closely. ( 5.9 , 8.5 ) Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome : Discontinue ZALTRAP. ( 5.10 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of potential risk to fetus and need for use of effective contraception. ( 5.11 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Patients treated with ZALTRAP have an increased risk of hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events. In patients with mCRC, bleeding/hemorrhage (all grades) was reported in 38% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3\u20134 hemorrhagic events, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and post-procedural hemorrhage, were reported in 3% of patients receiving ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared with 1% of patients receiving placebo/FOLFIRI. Severe intracranial hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage/hemoptysis including fatal events have also occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Do not initiate ZALTRAP in patients with severe hemorrhage. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop severe hemorrhage [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforation Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation including fatal GI perforation can occur in patients receiving ZALTRAP. Across three placebo-controlled clinical studies (colorectal, pancreatic, and lung cancer populations), the incidence of GI perforation (all grades) was 0.8% for patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.3% for patients treated with placebo. Grade 3\u20134 GI perforation occurred in 0.8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of GI perforation. Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who experience GI perforation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.3 Impaired Wound Healing Grade 3 impaired wound healing was reported in 2 patients (0.3%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen. Withhold ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer ZALTRAP for at least 4 weeks after major surgery and until wounds have adequately healed. For minor surgery such as central venous access port placement, biopsy, and tooth extraction, ZALTRAP may be initiated/resumed once the surgical wound is fully healed. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with impaired wound healing. The safety of resumption of ZALTRAP after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.4 Fistula Formation Fistula formation involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal sites occurs at a higher incidence in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, fistulas (anal, enterovesical, enterocutaneous, colovaginal, intestinal sites) were reported in 9 of 611 patients (1.5%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen and 3 of 605 patients (0.5%) treated with placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. Grade 3 GI fistula formation occurred in 2 patients treated with ZALTRAP (0.3%) and in 1 patient treated with placebo (0.2%). Discontinue ZALTRAP therapy in patients who develop fistula [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.5 Hypertension ZALTRAP increases the risk of Grade 3\u20134 hypertension. There is no clinical trial experience administering ZALTRAP to patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3 hypertension (defined as requiring adjustment in existing antihypertensive therapy or treatment with more than one drug) was reported in 1.5% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI and 19% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) was reported in 1 patient (0.2%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. Among those patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI developing Grade 3\u20134 hypertension, 54% had onset during the first two cycles of treatment. Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as clinically indicated during treatment with ZALTRAP. Treat with appropriate antihypertensive therapy and continue monitoring blood pressure regularly. Temporarily suspend ZALTRAP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension until controlled and permanently reduce the ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg per kg for subsequent cycles. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Arterial Thromboembolic Events ATE, including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, and angina pectoris, occurred more frequently in patients who have received ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, ATE was reported in 2.6% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 1.7% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3\u20134 events occurred in 11 patients (1.8%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 4 patients (0.7%) treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who experience an ATE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.7 Proteinuria Severe proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) occurred more frequently in patients treated with ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, proteinuria was reported in 62% patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 41% patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3\u20134 proteinuria occurred in 8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 1% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Nephrotic syndrome occurred in 2 patients (0.5%) treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to none of the patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. TMA was reported in 3 of 2258 patients with cancer enrolled across completed studies. Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick analysis and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) for the development or worsening of proteinuria during ZALTRAP therapy. Patients with a dipstick of \u22652+ for protein or a UPCR greater than 1 should undergo a 24-hour urine collection. Suspend ZALTRAP administration for proteinuria 2 grams per 24 hours or more, and resume when proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours. If recurrent, suspend until proteinuria is less than 2 grams per 24 hours and then permanently reduce the ZALTRAP dose to 2 mg per kg. Discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome or TMA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.8 Neutropenia and Neutropenic Complications A higher incidence of neutropenic complications (febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection) occurred in patients receiving ZALTRAP. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3\u20134 neutropenia occurred in 37% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 30% patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Grade 3\u20134 febrile neutropenia occurred in 4% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 2% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3\u20134 neutropenic infection/sepsis occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 1.2% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Monitor CBC with differential count at baseline and prior to initiation of each cycle of ZALTRAP. Delay ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI until neutrophil count is at or above 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L. 5.9 Diarrhea and Dehydration The incidence of severe diarrhea is increased in patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. In patients with mCRC, Grade 3\u20134 diarrhea was reported in 19% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 8% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3\u20134 dehydration was reported in 4% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to 1% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The incidence of diarrhea is increased in patients who are age 65 years or older as compared to patients younger than 65 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Monitor elderly patients closely for diarrhea. 5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome RPLS (also known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) was reported in 0.5% of 3795 patients treated with ZALTRAP monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Confirm the diagnosis of RPLS with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and discontinue ZALTRAP in patients who develop RPLS. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae or death [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ZALTRAP can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Administration of ziv-aflibercept during the period of organogenesis was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rabbits at exposure levels approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the 4 mg per kg dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZALTRAP and for 3 months following the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Gastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Impaired Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Fistula Formation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Arterial Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Neutropenia and Neutropenic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Diarrhea and Dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u226520% incidence) were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI was evaluated in VELOUR (EFC102621) [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Patients received ZALTRAP 4 mg per kg (N=611) or placebo (N=605) intravenously every two weeks (one cycle) in combination with FOLFIRI. Patients received a median of 9 cycles of ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. The most common Grade 3\u20134 adverse reactions (\u22655%) in the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, hypertension, leukopenia, stomatitis, fatigue, proteinuria, and asthenia. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in \u22651% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI regimen were asthenia/fatigue, infections, diarrhea, dehydration, hypertension, stomatitis, venous thromboembolic events, neutropenia, and proteinuria. The ZALTRAP dose was reduced and/or omitted in 17% of patients. Cycle delays >7 days occurred in 60% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in the ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI arm were leukopenia, diarrhea, neutropenia, proteinuria, AST increased, stomatitis, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, ALT increased, hypertension, weight decreased, decreased appetite, epistaxis, abdominal pain, dysphonia, serum creatinine increased, and headache. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred in \u22655% (all grades) of patients receiving ZALTRAP in combination with FOLFIRI and which occurred at \u22652% higher frequency in patients who received ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI compared to those who received placebo/FOLFIRI in VELOUR are shown in Table 1. VELOUR was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI as compared to placebo/FOLFIRI for any adverse reactions listed below.

In patients with mCRC, severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI (0.3%) and placebo/FOLFIRI (0.5%). In patients with mCRC, venous thromboembolic events (VTE), consisting primarily of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, occurred in 9% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 7% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Grade 3\u20134 VTE occurred in 8% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and in 6% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. Pulmonary embolism occurred in 5% of patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI and 3.4% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In patients with various cancers across 15 studies, 1.4% (41/2862) of patients tested positive for antiproduct antibody (APA) at baseline. The incidence of APA development was 3.1% (53/1687) in patients receiving intravenous ziv-aflibercept and 1.7% (19/1134) in patients receiving placebo. Among patients who tested positive for APA and had sufficient samples for further testing, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 17 of 48 ziv-aflibercept-treated patients and in 2 of 40 patients receiving placebo. The mean free ziv-aflibercept trough concentrations were lower in patients with positive neutralizing antibodies than in the overall population. The impact of neutralizing antibodies on efficacy and safety could not be assessed based on limited available data. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ZALTRAP. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Osteonecrosis of the jaw Cardiac disorders : Cardiac failure, ejection fraction decreased Vascular disorders : Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , ZALTRAP can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to ZALTRAP to assess the risks. Administration of ziv-aflibercept during the period of organogenesis was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rabbits at exposure levels approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the 4 mg per kg dose (see Data ) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal data In pregnant rabbits, administration of ziv-aflibercept during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increase in postimplantation loss and external (including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia and gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, and anal atresia), visceral (heart, great vessels, and arteries), and skeletal fetal malformations (including fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs, supernumerary arches and ribs, and incomplete ossification) at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg per kg, administered once every 3 days (approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the 4 mg per kg dose based on AUC). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ziv-aflibercept in human milk, or the effects of ziv-aflibercept on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ZALTRAP and for 1 month following the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential ZALTRAP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ZALTRAP [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Contraception Females Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ZALTRAP can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZALTRAP and for 3 months following the last dose. Infertility Advise female and male patients of reproductive potential that ZALTRAP may impair reproductive function and fertility [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety and efficacy were assessed, but not established in a dose-escalation, safety, and tolerability study (NCT00622414) in 21 patients with solid tumors 2 to 21 years of age (median age 12.9). The mean elimination half-life of free ziv-aflibercept determined after the first dose in 8 pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years was within the range of values previously observed in adults. The maximum tolerated dose based on body weight in these pediatric patients was lower than the dose known to be safe and effective in adults with mCRC. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Weekly/every-two-weeks intravenous administration of ziv-aflibercept at dose of 3 mg per kg (approximately 0.6 times the human exposure at the 4 mg per kg dose based on AUC) to growing young adult (sexually mature) cynomolgus monkeys for up to 6 months resulted in changes in the bone (effects on growth plate and the axial and appendicular skeleton), nasal cavity (atrophy/loss of the septum and/or turbinates), kidney (glomerulopathy with inflammation), ovary (decreased number of maturing follicles, granulosa cells, and/or theca cells), and adrenal gland (decreased vacuolation with inflammation). In another study in sexually immature cynomolgus monkeys (treated intravenously for 3 months), there were similar effects. The skeletal and nasal cavity effects were not reversible after a post-dosing recovery period. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 611 patients with mCRC, patients treated with ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI, 205 (34%) were 65 years or older, and 33 (5%) were 75 years or older. Elderly patients (\u226565 years of age) experienced higher incidences (\u22655%) of diarrhea, dizziness, asthenia, weight decrease, and dehydration when compared to younger patients. Monitor elderly patients more closely for diarrhea and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. The effect of ZALTRAP on overall survival was similar in patients <65 years old and \u226565 years old who received ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times upper limit normal [ULN] and any aspartate transaminase [AST]) and moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

      "11 DESCRIPTION Ziv-aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. It is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF Receptors 1 and 2 fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1. Ziv-aflibercept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K-1 mammalian expression system. Ziv-aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kilodaltons (kDa) and contains glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular weight of 115 kDa. ZALTRAP (ziv-aflibercept) injection is a sterile, clear, colorless to pale-yellow, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, solution for intravenous use. ZALTRAP is supplied in single-dose vials of 100 mg/4 mL and 200 mg/8 mL formulated as 25 mg/mL ziv-aflibercept in polysorbate 20 (1 mg/mL), sodium chloride (5.84 mg/mL), sodium citrate (1.45 mg/mL), sodium phosphate (0.8 mg/mL), and sucrose (200 mg/mL), in Water for Injection, USP, at a pH of 6.2."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Ziv-aflibercept acts as a soluble receptor that binds to human VEGF-A (equilibrium dissociation constant K D of 0.5 pM for VEGF-A 165 and 0.36 pM for VEGF-A 121 ), to human VEGF-B (K D of 1.92 pM), and to human PlGF (K D of 39 pM for PlGF-2). By binding to these endogenous ligands, ziv-aflibercept can inhibit the binding and activation of their cognate receptors. This inhibition can result in decreased neovascularization and decreased vascular permeability. In animals, ziv-aflibercept was shown to inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels. Ziv-aflibercept inhibited the growth of xenotransplanted colon tumors in mice. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of 6 mg per kg intravenous ZALTRAP every three weeks on QTc interval was evaluated in 87 patients with solid tumors in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. No large changes in the mean QT interval from baseline (i.e., greater than 20 ms as corrected for placebo) based on Fridericia correction method were detected in the study. However, a small increase in the mean QTc interval (i.e., less than 10 ms) cannot be excluded due to limitations of the study design. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma concentrations of free and VEGF-bound ziv-aflibercept were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Free ziv-aflibercept concentrations appear to exhibit linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 2 mg per kg to 9 mg per kg. Steady state concentrations of free ziv-aflibercept were reached by the second dose. The accumulation ratio for free ziv-aflibercept was approximately 1.2 after administration of 4 mg per kg every two weeks. Elimination Following a dose of 4 mg per kg every two weeks administered intravenously, the elimination half-life of free ziv-aflibercept was approximately 6 days (range 4\u20137 days). Specific Populations Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, race, and sex did not have a clinically important effect on the exposure of free ziv-aflibercept. Patients weighing \u2265100 kg had a 29% increase in systemic exposure compared to patients weighing 50 to 100 kg. Patients with hepatic impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST, n=63) and moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST, n=5) hepatic impairment, there was no effect of total bilirubin, AST, and alanine aminotransferase on the clearance of free ziv-aflibercept. There are no data available for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST). Patients with renal impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included patients with mild (CL CR 50\u201380 mL/min, n=549), moderate (CL CR 30\u201350 mL/min, n=96), and severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min, n=5), there was no clinically important effect of creatinine clearance on the clearance of free ziv-aflibercept. Drug Interaction Studies No clinically meaningful interaction was found between ziv-aflibercept and irinotecan or fluorouracil based on cross-study comparisons and population pharmacokinetic analyses."

Patients weighing \u2265100 kg had a 29% increase in systemic exposure compared to patients weighing 50 to 100 kg. Patients with hepatic impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included patients with mild (total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST, n=63) and moderate (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST, n=5) hepatic impairment, there was no effect of total bilirubin, AST, and alanine aminotransferase on the clearance of free ziv-aflibercept. There are no data available for patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST). Patients with renal impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included patients with mild (CL CR 50\u201380 mL/min, n=549), moderate (CL CR 30\u201350 mL/min, n=96), and severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min, n=5), there was no clinically important effect of creatinine clearance on the clearance of free ziv-aflibercept. Drug Interaction Studies No clinically meaningful interaction was found between ziv-aflibercept and irinotecan or fluorouracil based on cross-study comparisons and population pharmacokinetic analyses."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate carcinogenicity or mutagenicity of ziv-aflibercept. Ziv-aflibercept impaired reproductive function and fertility in monkeys. In a 6-month repeat-dose toxicology study in sexually mature monkeys, ziv-aflibercept inhibited ovarian function and follicular development, as evidenced by: decreased ovary weight, decreased amount of luteal tissue, decreased number of maturing follicles, atrophy of uterine endometrium and myometrium, vaginal atrophy, abrogation of progesterone peaks and menstrual bleeding. Alterations in sperm morphology and decreased sperm motility were present in male monkeys. These effects were observed at all doses tested including the lowest dose tested, 3 mg per kg. Reversibility was observed within 18 weeks after cessation of treatment. Systemic exposure (AUC) with a 3 mg per kg per dose in monkeys was approximately 0.6 times the AUC in patients at the 4 mg per kg dose. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Repeated administration of ziv-aflibercept resulted in a delay in wound healing in rabbits. In full-thickness excisional and incisional skin wound models, ziv-aflibercept administration reduced fibrous response, neovascularization, epidermal hyperplasia/re-epithelialization, and tensile strength."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ZALTRAP was evaluated in VELOUR (NCT00561470), a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with mCRC who are resistant to or have progressed during or within 6 months of receiving oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy, with or without prior bevacizumab. Patients were randomized to receive either ZALTRAP 4 mg per kg intravenously over 1 hour on day 1 or placebo in combination with FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 intravenously over 90 minutes and leucovorin [dl racemic] 400 mg/m 2 intravenously over 2 hours at the same time on day 1 using a Y-line, followed by fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 as an intravenous bolus and then by fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 2 as a continuous intravenous infusion over 46 hours). The treatment cycles on both arms were repeated every 2 weeks. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) (0 versus 1 versus 2) and according to prior therapy with bevacizumab (yes or no). The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR). Demographics characteristics were similar between treatment arms. A total of 1226 patients were randomized, 612 to the ZALTRAP arm and 614 to the placebo arm. The median age was 61 years, 59% were men, 87% were White, 7% were Asian, 3.5% were Black, and 98% had a baseline ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Among the 1226 randomized patients, 89% and 90% of patients treated with placebo/FOLFIRI and ZALTRAP/FOLFIRI, respectively, received prior oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy in the metastatic/advanced setting. A total of 346 patients (28%) received bevacizumab in combination with the prior oxaliplatin-based treatment. Efficacy results are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 3 months, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). ( 2.5 ) Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months). ( 2.5 ) Although not as effective as the recommended every 8 week dosing regimen, patients may also be treated with one dose every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy. Patients should be assessed regularly. ( 2.5 ) Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly). ( 2.6 ) Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). ( 2.7 , 2.8 ) Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). (2.7 , 2.8 ) Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 0.4 mg (0.01 mL or 10 microliters of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection. Treatment may be given bilaterally on the same day. Injections may be repeated in each eye. The treatment interval between doses injected into the same eye should be at least 10 days. ( 2.9 ) 2.1 Important Injection Instructions For ophthalmic intravitreal injection. EYLEA must only be administered by a qualified physician. Pre-filled Syringe: A 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle is needed but not provided. Vial: A 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch), a 1-mL Luer lock syringe and a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch sterile injection needle are needed. EYLEA is available packaged as follows: Pre-filled Syringe Vial Kit with Injection Components (filter needle, syringe, injection needle) [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ]. 2.2 Preparation for Administration \u2013 Pre-filled Syringe The EYLEA pre-filled glass syringe is sterile and for one-time use in one eye only. Do not use the EYLEA pre-filled syringe for the treatment of ROP. The pre-filled syringe should be inspected visually prior to administration. Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, or if the package is open or damaged. The appearance of the syringe cap on the pre-filled syringe may vary (for example, color and design). Do not use if any part of the pre-filled syringe is damaged or if the syringe cap is detached from the Luer lock. The intravitreal injection should be performed with a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle (not provided). The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 2 mg aflibercept (equivalent to 50 microliters). The excess volume must be discarded prior to the administration. PRE-FILLED SYRINGE DESCRIPTION \u2013 Figure 1: Use aseptic technique to carry out the following steps: 1. PREPARE When ready to administer EYLEA, open the carton and remove sterilized blister pack. Carefully peel open the sterilized blister pack ensuring the sterility of its contents. Keep the syringe in the sterile tray until you are ready for assembly. 2. REMOVE SYRINGE Using aseptic technique, remove the syringe from the sterilized blister pack. 3. TWIST OFF SYRINGE CAP Twist off (do not snap off) the syringe cap by holding the syringe in one hand and the syringe cap with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand (see Figure 2 ). Note: To avoid compromising the sterility of the product, do not pull back on the plunger. Figure 2: 4. ATTACH NEEDLE Using aseptic technique, firmly twist a 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3: Note: When ready to administer EYLEA, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. 5. DISLODGE AIR BUBBLES Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 4 ). Figure 4: 6. EXPEL AIR AND SET THE DOSE To eliminate all bubbles and to expel excess drug, slowly depress the plunger rod to align the plunger dome edge (see Figure 5a ) with the black dosing line on the syringe (equivalent to 50 microliters) (see Figure 5b ). Figure 5a: Figure 5b: 7. The pre-filled syringe is for one-time use in one eye only. After injection any unused product must be discarded. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5a Figure 5b 2.3 Preparation for Administration - Vial EYLEA should be inspected visually prior to administration. If particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible, the vial must not be used. The glass vial is for one-time use in one eye only. Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps: Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use: a 5-micron sterile filter needle (18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch) a 1-mL sterile Luer lock syringe with marking to measure 0.05 mL for adults or 0.01 mL for pre-term infants with ROP a sterile injection needle (30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch) Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial (see Figure 6 ). Figure 6: Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe (see Figure 7 ). Figure 7: Remove the 18-gauge \u00d7 1\u00bd-inch, 5-micron, filter needle and the 1-mL syringe from their packaging. Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 8 ). Figure 8: Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial. Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the EYLEA vial contents into the syringe, keeping the vial in an upright position, slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal. To deter the introduction of air, ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid. Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid (see Figure 9a and Figure 9b ). Figure 9a: Figure 9b: Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle. Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle. Note : Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection. Remove the 30-gauge \u00d7 \u00bd-inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip (see Figure 10 ). Figure 10: When ready to administer EYLEA, remove the plastic needle shield from the needle. Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up, check the syringe for bubbles. If there are bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see Figure 11 ). Figure 11: Administration in Adults: To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod so that the plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.05 mL on the syringe (see Figure 12a and Figure 12b ). Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9a Figure 9b Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12a and b 2.4 Injection Procedure for Adults The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Pre-filled syringe : Inject by pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure. Do not apply additional pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe. A small residual volume may remain in the syringe after a full dose has been injected. This is normal. Do not administer any residual solution observed in the syringe. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each sterile, pre-filled syringe or vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile, pre-filled syringe or vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before EYLEA is administered to the other eye. After injection, any unused product must be discarded. 2.5 Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 12 weeks (3 months). Although not as effective as the recommended every 8 week dosing regimen, patients may also be treated with one dose every 12 weeks after one year of effective therapy. Patients should be assessed regularly. 2.6 Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection once every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. 2.7 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.8 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) The recommended dose for EYLEA is 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (approximately every 28 days, monthly) for the first 5 injections, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL of 40 mg/mL solution) via intravitreal injection once every 8 weeks (2 months). Although EYLEA may be dosed as frequently as 2 mg every 4 weeks (approximately every 25 days, monthly), additional efficacy was not demonstrated in most patients when EYLEA was dosed every 4 weeks compared to every 8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Some patients may need every 4 week (monthly) dosing after the first 20 weeks (5 months). 2.9 Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Recommended Dosage The recommended dose for EYLEA is 0.4 mg (0.01 mL or 10 microliters of 40 mg/mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection. Treatment is initiated with a single injection per eligible eye and may be given bilaterally on the same day. Injections may be repeated in each eye. The treatment interval between doses injected into the same eye should be at least 10 days [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. Administration Instructions in Pre-Term Infants with ROP The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad\u2013spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection. Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available. Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Each sterile vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. Do not use the EYLEA pre-filled syringe for the treatment of ROP. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before EYLEA is administered to the other eye. Follow steps 1-10 listed in 2.3 Preparation for Administration \u2013 Vial. 11 . To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug, SLOWLY depress the plunger rod so that the plunger edge aligns with the line that marks 0.01 mL on the syringe (see Figure 13a and Figure 13b ). For the treatment of ROP, the injection needle should be inserted into the eye 1 mm from the limbus with the needle angled to avoid the lens and to avoid the retina. After injection, any unused product must be discarded. Figure 13a and b"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. ( 5.2 ) In infants with ROP, treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring ( 5.3 ) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Intravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Extended Monitoring and Additional Treatment in ROP Reactivation of abnormal angiogenesis and tortuosity may occur following treatment with EYLEA. Infants should be monitored closely after injection with EYLEA until retinal vascularization has completed or until the examiner is assured that reactivation of ROP will not occur. In infants with ROP, treatment with EYLEA will necessitate extended periods of ROP monitoring and additional EYLEA injections and/or laser treatments may be necessary. 5.4 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.3) ] Endophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Regeneron at 1-855-395-3248 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2980 adult patients treated with EYLEA constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies. Among those, 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The data described below reflect exposure to EYLEA in 1824 patients with wet AMD, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, controlled clinical studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2) for 24 months (with active control in year 1) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Safety data observed in the EYLEA group in a 52-week, double-masked, Phase 2 study were consistent with these results.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well-controlled studies with EYLEA have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposures (based on AUC for free aflibercept) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose [see Animal Data ]. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether EYLEA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ], treatment with EYLEA may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. EYLEA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses \u22653 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses \u22650.1 mg per kg. Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure (AUC) observed in adult patients after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production/excretion. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists, EYLEA is not recommended during breastfeeding. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for EYLEA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EYLEA. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose, during treatment, and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of EYLEA. Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of EYLEA on human fertility. Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic level observed in adult patients with an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EYLEA have been demonstrated in two clinical studies of pre-term infants with ROP. These two studies randomized pre-term infants between initial treatment with EYLEA or laser. Efficacy of each treatment is supported by the demonstration of a clinical course which was better than would have been expected without treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies, approximately 76% (2049/2701) of patients randomized to treatment with EYLEA were \u226565 years of age and approximately 46% (1250/2701) were \u226575 years of age. No significant differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kilodaltons (kDa) and contains glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular weight of 115 kDa. Aflibercept is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. EYLEA (aflibercept) Injection is a sterile, clear, and colorless to pale yellow solution. EYLEA does not contain anti-microbial preservative and is supplied as a sterile, aqueous solution for intravitreal injection in a single-dose pre-filled glass syringe or a single-dose glass vial designed to deliver 0.05 mL (50 microliters) of solution containing 2 mg of aflibercept in polysorbate 20 (0.015 mg), sodium chloride (0.117 mg), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (0.055 mg), sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate (0.027 mg), sucrose (2.5 mg) and water for injection with a pH of 6.2."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year. Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in COPERNICUS, GALILEO, and VIBRANT at week 24 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.2) , (14.3) ]. Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline. Anatomic data were not used to influence EYLEA treatment decisions [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics EYLEA is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of EYLEA, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of EYLEA to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean C max of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of aflibercept were evaluated in pre-term infants with ROP at a dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (per eye) administered unilaterally or bilaterally. In the BUTTERFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma declined from a maximum of 0.583 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.0406 mcg/mL at Day 28 in bilaterally treated patients. In the FIREFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma for all patients (bilateral and unilateral administration combined) declined from a maximum of 0.481 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.13 mcg/mL at Day 28. Concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma subsequently declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation within approximately 8 weeks. Following an IVT dose of aflibercept 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at 10 or 14 day intervals, the population pharmacokinetic estimated mean maximal accumulation ratio of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 2.0 and 1.4. No accumulation of free aflibercept in plasma is expected for IVT doses of 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at dosing intervals of 21 days or longer. Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients . Other No dosage modification is required based on gender or in the elderly. 12.6 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with EYLEA. The immunogenicity of EYLEA was evaluated in serum samples. The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to EYLEA in immunoassays. The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to EYLEA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to EYLEA was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with EYLEA for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to EYLEA were detected in a similar percentage range of patients. Similarly, after unilateral or bilateral dosing in pediatric ROP studies, antibodies to EYLEA were detected in less than 1% of patients. There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability. Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics EYLEA is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of EYLEA, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex). Absorption/Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of EYLEA to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean C max of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF. The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L. Metabolism/Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted. Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of aflibercept were evaluated in pre-term infants with ROP at a dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept (per eye) administered unilaterally or bilaterally. In the BUTTERFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma declined from a maximum of 0.583 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.0406 mcg/mL at Day 28 in bilaterally treated patients. In the FIREFLEYE study, mean concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma for all patients (bilateral and unilateral administration combined) declined from a maximum of 0.481 mcg/mL at Day 1 to 0.13 mcg/mL at Day 28. Concentrations of free aflibercept in plasma subsequently declined to values below or close to the lower limit of quantitation within approximately 8 weeks. Following an IVT dose of aflibercept 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at 10 or 14 day intervals, the population pharmacokinetic estimated mean maximal accumulation ratio of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 2.0 and 1.4. No accumulation of free aflibercept in plasma is expected for IVT doses of 0.4 mg per eye given bilaterally at dosing intervals of 21 days or longer. Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients (n=492) in one wet AMD study, of which 43% had renal impairment (mild n=120, moderate n=74, and severe n=16), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients .

Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at intravitreal doses of 2 or 4 mg per eye. At the NOAEL of 0.5 mg per eye in monkeys, the systemic exposure (AUC) was 56 times higher than the exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg and 2-fold higher based on C max when compared to corresponding values observed in pre-term infants from FIREFLEYE.

A total of 2412 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (1817 with EYLEA) in the two studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2). In each study, up to week 52, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 1) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (EYLEA 2Q8); 2) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (EYLEA 2Q4); 3) EYLEA 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks (EYLEA 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b13 days. Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years with a mean of 76 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both EYLEA 2Q8 and EYLEA 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group in year 1. Detailed results from the analysis of the VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies are shown in Table 5 and Figure 14 below.

Figure 14: Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Week 96* in VIEW1 and VIEW2 Studies *Patient dosing schedules were individualized from weeks 52 to 96 using a modified 12-week dosing regimen. VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies were both 96 weeks in duration. However, after 52 weeks patients no longer followed a fixed dosing schedule. Between week 52 and week 96, patients continued to receive the drug and dosage strength to which they were initially randomized on a modified 12 week dosing schedule (doses at least every 12 weeks and additional doses as needed). Therefore, during the second year of these studies there was no active control comparison arm. Figure 14 14.2 Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled studies in patients with macular edema following CRVO. A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with EYLEA) in the two studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO). In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg EYLEA administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA compared to baseline.

Figure 16 14.4 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled studies in patients with DME. A total of 862 randomized and treated patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years. Of those, 576 were randomized to EYLEA groups in the two studies (VIVID and VISTA). In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (EYLEA 2Q8); 2) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (EYLEA 2Q4); and 3) macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre-specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment: patients in the EYLEA groups could receive laser and patients in the laser group could receive EYLEA. In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 52 as measured by ETDRS letter score. Efficacy of both EYLEA 2Q8 and EYLEA 2Q4 groups was statistically superior to the control group. This statistically superior improvement in BCVA was maintained at week 100 in both studies.

Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity, prior anti-VEGF therapy) in each study were in general consistent with the results in the overall populations. Figure 17 14.5 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) Efficacy and safety data of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy (DR) are derived from the VIVID, VISTA, and PANORAMA studies. VIVID AND VISTA In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both EYLEA treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group. Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 9 below.

PANORAMA The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and efficacy of EYLEA in a randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) (ETDRS-DRSS of 47 or 53), without central-involved DME (CI-DME). A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28\u00b17 days for the first 5 visits, then every 8 weeks (56\u00b17 days). Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55.7 years. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) 3 initial monthly EYLEA 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks (EYLEA 2Q16); 2) 5 monthly EYLEA 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks (EYLEA 2Q8); and 3) sham treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by \u22652 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined EYLEA groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52. At week 52, efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group (see Table 10 and Table 11 ).

BUTTERFLEYE was a 52-week study. FIREFLEYE included 24 weeks of treatment and follow-up. FIREFLEYE NEXT was an observational follow-up of FIREFLEYE through week 52. Both BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE studies assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of EYLEA in randomized, 2-arm, open-label, parallel-group studies. The studies were conducted in pre-term infants with ROP providing a comparison between EYLEA treatment and laser photocoagulation therapy (laser). Each eligible eye received the assigned study treatment at baseline. Re-treatment and/or rescue treatment was administered if needed based on pre-specified criteria. Rescue treatment could potentially include the alternative treatment (EYLEA or laser). Re-treatment with aflibercept, if required, was administered up to 2 times in a particular eye, with at least 28 days between consecutive injections. Eligible patients had a maximum gestational age at birth of 32 weeks or a maximum birth weight of 1500 g, had to weigh > 800 g on the day of treatment and had treatment-na\u00efve ROP classified according to the International Classification for Retinopathy of Prematurity (IC-ROP 2005) in at least one eye with one of the following retinal findings: ROP Zone 1 Stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+, or ROP Zone II Stage 2+ or 3+, or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) The primary efficacy endpoint of each study was the proportion of patients with absence of active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes (retinal detachment, macular dragging, macular fold, retrolental opacity) at week 52 of chronological age. In BUTTERFLEYE, patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens: 1) EYLEA 0.4 mg at baseline and if required, up to 2 additional injections and 2) laser photocoagulation in each eye at baseline and if required, retreatment. In FIREFLEYE, patients were randomized to the same two treatments, but in a 2:1 ratio. Rescue treatment was administered if required, per pre-specified criteria. In both studies, greater than 92% of all treated patients in the aflibercept group received bilateral injections during the study. Results from week 52 of chronological age in the BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE/FIREFLEYE NEXT studies are shown in Table 12 below. The proportion of patients without clinically significant reactivations of ROP who also did not develop unfavorable structural outcomes was higher in each arm of each study than would have been expected in infants who had not received treatment. Neither trial demonstrated superiority of one arm compared to the other arm. Neither trial demonstrated inferiority of one arm compared to the other arm. Table 12: Efficacy Outcomes at Week 52 Chronological Age in BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE/FIREFLEYE NEXT Studies BUTTERFLEYE In case of bilateral treatment, success was achieved only if both eyes met the primary endpoint. Treatment interval between 2 doses injected into the same eye had to be at least 28 days. FIREFLEYE/FIREFLEYE NEXT EYLEA 0.4 mg Laser EYLEA 0.4 mg Laser Full Analysis Set Included patients who were both randomized and treated from the BUTTERFLEYE and FIREFLEYE/FIREFLEYE NEXT studies.
