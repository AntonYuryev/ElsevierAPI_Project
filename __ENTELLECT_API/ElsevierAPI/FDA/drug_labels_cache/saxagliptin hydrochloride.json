      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis: Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis, as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels and discontinue QTERN if ketoacidosis is suspected. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting. (5.1) \u2022 Pancreatitis: If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue QTERN. (5.2) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider risks and benefits of QTERN in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.3) \u2022 Volume Depletion: Before initiating QTERN, assess volume status and renal function in the elderly, patients with renal impairment or low systolic blood pressure, and in patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating QTERN. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene): Serious, life-threatening cases have occurred in both females and males. Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, institute prompt treatment. (5.7) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Promptly discontinue QTERN, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Genital Mycotic Infections: Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue QTERN if appropriate. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue QTERN. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin, a component of QTERN, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. QTERN is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing QTERN [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.2) ] ; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors. Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue QTERN, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting QTERN. Withhold QTERN, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume QTERN when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.5) ] . Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue QTERN and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of QTERN, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue QTERN and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using QTERN. 5.3 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Subjects with a prior history of heart failure and subjects with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of QTERN prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk of heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of QTERN. 5.4 Volume Depletion Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating QTERN in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, and renal function after initiating therapy. 5.5 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis Serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization have been reported in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2) ] . 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Both dapagliflozin and saxagliptin can individually increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when these agents are used in combination with QTERN [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] . 5.7 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene) Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with QTERN presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue QTERN, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue QTERN, treat per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms are resolved. Assess for other potential causes for the event. Institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin. 5.9 Genital Mycotic Infections Dapagliflozin increases the risks of genital mycotic infections. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] . Monitor and treat appropriately. 5.10 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6) ] . 5.11 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving QTERN. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, QTERN should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of combined use of 10 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin has been evaluated in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a pooled safety analysis of three phase 3 active/placebo-controlled clinical trials with a median exposure of 51 weeks. The pooled safety analysis included a total of 1169 adults: 492 patients in the combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin plus metformin group, 341 patients in the dapagliflozin plus metformin group, 336 patients in the saxagliptin plus metformin group. The mean age of these subjects was 54 years, 0.8% were 75 years or older and 53.7% were female. The population was 80.9% White, 8.3% Black or African American, 3.7% Asian, and 6.6% Other race. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.5 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.4%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 94.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The common adverse reactions were based on the pooled analyses of these studies as shown in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Subjects Treated with 10 mg Dapagliflozin and 5 mg Saxagliptin plus Metformin (\u22651500 mg) Adverse Reaction Preferred Term Adverse reactions that are medically related were grouped to a single preferred term. Frequency % Upper respiratory tract infection 13.6 Urinary tract infection 5.7 Dyslipidemia 5.1 Headache 4.3 Diarrhea 3.7 Back pain 3.3 Genital infection 3.0 Arthralgia 2.4 Additionally, adverse reactions reported in <5% and \u22652% from the dapagliflozin development program and \u22651% more frequently compared to placebo included increased urination and discomfort with urination. Hypoglycemia In the pooled analysis, the incidences of hypoglycemia (defined as a blood glucose <54 mg/dL regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms) and severe hypoglycemia (event requiring assistance due to neuroglycopenia, characterized by altered mental and/or physical status) was 1% and 0.2%, respectively. Genital Mycotic Infections Genital mycotic infections were reported in 15 subjects (3%) treated with QTERN. Reported adverse reactions by frequency included vulvovaginal mycotic infection, balanoposthitis, genital fungal infection, vaginal infection, and vulvovaginitis. The majority of subjects (84.2%) who experienced genital infection adverse reactions were females. Urinary Tract Infections Urinary tract infections were reported in 28 subjects (5.7%) treated with QTERN. Reported adverse reactions by frequency included urinary tract infection, Escherichia urinary tract infection, prostatitis, and pyelonephritis. The majority of subjects (80.6%) who experienced urinary tract infection adverse reactions were females. Volume Depletion Dapagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Events related to volume depletion (hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolemia) were reported in 2 subjects (0.4%) treated with QTERN plus metformin. Impairment of Renal Function Adverse reactions related to decreased renal function were reported in 10 subjects (2.0%) treated with QTERN plus metformin. The reported adverse reactions included decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal impairment, increased blood creatinine, acute renal failure, and decreased urine output. None of the adverse reactions were reported as serious and all but one was mild to moderate in intensity. Three subjects discontinued due to decreased eGFR. Subjects with AEs of renal impairment had lower mean eGFR values at baseline of 64.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 compared to 94.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in overall population treated with QTERN. Ketoacidosis Dapagliflozin In the cardiovascular outcome study with dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported in 27 out of 8574 patients in the dapagliflozin-treated group and in 12 out of 8569 patients in the placebo group. The events were evenly distributed over the study period. Laboratory Tests Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR Dapagliflozin Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin causes a small increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR. These changes in serum creatinine and eGFR generally occur within two weeks of starting therapy and then stabilize regardless of baseline kidney function. Changes that do not fit this pattern should prompt further evaluation to exclude the possibility of acute kidney injury. In two studies that included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment, the acute effect on eGFR reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with dapagliflozin. Decrease in Lymphocyte Counts Saxagliptin A dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count has been observed with saxagliptin. In a pool of 5 placebo-controlled studies, a mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 100 cells/microL relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% in the 2.5 mg, 5 mg saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. Increase in Hematocrit Dapagliflozin In a pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies with dapagliflozin, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in dapagliflozin-treated patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were -0.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the 10 mg dapagliflozin group. By Week 24, hematocrit values >55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of 10 mg dapagliflozin-treated patients. Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Patients treated with QTERN demonstrated a mean percent increase from baseline LDL-cholesterol (ranging from 2.1 to 6.9%). Elevations in Creatine Kinase An imbalance in the number of subjects who experienced serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations >10x the upper limit of normal (a marker of muscle injury/necrosis) was observed in 5 subjects (1%) treated with QTERN. The elevations were transient. Rhabdomyolysis was reported for one of those subjects for which no obvious cause was identified. Decrease in Serum Bicarbonate In a study of concomitant therapy of 10 mg dapagliflozin with exenatide extended-release (on a background of metformin), four patients (1.7%) on concomitant therapy had a serum bicarbonate value of less than or equal to 13 mEq/L compared to one each (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin and exenatide-extended release treatment groups. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. Because the following reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Dapagliflozin Infections: Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene), urosepsis and pyelonephritis Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Ketoacidosis Renal and Urinary Disorders: Acute kidney injury Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash Saxagliptin Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis, severe and disabling arthralgia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Bullous pemphigoid"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3: Clinically Relevant Interactions with QTERN Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes Clinical Impact Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). Intervention Do not coadminister QTERN with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.4 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact The risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when QTERN is used concomitantly with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see WARNINGS AND PRECUATIONS (5.6) ] . Intervention Concomitant use may require lower doses of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Lithium Clinical Impact Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during QTERN initiation and dosage changes. Positive Urine Glucose Test Clinical Impact SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5\u2011anhydroglucitol (1,5\u2011AG) Assay Clinical Impact Measurements of 1,5\u2011AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5\u2011AG assay is not recommended. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. \u2022 Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors (e.g., Ketoconazole): Do not coadminister QTERN with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Advise females of the potential risk to a fetus especially during the second and third trimesters. (8.1) \u2022 Lactation: Not recommended when breastfeeding. (8.2) \u2022 Geriatrics: Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to hypotension. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion. ( 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data showing adverse renal effects from dapagliflozin, QTERN is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The limited available data with QTERN or its components (dapagliflozin and saxagliptin) in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal studies, adverse renal pelvic and tubular dilatations, that were not fully reversible, were observed in rats when dapagliflozin (a component of QTERN) was administered during a period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy, at all doses tested; the lowest of which provided an exposure 15-times the 10 mg clinical dose ( see Data ) . No adverse developmental effects were observed when saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7% and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryofetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Animal Data Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin dosed directly to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 21 until PND 90 at doses of 1, 15, or 75 mg/kg/day, increased kidney weights and increased the incidence of renal pelvic and tubular dilatations at all dose levels. Exposure at the lowest dose was 15-times the 10 mg clinical dose (based on AUC). The renal pelvic and tubular dilatations observed in juvenile animals did not fully reverse within a 1-month recovery period. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, dapagliflozin was administered to maternal rats from gestation Day 6 through lactation Day 21 at doses of 1, 15, or 75 mg/kg/day, and pups were indirectly exposed in utero and throughout lactation. Increased incidence or severity of renal pelvic dilatation was observed in 21 day-old pup offspring of treated dams at 75 mg/kg/day (maternal and pup dapagliflozin exposures were 1415-times and 137-times, respectively, the human values at the 10 mg clinical dose, based on AUC). Dose-related reductions in pup body weights were observed at greater than or equal to 29-times the 10 mg clinical dose (based on AUC). No adverse effects on developmental endpoints were noted at 1 mg/kg/day, (19-times the 10 mg clinical dose, based on AUC). These outcomes occurred with drug exposure during periods of renal development in rats that corresponds to the late second and third trimester of human development. In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits, dapagliflozin was administered throughout organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. In rats, dapagliflozin was neither embryolethal nor teratogenic at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (1441-times the 10 mg clinical dose, based on AUC). Dose-related effects on the rat fetus (structural abnormalities and reduced body weight) occurred only at higher dosages, equal to or greater than 150 mg/kg (more than 2344-times the 10 mg clinical dose, based on AUC), which were associated with maternal toxicity. No developmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at doses up to 180 mg/kg/day (1191-times the 10 mg clinical dose, based on AUC). Saxagliptin In embryofetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of QTERN or its components (dapagliflozin and saxagliptin) in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin are present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) . However, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data is not clear. Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, advise women that use of QTERN is not recommended while breastfeeding. Data Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin was present at a milk/plasma ratio of 0.49, indicating that dapagliflozin and its metabolites are transferred into milk at a concentration that is approximately 50% of that in maternal plasma. Juvenile rats directly exposed to dapagliflozin showed a risk to the developing kidney (renal pelvic and tubular dilatations) during maturation. Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of QTERN in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken when using QTERN in the elderly based on renal function [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) ] . Dapagliflozin A total of 1424 (24%) of the 5936 dapagliflozin-treated patients were 65 years and older and 207 (3.5%) patients were 75 years and older in a pool of 21 double-blind, controlled, clinical studies assessing the efficacy of dapagliflozin in improving glycemic control. After controlling for level of renal function (eGFR), in clinical studies with dapagliflozin, efficacy was similar for patients under age 65 years and those 65 years and older. In patients 65 years and older, a higher proportion of patients treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions of hypotension [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ] . Saxagliptin In the seven double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11,301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects \u226565 years old and younger subjects. While this clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment QTERN is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), ESRD, or on dialysis [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) , CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) ]. Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin was evaluated in two glycemic control studies that included patients with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using dapagliflozin for glycemic control may be more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the study of patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment QTERN may be used in patients with hepatic impairment. However, the benefit-risk for the use of QTERN in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be individually assessed since safety and efficacy have not been studied in this population [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Dapagliflozin Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion. Saxagliptin Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Dapagliflozin Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin dose of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dose of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] . After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days from discontinuation for the 10 mg dose. Figure 1: Scatter Plot and Fitted Line of Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Urinary Glucose Amount versus Dapagliflozin Dose in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Semi-Log Plot) Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15-times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50-times the recommended maximum daily dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. Saxagliptin In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator study using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the recommended maximum daily dose). Figure 1 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Overall, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin were not affected in a clinically relevant manner when administered as QTERN. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption Dapagliflozin Following oral administration of dapagliflozin, the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) is usually attained within 2 hours under fasting state. The C max and AUC values increase dose proportionally with increase in dapagliflozin dose in the therapeutic dose range. The absolute oral bioavailability of dapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Administration of dapagliflozin with a high-fat meal decreases its C max by up to 50% and prolongs T max by approximately 1 hour but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Distribution Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding is not altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metabolism Dapagliflozin The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily mediated by UGT1A9; CYP-mediated metabolism is a minor clearance pathway in humans. Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolized, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is an inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide accounted for 61% of a 50 mg [ 14 C]-dapagliflozin dose and is the predominant drug-related component in human plasma. Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7) ] . Elimination Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily eliminated via the renal pathway. Following a single 50 mg dose of [ 14 C]-dapagliflozin, 75% and 21% total radioactivity is excreted in urine and feces, respectively. In urine, less than 2% of the dose is excreted as parent drug. In feces, approximately 15% of the dose is excreted as parent drug. The mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for dapagliflozin is approximately 12.9 hours following a single oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg. Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of [ 14 C]-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Effects of Age, Gender, Race and Body Weight on Pharmacokinetics Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, gender, race, and body weight do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. Renal Impairment Dapagliflozin At steady state (20 mg once daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (as determined by eGFR) had geometric mean systemic exposures of dapagliflozin that were 45%, 100%, and 200% higher, respectively, as compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with normal renal function. Higher systemic exposure of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal impairment did not result in a correspondingly higher 24-hour urinary glucose excretion. The steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment was 42%, 80%, and 90% lower, respectively, than in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with normal renal function. The impact of hemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) , WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ] . Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2-fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Hepatic Impairment Dapagliflozin In subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean C max and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, as compared to healthy matched control subjects following single-dose administration of 10 mg dapagliflozin. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), mean C max and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 40% and 67% higher, respectively, as compared to healthy matched controls [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ] . Saxagliptin In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics of QTERN in the pediatric population has not been studied. Drug Interactions Saxagliptin and Dapagliflozin The lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin and saxagliptin was demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study between dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. Dapagliflozin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9). In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide neither inhibited CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor induced CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P\u2011gp) active transporter, and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P\u2011gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P\u2011gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates.

Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P\u2011gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P\u2011gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Dapagliflozin Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, dapagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and thereby promotes urinary glucose excretion. Saxagliptin Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Dapagliflozin Increases in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following the administration of dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin dose of 5 or 10 mg per day in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 12 weeks resulted in excretion of approximately 70 grams of glucose in the urine per day at Week 12. A near maximum glucose excretion was observed at the dapagliflozin daily dose of 20 mg. This urinary glucose excretion with dapagliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) ] . After discontinuation of dapagliflozin, on average, the elevation in urinary glucose excretion approaches baseline by about 3 days from discontinuation for the 10 mg dose. Figure 1: Scatter Plot and Fitted Line of Change from Baseline in 24-Hour Urinary Glucose Amount versus Dapagliflozin Dose in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Semi-Log Plot) Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of QTc interval at daily doses up to 150 mg (15-times the recommended maximum dose) in a study of healthy subjects. In addition, no clinically meaningful effect on QTc interval was observed following single doses of up to 500 mg (50-times the recommended maximum daily dose) of dapagliflozin in healthy subjects. Saxagliptin In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator study using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the recommended maximum daily dose).

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Overall, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin were not affected in a clinically relevant manner when administered as QTERN. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin, were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption Dapagliflozin Following oral administration of dapagliflozin, the maximum plasma concentration (C max ) is usually attained within 2 hours under fasting state. The C max and AUC values increase dose proportionally with increase in dapagliflozin dose in the therapeutic dose range. The absolute oral bioavailability of dapagliflozin following the administration of a 10 mg dose is 78%. Administration of dapagliflozin with a high-fat meal decreases its C max by up to 50% and prolongs T max by approximately 1 hour but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Distribution Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding is not altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metabolism Dapagliflozin The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily mediated by UGT1A9; CYP-mediated metabolism is a minor clearance pathway in humans. Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolized, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is an inactive metabolite. Dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide accounted for 61% of a 50 mg [ 14 C]-dapagliflozin dose and is the predominant drug-related component in human plasma. Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7) ] . Elimination Dapagliflozin Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily eliminated via the renal pathway. Following a single 50 mg dose of [ 14 C]-dapagliflozin, 75% and 21% total radioactivity is excreted in urine and feces, respectively. In urine, less than 2% of the dose is excreted as parent drug. In feces, approximately 15% of the dose is excreted as parent drug. The mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for dapagliflozin is approximately 12.9 hours following a single oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg. Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of [ 14 C]-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Effects of Age, Gender, Race and Body Weight on Pharmacokinetics Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, gender, race, and body weight do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin. Renal Impairment Dapagliflozin At steady state (20 mg once daily dapagliflozin for 7 days), patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (as determined by eGFR) had geometric mean systemic exposures of dapagliflozin that were 45%, 100%, and 200% higher, respectively, as compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with normal renal function. Higher systemic exposure of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with renal impairment did not result in a correspondingly higher 24-hour urinary glucose excretion. The steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment was 42%, 80%, and 90% lower, respectively, than in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with normal renal function. The impact of hemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3) , WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ] . Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2-fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Hepatic Impairment Dapagliflozin In subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean C max and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, as compared to healthy matched control subjects following single-dose administration of 10 mg dapagliflozin. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), mean C max and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 40% and 67% higher, respectively, as compared to healthy matched controls [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.7) ] . Saxagliptin In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Pediatric Pharmacokinetics of QTERN in the pediatric population has not been studied. Drug Interactions Saxagliptin and Dapagliflozin The lack of pharmacokinetic interaction between dapagliflozin and saxagliptin was demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study between dapagliflozin and saxagliptin. Dapagliflozin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of dapagliflozin is primarily via glucuronide conjugation mediated by UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9). In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide neither inhibited CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor induced CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P\u2011gp) active transporter, and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P\u2011gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P\u2011gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates.

Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P\u2011gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P\u2011gp.

The following data are based on the findings in the studies with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin individually. Dapagliflozin Carcinogenesis Dapagliflozin did not induce tumors in either mice or rats at any of the doses evaluated in 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Oral doses in mice consisted of 5, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day in males and 2, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day in females, and oral doses in rats were 0.5, 2, and 10 mg/kg/day for both males and females. The highest doses evaluated in mice were approximately 72-times (males) and 105-times (females) the clinical dose of 10 mg per day, based on AUC exposure. In rats, the highest dose was approximately 131-times (males) and 186-times (females) the clinical dose of 10 mg per day, based on AUC exposure. Mutagenesis Dapagliflozin was negative in the Ames mutagenicity assay and was positive in a series of in vitro clastogenicity assays in the presence of S9 activation and at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 \u00b5g/mL. Dapagliflozin was negative for clastogenicity in a series of in vivo studies evaluating micronuclei or DNA repair in rats at exposure multiples greater than 2100-times the clinical dose. Impairment of Fertility Dapagliflozin had no effects on mating, fertility, or early embryonic development in treated male or female rats at exposure multiples less than or equal to 1708-times and 998-times the maximum recommended human dose in males and females, respectively. Saxagliptin Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity was evaluated in 2-year studies conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice dosed orally at 50, 250, and 600 mg/kg up to 870-times (males) and 1165-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in rats dosed orally at 25, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg up to 355-times (males) and 2217-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Mutagenesis Saxagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity tests (Ames bacterial mutagenesis, human and rat lymphocyte cytogenetics, rat bone marrow micronucleus and DNA repair assays). The active metabolite of saxagliptin was not mutagenic in an Ames bacterial assay. Impairment of Fertility Saxagliptin administered to rats had no effect on fertility or the ability to maintain a litter at exposures up to 603-times and 776-times the 5 mg clinical dose in males and females, based on AUC. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Saxagliptin Saxagliptin produced adverse skin changes in the extremities of cynomolgus monkeys (scabs and/or ulceration of tail, digits, scrotum, and/or nose). Skin lesions were reversible within exposure approximately 20-times the 5 mg clinical dose, but in some cases were irreversible and necrotizing at higher exposures. Adverse skin changes were not observed at exposures similar to (1- to 3-times) the 5 mg clinical dose. Clinical correlates to skin lesions in monkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The dapagliflozin and saxagliptin in combination with metformin has been studied in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on metformin in the following studies. Treatment with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin and metformin (combination or add-on therapy) at all doses produced statistically significant improvements in HbA1c compared to the active comparator or placebo study arms in combination with metformin. 14.1 Add-on Therapy with Dapagliflozin plus Saxagliptin in Patients on Metformin Adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in 2 active-controlled studies of 24-week duration to evaluate therapy with 5 mg dapagliflozin/5 mg saxagliptin or 10 mg dapagliflozin/5 mg saxagliptin combinations on a background of metformin. One study was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study (NCT02681094) in T2DM patients with an HbA1c \u22657.5% and \u226410.0%. Patients were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to being randomized to one of three double-blind treatment groups to receive 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin added to metformin, 5 mg saxagliptin and placebo added to metformin, or 5 mg dapagliflozin and placebo added to metformin. At Week 24, concomitant addition of 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin resulted in statistically significant decreases in HbA1c, and a larger proportion of patients achieving the therapeutic glycemic goal of HbA1c <7%, compared to dapagliflozin plus metformin or saxagliptin plus metformin (see Table 8). Table 8: HbA1c Results at Week 24 with the Combination of 5 mg Dapagliflozin and 5 mg Saxagliptin plus Metformin Analysis of Covariance including all post-baseline data regardless of rescue or treatment discontinuation. Model estimates calculated using multiple imputation to model washout of the treatment effect using control arm data for all subjects having missing Week 24 data.

The adjusted mean change from baseline for body weight at Week 24, using values regardless of rescue or treatment discontinuation, was -2.0 kg for the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin group, -2.1 kg for the 5 mg dapagliflozin plus metformin group, and -0.4 kg for the 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin group. The difference in mean body weight between the 5 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin group and the 5 mg dapagliflozin plus metformin group was -1.6 kg (95% CI [-2.1, -1.0]). The second study was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled superiority study (NCT016060007) that compared once daily 10 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin coadministered in combination with metformin XR with either 10 mg dapagliflozin and placebo added to metformin or 5 mg saxagliptin and placebo added to metformin in T2DM adult patients with inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone (HbA1c \u22658% and \u226412%). At Week 24, concomitant addition of 10 mg dapagliflozin and 5 mg saxagliptin plus metformin resulted in statistically significant decreases in HbA1c, and a larger proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c <7%, compared to dapagliflozin plus metformin or saxagliptin plus metformin (see Table 9).

The mean age of these subjects was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% Other race. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin (\u22651500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible subjects who completed the screening period entered the lead-in treatment period, which included 16 weeks of open-label metformin and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg saxagliptin (N=153) or placebo (N=162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 10). Table 10: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-on to Dapagliflozin and Metformin There were 6.5% (n=10) of randomized subjects in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n=5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at Week 24. Of the subjects who discontinued study medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at Week 24. Efficacy parameter 5 mg Saxagliptin (N=153) N is the number of randomized and treated patients.

(\u22120.5, \u22120.2) Percent of patients achieving HbA1c <7% 35.3 23.1 14.3 Cardiovascular Safety Trial The cardiovascular risk of saxagliptin was evaluated in SAVOR (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction), a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing saxagliptin (N=8280) to placebo (N=8212), in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Of the randomized study subjects, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years (NCT01107886). Subjects were at least 40 years of age, had HbA1c \u22656.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized subjects) for cardiovascular disease (age \u226555 years for men and \u226560 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized subjects) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The majority of subjects were male (67%) and Caucasian (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (eGFR \u226530 to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) to severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. QTERN is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Subjects had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years and a mean baseline HbA1c level of 8.0%. The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on saxagliptin with an estimated HR: 1.0; 95.1% CI: (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3. Vital status was obtained for 99% of subjects in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all-cause mortality was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27)."

      "MEDICATION GUIDE QTERN \u00ae [CUE-turn] (dapagliflozin and saxagliptin) tablets, for oral use What is the most important information I should know about QTERN? Serious side effects can happen to people taking QTERN, including: \u2022 \u2022 Diabetic Ketoacidosis (increased ketones in your blood or urine) in people with type 1 diabetes and other ketoacidosis. QTERN can cause ketoacidosis that can be life-threatening and may lead to death. Ketoacidosis is a serious condition which needs to be treated in a hospital. People with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of getting ketoacidosis. People with type 2 diabetes or pancreas problems also have an increased risk of getting ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis can also happen in people who are sick, cannot eat or drink as usual, skip meals, are on a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates (ketogenic diet), take less than the usual amount of insulin or miss insulin doses, drink too much alcohol, have a loss of too much fluid from the body (volume depletion), or who have surgery. Ketoacidosis can happen even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. Your healthcare provider may ask you to periodically check ketones in your urine or blood. Stop taking QTERN and call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you get any of the following. If possible, check for ketones in your urine or blood, even if your blood sugar is less than 250 mg/dL. \u2218 nausea \u2218 vomiting \u2218 stomach area (abdominal) pain \u2218 tiredness \u2218 trouble breathing \u2218 ketones in your urine or blood \u2022 Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Saxagliptin, one of the medicines in QTERN, can cause inflammation of the pancreas, which may be severe and lead to death. Certain medical problems make you more likely to get pancreatitis. Before you start taking QTERN, tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had: \u2218 inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis) \u2218 stones in your gallbladder (gallstones) \u2218 a history of alcoholism \u2218 high blood triglyceride levels It is not known if having these medical problems will make you more likely to get pancreatitis with QTERN. Stop taking QTERN and contact your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in your stomach area (abdomen) that is severe and will not go away. The pain may be felt going from your abdomen through to your back. The pain may happen with or without vomiting. These may be symptoms of pancreatitis. \u2022 Heart failure. Heart failure means your heart does not pump blood well enough. Before you start taking QTERN, tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had heart failure or have problems with your kidneys. Contact your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms: \u2218 increasing shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially when you lie down \u2218 swelling or fluid retention, especially in the feet, ankles, or legs \u2218 an unusually fast increase in weight \u2218 unusual tiredness These may be symptoms of heart failure. \u2022 Dehydration. QTERN can cause some people to become dehydrated (the loss of body water and salt). Dehydration may cause you to feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or weak, especially when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). There have been reports of sudden kidney injury in people with Type 2 diabetes who are taking dapagliflozin, a component of QTERN. You may be at a higher risk of dehydration if you: \u2218 take medicines to lower your blood pressure, including water pills (diuretics) \u2218 are on a low salt diet \u2218 have kidney problems \u2218 are 65 years of age or older Talk to your healthcare provider about what you can do to prevent dehydration including how much fluid you should drink on a daily basis.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease): Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg once daily regardless of meals. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Assess renal function before starting saxagliptin tablets and periodically thereafter. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Limit the dosage of saxagliptin tablets to 2.5 mg daily for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. Do not cut, crush, or chew saxagliptin tablets. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of saxagliptin tablets and then as clinically indicated [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. The recommended dosage of saxagliptin tablets in patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. The dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg orally once daily for patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [which includes a subset of moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis] [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Saxagliptin tablets should be administered following hemodialysis. Saxagliptin tablets have not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg orally once daily when used concomitantly with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin tablets. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin tablets in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination with saxagliptin tablets. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity-Related Events: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue saxagliptin tablets, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Arthralgia : Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin tablets. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin tablets. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin tablets compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Preexisting risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin tablets and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of saxagliptin tablets, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin tablets and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using saxagliptin tablets. 5.2 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin tablets (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin tablets group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of saxagliptin tablets. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When saxagliptin tablets were used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with saxagliptin tablets [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin tablets. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin tablets, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin tablets, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin tablets. 5.5 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.6 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin tablets. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, saxagliptin tablets should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Heart Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Severe and disabling arthralgia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Bullous pemphigoid [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5% and more often than placebo) are upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Peripheral edema was reported more commonly in patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin tablets and a thiazolidinedione (TZD) than in patients treated with the combination of placebo and TZD. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin tablets and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin tablets of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years of age or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, the population had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin tablets. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin tablets than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin tablets. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin hydrochloride (HCl), thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin Tablets 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients Saxagliptin Tablets 5 mg N = 882 Placebo N = 799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u2265 5% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin tablets 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and saxagliptin tablets 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin tablets (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin tablets did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin tablets on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin tablets is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg, saxagliptin tablets 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions, was similar between saxagliptin tablets and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. In the add-on to glyburide trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher for saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and saxagliptin tablets 5 mg (13.3% and 14.6%) versus placebo (10.1%). The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia in this trial, defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of \u2264 50 mg/dL, was 2.4% and 0.8% for saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and saxagliptin tablets 5 mg and 0.7% for placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and saxagliptin tablets 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively, 7.8% and 5.8% versus 5% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 4.1% and 2.7% versus 3.8% given as add-on therapy to TZD. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given saxagliptin tablets 5 mg plus metformin HCl and 4% in patients given metformin HCl alone. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin tablet-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p < 0.0001). In the add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin tablets 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). In the add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin tablets 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin tablet-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg, saxagliptin tablets 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin tablets required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin tablet-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine > 6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin tablet-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin tablets versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for saxagliptin tablet-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin tablets (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from > 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u2264 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin tablets to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin tablet-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin tablets until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin tablets that remained stable throughout saxagliptin tablet treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin tablet use. Causality has not been estimated and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin tablet use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in a saxagliptin tablet-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin tablet therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin tablet use. Vital Signs No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin tablets. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin tablets. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with saxagliptin tablets in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriages. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis and in pregnant and lactating rats during the pre- and postnatal period [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, still birth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of saxagliptin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Saxagliptin is present in the milk of lactating rats [ see Data ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for saxagliptin tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from saxagliptin tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of saxagliptin tablets as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness of saxagliptin tablets was not demonstrated in a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 26-week safety extension (NCT03199053) in 164 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin tablets, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11301 patients randomized to saxagliptin tablets were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Saxagliptin and its active metabolite are eliminated in part by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection in the elderly based on renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg were administered orally to 85 patients with moderate (n = 48) or severe (n = 18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n = 19) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin tablets and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four saxagliptin tablet-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin tablets inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin tablets were not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Saxagliptin tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~ 230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~ 120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin tablets 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were > 2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin tablets inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin tablets were not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Saxagliptin tablets may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~ 230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~ 120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin tablets 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were > 2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

The active metabolite of saxagliptin was not mutagenic in an Ames bacterial assay. Impairment of Fertility Saxagliptin administered to rats had no effect on fertility or the ability to maintain a litter at exposures up to 603-times and 776-times the 5 mg clinical dose in males and females, based on AUC. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Saxagliptin produced adverse skin changes in the extremities of cynomolgus monkeys (scabs and/or ulceration of tail, digits, scrotum, and/or nose). Skin lesions were reversible within exposure approximately 20-times the 5 mg clinical dose, but in some cases were irreversible and necrotizing at higher exposures. Adverse skin changes were not observed at exposures similar to (1- to 3-times) the 5 mg clinical dose. Clinical correlates to skin lesions in monkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Saxagliptin tablets have been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin HCl, glyburide, and thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) therapy. A total of 4148 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized in six, double-blind, controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the safety and glycemic efficacy of saxagliptin tablets administered orally. A total of 3021 patients in these trials were treated with saxagliptin tablets. In these trials, the mean age was 54 years, and 71% of patients were White, 16% were Asian, 4% were Black or African American, and 9% were of other racial groups. An additional 423 patients, including 315 who received saxagliptin tablets, participated in a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of 6 to 12 weeks in duration. In these six, double-blind trials, saxagliptin tablets were evaluated at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg once daily. Three of these trials also evaluated a saxagliptin tablet dose of 10 mg daily. The 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin tablets did not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Treatment with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg and 2.5 mg doses produced statistically significant improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in A1C were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. Saxagliptin tablets were not associated with significant changes from baseline in body weight or fasting serum lipids compared to placebo. Saxagliptin tablets have also been evaluated in five additional trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin tablets to glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, a trial comparing saxagliptin tablets to placebo in 455 patients inadequately controlled on insulin alone or on insulin in combination with metformin HCl, a trial comparing saxagliptin tablets to placebo in 257 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea, a trial comparing saxagliptin tablets to placebo in 315 patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl, and a trial comparing saxagliptin tablets to placebo in 170 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD. Monotherapy A total of 766 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on diet and exercise (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10%) participated in two 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin tablet monotherapy. In the first trial, following a 2-week single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period, 401 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin tablets or placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy, added on to placebo or saxagliptin tablets. Efficacy was evaluated at the last measurement prior to rescue therapy for patients needing rescue. Dose titration of saxagliptin tablets was not permitted. Treatment with saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and 5 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 16% in the saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg treatment group, 20% in the saxagliptin tablets 5 mg treatment group, and 26% in the placebo group. Table 4: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablet Monotherapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to metformin HCl rescue therapy for patients needing rescue Efficacy Parameter Saxagliptin Tablets 2.5 mg N = 102 Saxagliptin Tablets 5 mg N = 106 Placebo N = 95 Hemoglobin A1C (%) N = 100 N = 103 N = 92 Baseline (mean) 7.9 8.0 7.9 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares mean adjusted for baseline value. ) -0.4 -0.5 +0.2 Difference from placebo (adjusted mean ) -0.6 p-value < 0.0001 compared to placebo. -0.6 95% Confidence Interval (-0.9, -0.3) (-0.9, -0.4) Percent of patients achieving A1C < 7% 35% (35/100) 38% p-value < 0.05 compared to placebo.

Treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10%) underwent a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period. A total of 365 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of saxagliptin tablets, or placebo. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy added on to placebo or saxagliptin tablets; the number of patients randomized per treatment group ranged from 71 to 74. Treatment with either saxagliptin tablets 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of -0.4% and -0.3%, respectively). Treatment with saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg every morning also provided significant improvement in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reduction of -0.4%). Combination Therapy Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl A total of 743 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin tablets in combination with metformin HCl in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% and \u2264 10%) on metformin HCl alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1,500-2,550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl at their pre-trial dose, up to 2,500 mg daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin tablets or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. The 10 mg dosage of saxagliptin tablets is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of saxagliptin tablets and metformin HCl were not permitted. Saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin HCl (Table 5). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg add-on to metformin HCl group, 13% in the saxagliptin tablets 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin HCl group.

Mean change from baseline is adjusted for baseline value. Figure 1: Mean Change from Baseline in A1C in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets as Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl Add-On Combination Therapy with a Thiazolidinedione A total of 565 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin tablets in combination with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10.5%) on TZD alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of pioglitazone (30-45 mg once daily) or rosiglitazone (4 mg once daily or 8 mg either once daily or in two divided doses of 4 mg) for at least 12 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received TZD at their pre-trial dose. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg of saxagliptin tablets or placebo in addition to their current dose of TZD. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titration of saxagliptin tablets or TZD was not permitted during the trial. A change in TZD regimen from rosiglitazone to pioglitazone at specified, equivalent therapeutic doses was permitted at the investigator\u2019s discretion if believed to be medically appropriate. Saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to TZD provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to TZD (Table 6). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 10% in the saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg add-on to TZD group, 6% for the saxagliptin tablets 5 mg add-on to TZD group, and 10% in the placebo add-on to TZD group.

To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a submaximal dose of SU for 2 months or greater. In this trial, saxagliptin tablets in combination with a fixed, intermediate dose of SU was compared to titration to a higher dose of SU. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 4-week, dietary and exercise lead-in period, and placed on glyburide 7.5 mg once daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients with A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10% were randomized to either 2.5 mg or 5 mg of saxagliptin tablets add-on to 7.5 mg glyburide or to placebo plus a 10 mg total daily dose of glyburide. Patients who received placebo were eligible to have glyburide up-titrated to a total daily dose of 15 mg. Up-titration of glyburide was not permitted in patients who received saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg or 5 mg. Glyburide could be down-titrated in any treatment group once during the 24-week trial period due to hypoglycemia as deemed necessary by the investigator. Approximately 92% of patients in the placebo plus glyburide group were up-titrated to a final total daily dose of 15 mg during the first 4 weeks of the trial period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medication. Dose titration of saxagliptin tablets was not permitted during the trial. In combination with glyburide, saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and 5 mg provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group (Table 7). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 18% in the saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg add-on to glyburide group, 17% in the saxagliptin tablets 5 mg add-on to glyburide group, and 30% in the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group. Table 7: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets as Add-On Combination Therapy with Glyburide Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to metformin HCl rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: saxagliptin tablets 5 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl 500 mg + placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. Saxagliptin tablets were dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2,000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trials were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of saxagliptin tablets 5 mg plus metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin HCl (Table 8). Table 8: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablet Coadministration with Metformin HCl in Treatment-Naive Patients Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (at least 1,500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl (1,500-3,000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of saxagliptin tablets or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264 110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin tablets and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C < 9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin tablets compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p < 0.0001). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters at Week 52 in an Active-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets versus Glipizide in Combination with Metformin HCl Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial. Efficacy Parameter Saxagliptin Tablets 5 mg + Metformin HCl N = 428 Titrated Glipizide + Metformin HCl N = 430 Hemoglobin A1C (%) N = 423 N = 423 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares mean adjusted for baseline value. ) -0.6 -0.7 Difference from glipizide + metformin HCl (adjusted mean ) 0.1 95% Confidence Interval (-0.02, 0.2) Saxagliptin tablets + metformin HCl is considered non-inferior to glipizide + metformin HCl because the upper limit of this confidence interval is less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.35%. Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dL) N = 420 N = 420 Baseline (mean) 162 161 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -9 -16 Difference from glipizide + metformin HCl (adjusted mean ) 6 95% Confidence Interval (2, 11) Significance not tested. Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without metformin HCl) A total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin tablets in combination with insulin in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7.5% and \u2264 11%) on insulin alone (N = 141) or on insulin in combination with a stable dose of metformin HCl (N = 314). Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u2265 30 units to \u2264 150 units daily) with \u2264 20% variation in total daily dose for \u2265 8 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin HCl if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either saxagliptin tablets 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by > 20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using saxagliptin tablets 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and saxagliptin tablets 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin HCl (-0.4% and -0.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the saxagliptin tablets group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with saxagliptin tablets 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the saxagliptin tablets 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets as Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to insulin rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 17% (52/300) with saxagliptin tablets in combination with insulin compared to 7% (10/149) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin tablets in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% and \u2264 10%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1,500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u2265 50% of the maximum recommended dose) for \u2265 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind saxagliptin tablets (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. Saxagliptin tablets in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin tablets group and 5% in the placebo group. Table 11: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets as Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea Intent-to-treat population using last observation prior to discontinuation.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin tablets in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin tablets added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u2265 7% to \u2264 10.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline the population had diabetes mellitus for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u2265 1,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead in treatment period, which included open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to saxagliptin tablets 5 mg (N = 153) or placebo (N = 162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin tablets had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets as Add-on to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl There were 6.5% (n = 10) of randomized patients in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n = 5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at week 24. Of the patients who discontinued trial medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at week 24.

In this trial, 98% of the patients were using background antidiabetic medications (75% were using insulin and 31% were using oral antidiabetic medications, mostly sulfonylureas). After 12 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg provided significant improvement in A1C compared to placebo (Table 13). In the subgroup of patients with ESRD, saxagliptin tablets and placebo resulted in comparable reductions in A1C from baseline to Week 12. This finding is inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment. After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean change in FPG was -12 mg/dL with saxagliptin tablets 2.5 mg and -13 mg/dL with placebo. Compared to placebo, the mean change in FPG with saxagliptin tablets was -12 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with moderate renal impairment, -4 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with severe renal impairment, and +44 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with ESRD. These findings are inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment. Table 13: A1C at Week 12 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Tablets in Patients with Renal Impairment Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial.

Of the randomized trial patients, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years. The trial was event-driven, and patients were followed until a sufficient number of events were accrued. Patients were at least 40 years of age, had A1C \u2265 6.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized patients) for cardiovascular disease (age \u2265 55 years for men and \u2265 60 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized patients) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%]. The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u2265 30 to \u2264 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) to severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. Patients had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years, and a mean baseline A1C level of 8.0%. Approximately 5% of patients were treated with diet and exercise only at baseline. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (ACE inhibitors or ARBs 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and was also powered for a superiority comparison if non-inferiority was demonstrated. The results of SAVOR, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 14. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on saxagliptin tablets. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with saxagliptin tablets relative to placebo was 1.00 with a 95.1% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.

The curves for both saxagliptin tablets and placebo arms are close together throughout the duration of the trial. The estimated cumulative event probability is approximately linear for both arms, indicating that the incidence of MACE for both arms was constant over the trial duration. Figure 2: Cumulative Percent of Time to First MACE Vital status was obtained for 99% of patients in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the saxagliptin tablets group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all cause (Table 15) was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. (2.1) \u2022 Patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease): Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg once daily regardless of meals. (2.2) \u2022 Assess renal function before starting ONGLYZA and periodically thereafter. (2.2) \u2022 Limit the dosage of ONGLYZA to 2.5 mg daily for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). (2.3) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. Do not cut, crush, or chew ONGLYZA tablets. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of ONGLYZA and then as clinically indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. The recommended dosage of ONGLYZA in patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. The dosage of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg orally once daily for patients with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [which includes a subset of moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis] [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. ONGLYZA should be administered following hemodialysis. ONGLYZA has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The dosage of ONGLYZA is 2.5 mg orally once daily when used concomitantly with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue ONGLYZA. (5.1) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of ONGLYZA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. (5.2) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination wtih ONGLYZA. (5.3) \u2022 Hypersensitivity-Related Events There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue ONGLYZA, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. (5.4) \u2022 Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (5.5) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue ONGLYZA. (5.6) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking ONGLYZA. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving ONGLYZA compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Preexisting risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving ONGLYZA and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of ONGLYZA, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue ONGLYZA and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using ONGLYZA. 5.2 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to ONGLYZA (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the ONGLYZA group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of ONGLYZA prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of ONGLYZA. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When ONGLYZA was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with ONGLYZA [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with ONGLYZA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with ONGLYZA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue ONGLYZA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with ONGLYZA. 5.5 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.6 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP\u20114 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving ONGLYZA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, ONGLYZA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Heart Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Severe and disabling arthralgia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Bullous pemphigoid [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% and more often than placebo) are upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache. (6.1) \u2022 Peripheral edema was reported more commonly in patients treated with the combination of ONGLYZA and a thiazolidinedione (TZD) than in patients treated with the combination of placebo and TZD. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to ONGLYZA and a mean duration of exposure to ONGLYZA of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4 % were 75 years of age or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR\u226560 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of ONGLYZA. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on ONGLYZA than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with ONGLYZA. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin hydrochloride (HCl), thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients ONGLYZA 5 mg N=882 Placebo N=799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u22655% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for ONGLYZA (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received ONGLYZA did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of ONGLYZA on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to ONGLYZA is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, ONGLYZA 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions, was similar between ONGLYZA and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. In the add-on to glyburide trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg (13.3% and 14.6%) versus placebo (10.1%). The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia in this trial, defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of \u226450 mg/dL, was 2.4% and 0.8% for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg and 0.7% for placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and ONGLYZA 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively, 7.8% and 5.8% versus 5% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 4.1% and 2.7% versus 3.8% given as add-on therapy to TZD. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given ONGLYZA 5 mg plus metformin HCl and 4% in patients given metformin HCl alone. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with ONGLYZA 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with ONGLYZA 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was reported in none of the ONGLYZA-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001). In the add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for ONGLYZA 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was higher with ONGLYZA 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). In the add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for ONGLYZA 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the ONGLYZA-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, ONGLYZA 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received ONGLYZA required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One ONGLYZA-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine >6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of ONGLYZA-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the ONGLYZA versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for ONGLYZA-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to ONGLYZA (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from >50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for ONGLYZA to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 ONGLYZA-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with ONGLYZA until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of ONGLYZA that remained stable throughout ONGLYZA treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with ONGLYZA use. Causality has not been estimated and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to ONGLYZA use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in an ONGLYZA-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of ONGLYZA therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with ONGLYZA use. Vital Signs No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with ONGLYZA. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with ONGLYZA. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with ONGLYZA 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when ONGLYZA 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin HCl compared to metformin HCl alone. There was no difference observed for ONGLYZA 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to ONGLYZA although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of ONGLYZA. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with ONGLYZA relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on ONGLYZA and placebo, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of ONGLYZA on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ONGLYZA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis \u2022 Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \u2022 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis, Severe and disabling arthralgia \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Bullous pemphigoid"

(7.1) 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). The dosage of ONGLYZA should be limited to 2.5 mg when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with ONGLYZA in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriages. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis and in pregnant and lactating rats during the pre- and postnatal period [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, still birth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of ONGLYZA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Saxagliptin is present in the milk of lactating rats [ see Data ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ONGLYZA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ONGLYZA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ONGLYZA as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness of ONGLYZA was not demonstrated in a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 26-week safety extension (NCT03199053) in 164 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of ONGLYZA, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11301 patients randomized to ONGLYZA were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Saxagliptin and its active metabolite are eliminated in part by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection in the elderly based on renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, ONGLYZA 2.5 mg was administered orally to 85 patients with moderate (n=48) or severe (n=18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n=19) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between ONGLYZA and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four ONGLYZA-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose \u226450 mg/dL).",
      "Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of ONGLYZA inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, ONGLYZA was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. ONGLYZA may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of ONGLYZA 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years).

The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, ONGLYZA was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. ONGLYZA may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of ONGLYZA 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ONGLYZA has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin HCl, glyburide, and thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) therapy. A total of 4148 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized in six, double-blind, controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the safety and glycemic efficacy of ONGLYZA administered orally. A total of 3021 patients in these trials were treated with ONGLYZA. In these trials, the mean age was 54 years, and 71% of patients were White, 16% were Asian, 4% were Black or African American, and 9% were of other racial groups. An additional 423 patients, including 315 who received ONGLYZA, participated in a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of 6 to 12 weeks in duration. In these six, double-blind trials, ONGLYZA was evaluated at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg once daily. Three of these trials also evaluated an ONGLYZA dose of 10 mg daily. The 10 mg daily dose of ONGLYZA did not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Treatment with ONGLYZA 5 mg and 2.5 mg doses produced statistically significant improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in A1C were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. ONGLYZA was not associated with significant changes from baseline in body weight or fasting serum lipids compared to placebo. ONGLYZA has also been evaluated in five additional trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with ONGLYZA to glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, a trial comparing ONGLYZA to placebo in 455 patients inadequately controlled on insulin alone or on insulin in combination with metformin HCl, a trial comparing ONGLYZA to placebo in 257 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea, a trial comparing ONGLYZA to placebo in 315 patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl, and a trial comparing ONGLYZA to placebo in 170 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD. Monotherapy A total of 766 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on diet and exercise (A1C \u22657% to \u226410%) participated in two 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ONGLYZA monotherapy. In the first trial, following a 2-week single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period, 401 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of ONGLYZA or placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy, added on to placebo or ONGLYZA. Efficacy was evaluated at the last measurement prior to rescue therapy for patients needing rescue. Dose titration of ONGLYZA was not permitted. Treatment with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 5 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 16% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg treatment group, 20% in the ONGLYZA 5 mg treatment group, and 26% in the placebo group. Table 4: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled trial of ONGLYZA Monotherapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to metformin HCl rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

Treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1C \u22657% to \u226410%) underwent a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period. A total of 365 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of ONGLYZA, or placebo. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy added on to placebo or ONGLYZA; the number of patients randomized per treatment group ranged from 71 to 74. Treatment with either ONGLYZA 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of \u22120.4% and \u22120.3%, respectively). Treatment with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg every morning also provided significant improvement in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reduction of \u22120.4%). Combination Therapy Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl A total of 743 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONGLYZA in combination with metformin HCl in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%) on metformin alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1,500-2,550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl at their pre-trial dose, up to 2,500 mg daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of ONGLYZA or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. The 10 mg dosage of ONGLYZA is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of ONGLYZA and metformin HCl were not permitted. ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin (Table 5). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg add-on to metformin group, 13% in the ONGLYZA 5 mg add-on to metformin group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin group.

Week 24 (LOCF) includes intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy for patients needing rescue. Mean change from baseline is adjusted for baseline value. Figure 1 Add-On Combination Therapy with a Thiazolidinedione A total of 565 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONGLYZA in combination with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% to \u226410.5%) on TZD alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of pioglitazone (30-45 mg once daily) or rosiglitazone (4 mg once daily or 8 mg either once daily or in two divided doses of 4 mg) for at least 12 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received TZD at their pre-trial dose. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg of ONGLYZA or placebo in addition to their current dose of TZD. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titration of ONGLYZA or TZD was not permitted during the trial. A change in TZD regimen from rosiglitazone to pioglitazone at specified, equivalent therapeutic doses was permitted at the investigator\u2019s discretion if believed to be medically appropriate. ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to TZD provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to TZD (Table 6). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 10% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg add-on to TZD group, 6% for the ONGLYZA 5 mg add-on to TZD group, and 10% in the placebo add-on to TZD group.

To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a submaximal dose of SU for 2 months or greater. In this trial, ONGLYZA in combination with a fixed, intermediate dose of SU was compared to titration to a higher dose of SU. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 4-week, dietary and exercise lead-in period, and placed on glyburide 7.5 mg once daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients with A1C \u22657% to \u226410% were randomized to either 2.5 mg or 5 mg of ONGLYZA add-on to 7.5 mg glyburide or to placebo plus a 10 mg total daily dose of glyburide. Patients who received placebo were eligible to have glyburide up-titrated to a total daily dose of 15 mg. Up-titration of glyburide was not permitted in patients who received ONGLYZA 2.5 mg or 5 mg. Glyburide could be down-titrated in any treatment group once during the 24-week trial period due to hypoglycemia as deemed necessary by the investigator. Approximately 92% of patients in the placebo plus glyburide group were up-titrated to a final total daily dose of 15 mg during the first 4 weeks of the trial period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medication. Dose titration of ONGLYZA was not permitted during the trial. In combination with glyburide, ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and 5 mg provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group (Table 7). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 18% in the ONGLYZA 2.5 mg add-on to glyburide group, 17% in the ONGLYZA 5 mg add-on to glyburide group, and 30% in the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group.

Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: ONGLYZA 5 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl 500 mg + placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. ONGLYZA was dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2,000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of ONGLYZA 5 mg plus metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin (Table 8).

Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (at least 1,500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl (1,500-3,000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of ONGLYZA or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, ONGLYZA and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C <9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with ONGLYZA compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p<0.0001). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters at Week 52 in an Active-Controlled Trial of ONGLYZA versus Glipizide in Combination with Metformin HCl Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial.

Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without metformin HCl) A total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONGLYZA in combination with insulin in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657.5% and \u226411%) on insulin alone (N=141) or on insulin in combination with a stable dose of metformin HCl (N=314). Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u226530 units to \u2264150 units daily) with \u226420% variation in total daily dose for \u22658 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin HCl if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either ONGLYZA 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by >20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with ONGLYZA 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using ONGLYZA 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and ONGLYZA 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin HCl (\u22120.4% and \u22120.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the ONGLYZA group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with ONGLYZA 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the ONGLYZA 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C <7% was 17% (52/300) with ONGLYZA in combination with insulin compared to 7% (10/149) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONGLYZA in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1,500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u226550% of the maximum recommended dose) for \u22658 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind ONGLYZA (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. ONGLYZA in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the ONGLYZA group and 5% in the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C <7% was 31% (39/127) with ONGLYZA in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONGLYZA added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u22657% to \u226410.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline the population had diabetes mellitus for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead in treatment period, which included open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to ONGLYZA 5 mg (N=153) or placebo (N =162). The group treated with add-on ONGLYZA had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of ONGLYZA as Add-on to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl There were 6.5% (n=10) of randomized patients in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n=5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at week 24. Of the patients who discontinued trial medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at week 24.

In this trial, 98% of the patients were using background antidiabetic medications (75% were using insulin and 31% were using oral antidiabetic medications, mostly sulfonylureas). After 12 weeks of treatment, ONGLYZA 2.5 mg provided significant improvement in A1C compared to placebo (Table 13). In the subgroup of patients with ESRD, ONGLYZA and placebo resulted in comparable reductions in A1C from baseline to Week 12. This finding is inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment. After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean change in FPG was \u221212 mg/dL with ONGLYZA 2.5 mg and \u221213 mg/dL with placebo. Compared to placebo, the mean change in FPG with ONGLYZA was \u221212 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with moderate renal impairment, \u22124 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with severe renal impairment, and +44 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with ESRD. These findings are inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment.

Of the randomized trial patients, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years. The trial was event-driven, and patients were followed until a sufficient number of events were accrued. Patients were at least 40 years of age, had A1C \u22656.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized patients) for cardiovascular disease (age \u226555 years for men and \u226560 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized patients) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u226530 to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) to severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. Patients had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years, and a mean baseline A1C level of 8.0%. Approximately 5% of patients were treated with diet and exercise only at baseline. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (ACE inhibitors or ARBs 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and was also powered for a superiority comparison if non-inferiority was demonstrated. The results of SAVOR, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 14. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on ONGLYZA. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with ONGLYZA relative to placebo was 1.00 with a 95.1% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.

The curves for both ONGLYZA and placebo arms are close together throughout the duration of the trial. The estimated cumulative event probability is approximately linear for both arms, indicating that the incidence of MACE for both arms was constant over the trial duration. Figure 2: Cumulative Percent of Time to First MACE Vital status was obtained for 99% of patients in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the ONGLYZA group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all cause (Table 15) was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are a combination of saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and metformin hydrochloride (HCl), a biguanide, indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: \u2022 Not recommended for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Limitations of Use Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Administer once daily with the evening meal. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Individualize the starting dosage based on the patient\u2019s current regimen then adjust the dosage based on effectiveness and tolerability. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Do not exceed a daily dosage of 5 mg saxagliptin/2,000 mg metformin HCl extended-release. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Swallow whole. Never crush, cut, or chew. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Limit the saxagliptin dosage to 2.5 mg daily for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Assess renal function prior to initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and periodically thereafter. ( 2.2 ) o Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 - 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Assess risk/benefit of continuing if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Limit the saxagliptin component to 2.5 mg daily if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . \u2022 Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage and Administration Individualize the starting dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets based on the patient\u2019s current regimen and the available strengths of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [ see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ]. Administer saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets once daily with the evening meal, with gradual dose titration to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin HCl [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The recommended starting dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who need 5 mg of saxagliptin and who are not currently treated with metformin HCl is one saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet containing 5 mg saxagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl extended-release once daily with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to metformin HCl. In patients treated with metformin HCl, the recommended starting dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should provide metformin HCl at the dose already being taken, or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose. Following a switch from metformin HCl immediate-release to saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, closely monitor glycemic control and adjust the dosage accordingly. Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl extended-release may be treated with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 2.5 mg/1,000 mg. Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin who are either metformin HCl naive or who require a dose of metformin HCl higher than 1,000 mg should use the individual components. Gradually titrate the dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as needed, after assessing therapeutic response and tolerability, up to a maximum recommended dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets (5 mg for saxagliptin and 2,000 mg for metformin HCl extended-release orally once daily). Inform patients that saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed, cut, or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass that may resemble the original tablet. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. 2.2 Recommendations for Dosage and Administration in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and then as clinically indicated [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. The recommended dosage of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. In patients taking saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy and limit dose of the saxagliptin component to 2.5 mg once daily. Initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 \u2013 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is not recommended. Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematological parameters annually. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity-Related Events: There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions in patients treated with saxagliptin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The post-marketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: \u2022 Before initiating saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \u2022 Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 [ see Contraindications (4) ]. \u2022 Initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . \u2022 Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \u2022 In patients taking saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been post-marketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.3 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.4 Vitamin B 12 Concentrations In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Saxagliptin When saxagliptin was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Metformin HCl Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.7 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been post-marketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP4 inhibitor. Consider DPP4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.8 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin HCl In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in > 5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of trial medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release. Saxagliptin The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin HCl, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg N = 882 Placebo N = 799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u2265 5% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adverse Reactions Associated with Saxagliptin Coadministered with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u2265 5% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered saxagliptin and metformin HCl in treatment-naive patients. Table 2: Coadministration of Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with Combination Therapy of Saxagliptin 5 mg Plus Metformin HCl Immediate-Release (and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release Alone) Number (%) of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl Metformin HCl immediate-release was initiated at a starting dose of 500 mg daily and titrated up to a maximum of 2,000 mg daily. N = 320 Placebo + Metformin HCl N = 328 Headache 24 (7.5) 17 (5.2) Nasopharyngitis 22 (6.9) 13 (4.0) In patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release, either as saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy or as coadministration in treatment-naive patients, diarrhea was the only gastrointestinal-related event that occurred with an incidence \u2265 5% in any treatment group in both trials. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of diarrhea was 9.9%, 5.8%, and 11.2% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of diarrhea was 6.9% in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release group and 7.3% in the placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release group. Hypoglycemia In the saxagliptin clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively. In the add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.8% with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5.8% with saxagliptin 5 mg, and 5% with placebo. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in patients given saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release and 4% in patients given placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p < 0.0001). In the saxagliptin add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). Among the patients using insulin in combination with metformin HCl, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was 4.8% with saxagliptin versus 1.9% with placebo. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Saxagliptin Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine > 6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for saxagliptin-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from > 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u2264 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections Saxagliptin In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin that remained stable throughout saxagliptin treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin use. Causality has not been established and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in a saxagliptin-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin use. Vital Signs Saxagliptin No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin alone or in combination with metformin HCl. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts Saxagliptin There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl were coadministered in treatment-naive patients compared to placebo and metformin HCl. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264 750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. Vitamin B 12 Concentrations Metformin HCl In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, saxagliptin, or metformin HCl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Coadministration with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets significantly increases saxagliptin concentrations. Limit saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets dosage to 2.5 mg/1,000 mg once daily when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: May increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Drugs that reduce metformin clearance : May increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider benefits and risks of concomitant use. ( 7.3 ) \u2022 See full prescribing information for additional drug interactions. ( 7 ) 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). The dose of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be limited to 2.5 mg of saxagliptin when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. 7.3 Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2]/multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. 7.4 Alcohol Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 7.5 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Concomitant use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with insulin or an insulin secretagogue may require lower dosages of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.6 Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These medications include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or saxagliptin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published trials with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [ see Data ]. No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin and metformin were administered separately or in combination to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, still birth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data Saxagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. Metformin HCl Metformin HCl did not cause adverse developmental effect when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2,000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. Saxagliptin and Metformin Saxagliptin and metformin coadministered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not result in adverse developmental effects considered clinically relevant in either species. Doses tested in rats provided exposure up to 100- and 10-times clinical exposure, and doses tested in rabbits provided exposure up to 249- and 1-times clinical exposure relative to the clinical dose of 5 mg saxagliptin and 2,000 mg metformin. Minor skeletal abnormalities associated with maternal toxicity were observed in rats. In rabbits, coadministration was poorly tolerated in a subset of mothers (12 of 30), resulting in death, moribundity, or abortion. However, among surviving mothers with evaluable litters, maternal toxicity was limited to marginal reductions in body weight over the course of gestation days 21 to 29, associated with fetal body weight decrements of 7%, and a low incidence of delayed ossification of the fetal hyoid bone. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of saxagliptin and metformin or saxagliptin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [ see Data ]. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Saxagliptin is present in the milk of lactating rats [ see Data ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. Animal Data No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined components of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In studies performed with the individual components, both saxagliptin and metformin are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness of saxagliptin was not demonstrated in a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 26-week safety extension (NCT03199053) in 164 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Assess renal function more frequently in the elderly [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Saxagliptin In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Metformin HCl Controlled clinical trials of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Saxagliptin In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was administered to 85 patients with moderate (n = 48) or severe (n = 18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n = 19) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four saxagliptin-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL). Metformin HCl Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain two antihyperglycemic medications: saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a biguanide. Saxagliptin Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin HCl Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or in healthy subjects except in unusual circumstances [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology Saxagliptin In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Bioequivalence and food effect of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets were characterized under low calorie diet. The low calorie diet consisted of 324 kcal with meal composition that contained 11.1% protein, 10.5% fat, and 78.4% carbohydrate. The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of saxagliptin (ONGLYZA \u00ae ) and metformin HCl extended-release as individual tablets under fed conditions. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Metformin HCl Metformin extended-release C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. At steady state, the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin extended-release within the range of 500 to 2,000 mg. After repeated administration of metformin extended-release, metformin did not accumulate in plasma. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels of metformin extended-release tablets are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin immediate-release tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar between extended-release tablets and immediate-release tablets. Absorption Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Metformin HCl Following a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Effect of Food Saxagliptin Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin when administered as saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release combination tablets. Metformin HCl Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin extended-release. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin when administered as saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release combination tablets. Distribution Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metformin HCl Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins. Elimination Metabolism Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Metformin HCl Intravenous single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~ 230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~ 120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Metformin HCl Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Male and Female Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender (males = 19, females = 16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Racial or Ethnic Groups Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Metformin HCl No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n = 249), Black or African American (n = 51), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (n = 24). Patients with Renal Impairment Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were > 2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Metformin HCl In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been performed, although such studies have been conducted with the individual saxagliptin and metformin components. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets contain two antihyperglycemic medications: saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a biguanide. Saxagliptin Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin HCl Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or in healthy subjects except in unusual circumstances [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology Saxagliptin In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD)."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Bioequivalence and food effect of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets were characterized under low calorie diet. The low calorie diet consisted of 324 kcal with meal composition that contained 11.1% protein, 10.5% fat, and 78.4% carbohydrate. The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of saxagliptin (ONGLYZA \u00ae ) and metformin HCl extended-release as individual tablets under fed conditions. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Metformin HCl Metformin extended-release C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. At steady state, the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin extended-release within the range of 500 to 2,000 mg. After repeated administration of metformin extended-release, metformin did not accumulate in plasma. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels of metformin extended-release tablets are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin immediate-release tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar between extended-release tablets and immediate-release tablets. Absorption Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Metformin HCl Following a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Effect of Food Saxagliptin Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin when administered as saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release combination tablets. Metformin HCl Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin extended-release. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin when administered as saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release combination tablets. Distribution Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metformin HCl Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins. Elimination Metabolism Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Metformin HCl Intravenous single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~ 230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~ 120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Metformin HCl Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Male and Female Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender (males = 19, females = 16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Racial or Ethnic Groups Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Metformin HCl No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n = 249), Black or African American (n = 51), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (n = 24). Patients with Renal Impairment Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were > 2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Metformin HCl In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been performed, although such studies have been conducted with the individual saxagliptin and metformin components. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Saxagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The following data are based on studies with saxagliptin and metformin administered individually. Saxagliptin Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity was evaluated in 2-year studies conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice dosed orally at 50, 250, and 600 mg/kg up to 870-times (males) and 1165-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in rats dosed orally at 25, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg up to 355-times (males) and 2217-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Mutagenesis Saxagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity tests (Ames bacterial mutagenesis, human and rat lymphocyte cytogenetics, rat bone marrow micronucleus and DNA repair assays). The active metabolite of saxagliptin was not mutagenic in an Ames bacterial assay. Impairment of Fertility Saxagliptin administered to rats had no effect on fertility or the ability to maintain a litter at exposures up to 603-times and 776-times the 5 mg clinical dose in males and females, based on AUC. Metformin HCl Carcinogenesis Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1,500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. Mutagenesis There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test ( S. typhimurium ), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Impairment of Fertility Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Saxagliptin Saxagliptin produced adverse skin changes in the extremities of cynomolgus monkeys (scabs and/or ulceration of tail, digits, scrotum, and/or nose). Skin lesions were reversible within exposure approximately 20-times the 5 mg clinical dose, but in some cases were irreversible and necrotizing at higher exposures. Adverse skin changes were not observed at exposures similar to (1- to 3-times) the 5 mg clinical dose. Clinical correlates to skin lesions in monkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Efficacy Trials The effectiveness of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets has been established in clinical trials of coadministration of oral saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release tablets in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone and in treatment-naive patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise alone. In these two trials, treatment with saxagliptin dosed in the morning plus metformin HCl immediate-release tablets at all doses produced statistically significant improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in A1C were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. In these two trials, decrease in body weight in the treatment groups given saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl immediate-release was similar to that in the groups given metformin HCl immediate-release alone. Saxagliptin plus metformin HCl immediate-release was not associated with significant changes from baseline in fasting serum lipids compared to metformin HCl alone. The coadministration of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release tablets has also been evaluated in an active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin to glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, in a placebo-controlled trial where a subgroup of 314 patients inadequately controlled on insulin plus metformin HCl received add-on therapy with saxagliptin or placebo, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 257 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea, and a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 315 patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl. In a 24-week, double-blind, randomized trial, patients treated with metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg twice daily for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continued treatment with metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg twice daily or to metformin HCl extended-release either 1,000 mg once daily or 1,500 mg once daily. The mean change in A1C from baseline to Week 24 was 0.1% (95% confidence interval 0%, 0.3%) for the metformin HCl immediate-release treatment arm, 0.3% (95% confidence interval 0.1%, 0.4%) for the 1,000 mg metformin HCl extended-release treatment arm, and 0.1% (95% confidence interval 0%, 0.3%) for the 1,500 mg metformin HCl extended-release treatment arm. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin HCl immediate-release treatment may be safely switched to metformin HCl extended-release once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2,000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin HCl immediate-release to metformin HCl extended-release, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly. Saxagliptin Morning and Evening Dosing A 24-week monotherapy trial was conducted to assess a range of dosing regimens for saxagliptin. Treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled diabetes (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10%) underwent a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period. A total of 365 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of saxagliptin, or placebo. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy added on to placebo or saxagliptin; the number of patients randomized per treatment group ranged from 71 to 74. Treatment with either saxagliptin 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of -0.4% and -0.3%, respectively). Coadministration of Saxagliptin with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients A total of 1306 treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin coadministered with metformin HCl immediate-release in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 8% to \u2264 12%) on diet and exercise alone. Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg + placebo (the maximum recommended approved saxagliptin dose is 5 mg daily; the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin does not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose and the 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage). Saxagliptin was dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl immediate-release, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2,000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during this trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl immediate-release provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin HCl immediate-release (Table 7). Table 7: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Coadministration with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1,500-2,550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl immediate-release at their pre-trial dose, up to 2500 mg daily, for the duration of the trial. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl immediate-release (the maximum recommended approved saxagliptin dose is 5 mg daily; the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin does not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose and the 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage). Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were not permitted. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release (Table 8). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group, 13% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group.

Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl immediate-release (at least 1,500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl immediate-release (1,500-3,000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of saxagliptin or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl immediate-release. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl immediate-release group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264 110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C < 9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p < 0.0001). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters at Week 52 in an Active-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin versus Glipizide in Combination with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial. Efficacy Parameter Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl N = 428 Titrated Glipizide + Metformin HCl N = 430 Hemoglobin A1C (%) N = 423 N = 423 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean) -0.6 -0.7 Difference from glipizide + metformin HCl (adjusted mean Least squares mean adjusted for baseline value. ) 0.1 95% Confidence Interval (-0.02, 0.2) Saxagliptin + metformin HCl is considered non-inferior to glipizide + metformin HCl because the upper limit of this confidence interval is less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.35%.

Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin HCl Immediate-Release) A total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with insulin in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7.5% and \u2264 11%) on insulin alone (N = 141) or on insulin in combination with a stable dose of metformin HCl immediate-release (N = 314). Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u2265 30 units to \u2264 150 units daily) with \u2264 20% variation in total daily dose for \u2265 8 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin HCl immediate-release if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by > 20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin HCl immediate-release (-0.4% and -0.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the saxagliptin group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the saxagliptin 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to insulin rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 17% (52/300) with saxagliptin in combination with insulin compared to 7% (10/149) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% and \u2264 10%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1,500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u2265 50% of the maximum recommended dose) for \u2265 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group. Table 11: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea Intent-to-treat population using last observation prior to discontinuation.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Saxagliptin Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u2265 7% to \u2264 10.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u2265 1,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead-in treatment period, which included 16 weeks of open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to saxagliptin 5 mg (N = 153) or placebo (N = 162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl There were 6.5% (n = 10) of randomized patients in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n = 5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at week 24. Of the patients who discontinued trial medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at week 24.

Figure 1: Mean Change from Baseline in A1C in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Trial The cardiovascular risk of saxagliptin was evaluated in SAVOR, a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing saxagliptin (N = 8280) to placebo (N = 8212), both administered in combination with standard of care, in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Of the randomized trial patients, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years. The trial was event-driven, and patients were followed until a sufficient number of events were accrued. Patients were at least 40 years of age, had A1C \u2265 6.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized patients) for cardiovascular disease (age \u2265 55 years for men and \u2265 60 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized patients) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u2265 30 to \u2264 50 mL/min) to severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. Patients had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years, and a mean baseline A1C level of 8.0%. Approximately 5% of patients were treated with diet and exercise only at baseline. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death, or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE, and was also powered for a superiority comparison if non-inferiority was demonstrated. The results of SAVOR, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint are shown in Table 13. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on saxagliptin. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with saxagliptin relative to placebo was 1.00 with a 95.1% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.

The curves for both saxagliptin and placebo arms are close together throughout the duration of the trial. The estimated cumulative event probability is approximately linear for both arms, indicating that the incidence of MACE for both arms was constant over the trial duration. Figure 2: Cumulative Percent of Time to First MACE Vital status was obtained for 99% of patients in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all cause (Table 14) was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

( 2.1 ) \u2022 Patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease): Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg once daily regardless of meals. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Assess renal function before starting saxagliptin tablets and periodically thereafter. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Limit the dosage of Saxagliptin tablets to 2.5 mg daily for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. Do not cut, crush, or chew Saxagliptin tablets. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of saxagliptin tablets and then as clinically indicated [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. The recommended dosage of saxagliptin tablets in patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 45 mL/ minute /1.73 m 2 is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. The dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg orally once daily for patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 w[hich includes a subset of moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis] [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Saxagliptin tablets should be administered following hemodialysis. Saxagliptin tablets have not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Dosage Adjustment with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg orally once daily when used concomitantly with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination wtih Saxagliptin tablets ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity-Related Events There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue saxagliptin, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Preexisting risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of saxagliptin, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using saxagliptin. 5.2 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of saxagliptin. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When saxagliptin was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with saxagliptin [ see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin. 5.5 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.6 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, saxagliptin should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Heart Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Severe and disabling arthralgia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Bullous pemphigoid [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5% and more often than placebo) are upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Peripheral edema was reported more commonly in patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin and a thiazolidinedione (TZD) than in patients treated with the combination of placebo and TZD. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Efficacy Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years of age or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, other races 10.5% and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u2265 60mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials* Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg N=882 Placebo N=799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u2265 5% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse reactions including serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. In the add-on to glyburide trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg (13.3% and 14.6%) versus placebo (10.1%). The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia in this trial , defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of \u2264 50 mg/dL, was 2.4% and 0.8% for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg and 0.7% for placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively, 7.8% and 5.8% versus 5% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 4.1% and 2.7% versus 3.8% given as add-on therapy to TZD. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl and 4% in patients given metformin HCl alone. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p< 0.0001). In the add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). In the add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5- trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine >6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 for saxagliptin-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from >50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u2264 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin that remained stable throughout saxagliptin treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin use. Causality has not been estimated and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in an saxagliptin-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin use. Vital Signs No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin HCl compared to metformin HCl alone. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264 750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of saxagliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis \u2022 Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \u2022 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Rhabdomyolysis, Severe and disabling arthralgia \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Bullous pemphigoid"

      "Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin HCl compared to metformin HCl alone. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264 750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with saxagliptin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriages. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis and in pregnant and lactating rats during the pre- and postnatal period [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, still birth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of saxagliptin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Saxagliptin is present in the milk of lactating rats [see Data] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for saxagliptin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from saxagliptin or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of saxagliptin as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established. in pediatric patients.. Effectiveness of saxagliptin tablets was not demonstrated in a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 26-week safety extension (NCT03199053) in 164 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 8.5 Geriatric Use In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4751 (42%) of the 11301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Saxagliptin and its active metabolite are eliminated in part by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection in the elderly based on renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2)and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was administered orally to 85 patients with moderate (n=48) or severe (n=18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n=19) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four saxagliptin-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. . Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Saxagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18 to 40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD)."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. . Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Saxagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18 to 40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice dosed orally at 50, 250, and 600 mg/kg up to 870-times (males) and 1165-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in rats dosed orally at 25, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg up to 355-times (males) and 2217-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Mutagenesis Saxagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity tests (Ames bacterial mutagenesis, human and rat lymphocyte cytogenetics, rat bone marrow micronucleus and DNA repair assays). The active metabolite of saxagliptin was not mutagenic in an Ames bacterial assay. Impairment of Fertility Saxagliptin administered to rats had no effect on fertility or the ability to maintain a litter at exposures up to 603-times and 776-times the 5 mg clinical dose in males and females, based on AUC. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Saxagliptin produced adverse skin changes in the extremities of cynomolgus monkeys (scabs and/or ulceration of tail, digits, scrotum, and/or nose). Skin lesions were reversible within exposure approximately 20-times the 5 mg clinical dose, but in some cases were irreversible and necrotizing at higher exposures. Adverse skin changes were not observed at exposures similar to (1- to 3-times) the 5 mg clinical dose. Clinical correlates to skin lesions in monkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin."

A total of 3021 patients in these trials were treated with saxagliptin. In these trials, the mean age was 54 years, and 71% of patients were White, 16% were Asian, 4% were Black or African American, and 9% were of other racial groups. An additional 423 patients, including 315 who received saxagliptin, participated in a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of 6 to 12 weeks in duration. In these six, double-blind trials, saxagliptin was evaluated at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg once daily. Three of these trials also evaluated an saxagliptin dose of 10 mg daily. The 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin did not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg and 2.5 mg doses produced statistically significant improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in A1C were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. Saxagliptin was not associated with significant changes from baseline in body weight or fasting serum lipids compared to placebo. Saxagliptin has also been evaluated in five additional trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin to glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 455 patients inadequately controlled on insulin alone or on insulin in combination with metformin HCl, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 257 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 315 patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl, and a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 170 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD. Monotherapy A total of 766 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on diet and exercise (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10%) participated in two 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin monotherapy. In the first trial, following a 2-week single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period, 401 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy, added on to placebo or saxagliptin. Efficacy was evaluated at the last measurement prior to rescue therapy for patients needing rescue. Dose titration of saxagliptin was not permitted. Treatment with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 16% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg treatment group, 20% in the saxagliptin 5 mg treatment group, and 26% in the placebo group.

Treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10%) underwent a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period. A total of 365 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of saxagliptin, or placebo. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy added on to placebo or saxagliptin; the number of patients randomized per treatment group ranged from 71 to 74. Treatment with either saxagliptin 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of \u22120.4% and \u22120.3%, respectively). Treatment with saxagliptin 2.5 mg every morning also provided significant improvement in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reduction of \u22120.4%). Combination Therapy Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl A total of 743 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% and \u2264 10%) on metformin HCl alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1500 to 2550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl at their pre-trial dose, up to 2500 mg daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. The 10 mg dosage of saxagliptin is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of saxagliptin and metformin HCl were not permitted. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin HCl (Table 5). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to metformin HCl group, 13% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin HCl group.

Week 24 (LOCF) includes intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy for patients needing rescue. Mean change from baseline is adjusted for baseline value. Add-On Combination Therapy with a Thiazolidinedione A total of 565 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10.5%) on TZD alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of pioglitazone (30 to 45 mg once daily) or rosiglitazone (4 mg once daily or 8 mg either once daily or in two divided doses of 4 mg) for at least 12 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received TZD at their pre-trial dose. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of TZD. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titration of saxagliptin or TZD was not permitted during the trial. A change in TZD regimen from rosiglitazone to pioglitazone at specified, equivalent therapeutic doses was permitted at the investigator\u2019s discretion if believed to be medically appropriate. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to TZD provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to TZD (Table 6). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 10% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to TZD group, 6% for the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to TZD group, and 10% in the placebo add-on to TZD group.

To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a submaximal dose of SU for 2 months or greater. In this trial, saxagliptin in combination with a fixed, intermediate dose of SU was compared to titration to a higher dose of SU. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 4-week, dietary and exercise lead-in period, and placed on glyburide 7.5 mg once daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients with A1C \u2265 7% to \u2264 10% were randomized to either 2.5 mg or 5 mg of saxagliptin add-on to 7.5 mg glyburide or to placebo plus a 10 mg total daily dose of glyburide. Patients who received placebo were eligible to have glyburide up-titrated to a total daily dose of 15 mg. Up-titration of glyburide was not permitted in patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg or 5 mg. Glyburide could be down-titrated in any treatment group once during the 24-week trial period due to hypoglycemia as deemed necessary by the investigator. Approximately 92% of patients in the placebo plus glyburide group were up-titrated to a final total daily dose of 15 mg during the first 4 weeks of the trial period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medication. Dose titration of saxagliptin was not permitted during the trial. In combination with glyburide, saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group (Table 7). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 18% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to glyburide group, 17% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to glyburide group, and 30% in the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group.

Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl 500 mg + placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. Saxagliptin was dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trials were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin HCl (Table 8). Table 8: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Coadministration with Metformin HCl in Treatment-Naive Patients* Efficacy Parameter Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl N=320 Placebo + Metformin HCl N=328 Hemoglobin A1C (%) N=306 N=313 Baseline (mean) 9.4 9.4 Change from baseline (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u22122.5 \u22122 Difference from placebo + metformin HCl (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u22120.5 \u2021 - 95% Confidence Interval (\u22120.7, \u22120.4) - Percent of patients achieving A1C <7% 60% \u00a7 (185/307) 41% (129/314) Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dL) N=315 N=320 Baseline (mean) 199 199 Change from baseline (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u221260 \u221247 Difference from placebo + metformin HCl (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u221213 \u00a7 - 95% Confidence Interval (\u221219, \u22126) - 2-hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dL) N=146 N=141 Baseline (mean) 340 355 Change from baseline (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u2212138 \u221297 Difference from placebo + metformin HCl (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u221241 \u00a7 - 95% Confidence Interval (\u221257, \u221225) - Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl versus Glipizide Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl . In this 52-week, active-controlled trial, a total of 858 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control (A1C >6.5% and \u2264 10%) on metformin HCl. alone were randomized to double-blind add-on therapy with saxagliptin or glipizide. Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (at least 1500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl (1500 to 3000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of saxagliptin or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264 110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C < 9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p < 0.0001).

Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u2265 30 units to \u2264 150 units daily) with \u2264 20% variation in total daily dose for \u2265 8 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin HCl if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by >20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin HCl (\u22120.4% and \u22120.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the saxagliptin group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the saxagliptin 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 17% (52/300) with saxagliptin in combination with insulin compared to 7% (10/149) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u2265 7% and \u2264 10%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u2265 50% of the maximum recommended dose) for \u2265 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C < 7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u2265 7% to \u2264 10.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% Other race. At baseline the population had diabetes mellitus for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u2265 1500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients subjects who completed the screening period entered the lead in treatment period, which included open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to saxagliptin 5 mg (N=153) or placebo (N =162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-on to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl * Saxagliptin 5 mg (N=153) \u2020 Placebo (N=162) \u2020 In combination with Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl Hemoglobin A1C (%) * Baseline (mean) 8 7.9 Change from baseline (adjusted mean \u2021 ) \u22120.5 \u22120.2 95% Confidence Interval (\u22120.6, \u22120.4) (\u22120.3, \u22120.1) Difference from placebo (adjusted mean) \u22120.4 \u00b6 95% Confidence Interval (\u22120.5, \u22120.2) The known proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% at Week 24 was 35.3% in the saxagliptin treated group compared to 23.1% in the placebo-treated group. figure1 14.2 Renal Impairment A total of 170 patients participated in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin 2.5 mg once daily compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate (n=90) or severe (n=41) renal impairment or ESRD (n=39). In this trial, 98% of the patients were using background antidiabetic medications (75% were using insulin and 31% were using oral antidiabetic medications, mostly sulfonylureas). After 12 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin 2.5 mg provided significant improvement in A1C compared to placebo (Table 13). In the subgroup of patients with ESRD, saxagliptin and placebo resulted in comparable reductions in A1C from baseline to Week 12. This finding is inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment. After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean change in FPG was \u221212 mg/dL with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and \u221213 mg/dL with placebo. Compared to placebo, the mean change in FPG with saxagliptin was \u221212 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with moderate renal impairment, \u22124 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with severe renal impairment, and +44 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with ESRD. These findings are inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment. Table 13: A1C at Week 12 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin in Patients with Renal Impairment* Efficacy Parameter Saxagliptin 2.5 mg N=85 Placebo N=85 Hemoglobin A1C (%) N=81 N=83 Baseline (mean) 8.4 8.1 Change from baseline (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u22120.9 \u22120.4 Difference from placebo (adjusted mean \u2020 ) \u22120.4 \u2021 95% Confidence Interval (\u22120.7, \u22120.1) 14.3 Cardiovascular Safety Trial The cardiovascular risk of saxagliptin was evaluated in SAVOR, a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial. comparing saxagliptin (N=8280) to placebo (N=8212), both administered in combination with standard of care, in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Of the randomizedtrial patients, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years. The trial was event-driven, and patients were followed until a sufficient number of events were accrued. Patients were at least 40 years of age, had A1C \u2265 6.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized patients) for cardiovascular disease (age \u2265 55 years for men and \u2265 60 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized patients) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u2265 30 to \u2264 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) to severe (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. Patients had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years, and a mean baseline A1C level of 8%. Approximately 5% of patients were treated with diet and exercise only at baseline. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (ACE inhibitors or ARBs 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and was also powered for a superiority comparison if non-inferiority was demonstrated. The results of SAVOR, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 14. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on saxagliptin. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with saxagliptin relative to placebo was 1.00 with a 95.1% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.

The curves for both saxagliptin and placebo arms are close together throughout the duration of the trial. The estimated cumulative event probability is approximately linear for both arms, indicating that the incidence of MACE for both arms was constant over the trial duration. Figure 2: Cumulative Percent of Time to First MACE Vital status was obtained for 99% of patients in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all cause (Table 15) was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. ( 2.1 ) Patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate or severe renal impairment, or end-stage renal disease): Recommended dosage is 2.5 mg once daily regardless of meals. ( 2.2 ) Assess renal function before starting saxagliptin tablets and periodically thereafter. ( 2.2 ) Limit the dosage of saxagliptin tablets to 2.5 mg daily for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily taken regardless of meals. Do not cut, crush, or chew saxagliptin tablets. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of saxagliptin tablets and then as clinically indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . The recommended dosage of saxagliptin tablets in patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . The dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg orally once daily for patients with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [which includes a subset of moderate or severe renal impairment, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis] [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Saxagliptin tablets should be administered following hemodialysis. Saxagliptin tablets have not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. 2.3 Dosage Modification with Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The dosage of saxagliptin tablets is 2.5 mg orally once daily when used concomitantly with strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin) [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin. ( 5.1 ) Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination with saxagliptin. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity-Related Events: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue saxagliptin, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.4 ) Arthralgia : Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.5 ) Bullous Pemphigoid : There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Preexisting risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of saxagliptin, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using saxagliptin. 5.2 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of saxagliptin. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When saxagliptin was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with saxagliptin [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ se e Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin. 5.5 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.6 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, saxagliptin should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 5.7 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine Saxagliptin tablets, 2.5 mg contain FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information: Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe and disabling arthralgia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Bullous pemphigoid [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% and more often than placebo) are upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache. ( 6.1 ) Peripheral edema was reported more commonly in patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin and a thiazolidinedione (TZD) than in patients treated with the combination of placebo and TZD. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4 % were 75 years of age or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, the population had type 2 diabetes mellitus for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR\u226560 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials* Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo * The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin hydrochloride (HCl), thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. % of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg N=882 Placebo N=799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u22655% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to adverse reactions, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. In the add-on to glyburide trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg (13.3% and 14.6%) versus placebo (10.1%). The incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia in this trial, defined as symptoms of hypoglycemia accompanied by a fingerstick glucose value of \u226450 mg/dL, was 2.4% and 0.8% for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg and 0.7% for placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively, 7.8% and 5.8% versus 5% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 4.1% and 2.7% versus 3.8% given as add-on therapy to TZD. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in treatment-naive patients given saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl and 4% in patients given metformin HCl alone. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001). In the add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). In the add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine >6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for saxagliptin-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from >50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin that remained stable throughout saxagliptin treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin use. Causality has not been estimated and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in an saxagliptin-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin use. Vital Signs No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg was given in initial combination with metformin HCl compared to metformin HCl alone. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of saxagliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Limit saxagliptin dosage to 2.5 mg once daily when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). The dosage of saxagliptin should be limited to 2.5 mg when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [ se e Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Concomitant use of saxagliptin with insulin or an insulin secretagogue may require lower dosages of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with saxagliptin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriages. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis and in pregnant and lactating rats during the pre- and postnatal period [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, still birth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of saxagliptin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Saxagliptin is present in the milk of lactating rats [see Data] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for saxagliptin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from saxagliptin or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of saxagliptin as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness of saxagliptin was not demonstrated in a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 26-week safety extension (NCT03199053) in 164 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Saxagliptin and its active metabolite are eliminated in part by the kidney. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection in the elderly based on renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was administered orally to 85 patients with moderate (n=48) or severe (n=18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n=19) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four saxagliptin-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose \u226450 mg/dL)."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Saxagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18 to 40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP-4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP-4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD)."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Absorption The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Effect of Food Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Saxagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Excretion Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18 to 40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Male and Female Patients No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Racial or Ethnic Groups No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Patients with Renal Impairment A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with (eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C), mean C max and AUC of saxagliptin were up to 8% and 77% higher, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 10 mg dose of saxagliptin. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The corresponding C max and AUC of the active metabolite were up to 59% and 33% lower, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. Body Mass Index No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by CYP3A4/5. In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Saxagliptin has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin HCl, glyburide, and thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) therapy. A total of 4148 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomized in six, double-blind, controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the safety and glycemic efficacy of saxagliptin administered orally. A total of 3021 patients in these trials were treated with saxagliptin. In these trials, the mean age was 54 years, and 71% of patients were White, 16% were Asian, 4% were Black or African American, and 9% were of other racial groups. An additional 423 patients, including 315 who received saxagliptin, participated in a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of 6 to 12 weeks in duration. In these six, double-blind trials, saxagliptin was evaluated at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg once daily. Three of these trials also evaluated a saxagliptin dose of 10 mg daily. The 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin did not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Treatment with saxagliptin 5 mg and 2.5 mg doses produced statistically significant improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in A1C were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. Saxagliptin was not associated with significant changes from baseline in body weight or fasting serum lipids compared to placebo. Saxagliptin has also been evaluated in five additional trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: an active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin to glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 455 patients inadequately controlled on insulin alone or on insulin in combination with metformin HCl, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 257 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 315 patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl, and a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 170 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate or severe renal impairment or ESRD. Monotherapy A total of 766 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on diet and exercise (A1C \u22657% to \u226410%) participated in two 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin monotherapy. In the first trial, following a 2-week single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period, 401 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy, added on to placebo or saxagliptin. Efficacy was evaluated at the last measurement prior to rescue therapy for patients needing rescue. Dose titration of saxagliptin was not permitted. Treatment with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared to placebo (Table 4). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 16% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg treatment group, 20% in the saxagliptin 5 mg treatment group, and 26% in the placebo group.

Treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (A1C \u22657% to \u226410%) underwent a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period. A total of 365 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of saxagliptin, or placebo. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue therapy added on to placebo or saxagliptin; the number of patients randomized per treatment group ranged from 71 to 74. Treatment with either saxagliptin 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of -0.4% and -0.3%, respectively). Treatment with saxagliptin 2.5 mg every morning also provided significant improvement in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reduction of -0.4%). Combination Therapy Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl A total of 743 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%) on metformin HCl alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1,500 to 2,550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl at their pre-trial dose, up to 2,500 mg daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. The 10 mg dosage of saxagliptin is not an approved dosage. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of saxagliptin and metformin HCl were not permitted. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin HCl (Table 5). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to metformin HCl group, 13% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin HCl group.

Add-On Combination Therapy with a Thiazolidinedione A total of 565 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% to \u226410.5%) on TZD alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of pioglitazone (30 to 45 mg once daily) or rosiglitazone (4 mg once daily or 8 mg either once daily or in two divided doses of 4 mg) for at least 12 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received TZD at their pre-trial dose. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg or 5 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of TZD. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titration of saxagliptin or TZD was not permitted during the trial. A change in TZD regimen from rosiglitazone to pioglitazone at specified, equivalent therapeutic doses was permitted at the investigator\u2019s discretion if believed to be medically appropriate. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to TZD provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to TZD (Table 6). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 10% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to TZD group, 6% for the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to TZD group, and 10% in the placebo add-on to TZD group.

To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a submaximal dose of SU for 2 months or greater. In this trial, saxagliptin in combination with a fixed, intermediate dose of SU was compared to titration to a higher dose of SU. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 4-week, dietary and exercise lead-in period, and placed on glyburide 7.5 mg once daily. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients with A1C \u22657% to \u226410% were randomized to either 2.5 mg or 5 mg of saxagliptin add-on to 7.5 mg glyburide or to placebo plus a 10 mg total daily dose of glyburide. Patients who received placebo were eligible to have glyburide up-titrated to a total daily dose of 15 mg. Up-titration of glyburide was not permitted in patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg or 5 mg. Glyburide could be down-titrated in any treatment group once during the 24-week trial period due to hypoglycemia as deemed necessary by the investigator. Approximately 92% of patients in the placebo plus glyburide group were up-titrated to a final total daily dose of 15 mg during the first 4 weeks of the trial period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCl rescue, added on to existing trial medication. Dose titration of saxagliptin was not permitted during the trial. In combination with glyburide, saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group (Table 7). The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 18% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to glyburide group, 17% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to glyburide group, and 30% in the placebo plus up-titrated glyburide group.

Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl 500 mg + placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. Saxagliptin was dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2,000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trials were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin HCl (Table 8).

Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (at least 1,500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl (1,500 to 3,000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of saxagliptin or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C <9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p<0.0001).

Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u226530 units to \u2264150 units daily) with \u226420% variation in total daily dose for \u22658 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin HCl if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by >20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin HCl (\u22120.4% and \u22120.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the saxagliptin group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the saxagliptin 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C <7% was 17% (52/300) with saxagliptin in combination with insulin compared to 7% (10/149) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1,500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u226550% of the maximum recommended dose) for \u22658 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C <7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u22657% to \u226410.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline the population had diabetes mellitus for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead in treatment period, which included open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to saxagliptin 5 mg (N=153) or placebo (N=162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-on to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCl * * There were 6.5% (n=10) of randomized patients in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n=5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at week 24. Of the patients who discontinued trial medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at week 24. \u2020 Number of randomized and treated patients. \u2021 Analysis of Covariance including all post-baseline data regardless of rescue or treatment discontinuation.

Figure 1 14.2 Renal Impairment A total of 170 patients participated in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin 2.5 mg once daily compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate (n=90) or severe (n=41) renal impairment or ESRD (n=39). In this trial, 98% of the patients were using background antidiabetic medications (75% were using insulin and 31% were using oral antidiabetic medications, mostly sulfonylureas). After 12 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin 2.5 mg provided significant improvement in A1C compared to placebo (Table 13). In the subgroup of patients with ESRD, saxagliptin and placebo resulted in comparable reductions in A1C from baseline to Week 12. This finding is inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment. After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean change in FPG was \u221212 mg/dL with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and \u221213 mg/dL with placebo. Compared to placebo, the mean change in FPG with saxagliptin was \u221212 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with moderate renal impairment, \u22124 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with severe renal impairment, and +44 mg/dL in the subgroup of patients with ESRD. These findings are inconclusive because the trial was not adequately powered to show efficacy within specific subgroups of renal impairment.

Of the randomized trial patients, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years. The trial was event-driven, and patients were followed until a sufficient number of events were accrued. Patients were at least 40 years of age, had A1C \u22656.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized patients) for cardiovascular disease (age \u226555 years for men and \u226560 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized patients) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%]. The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u226530 to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) to severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. Patients had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years, and a mean baseline A1C level of 8.0%. Approximately 5% of patients were treated with diet and exercise only at baseline. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin HCl 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (ACE inhibitors or ARBs 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and was also powered for a superiority comparison if non-inferiority was demonstrated. The results of SAVOR, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 14. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on saxagliptin. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with saxagliptin relative to placebo was 1.00 with a 95.1% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3.

The curves for both saxagliptin and placebo arms are close together throughout the duration of the trial. The estimated cumulative event probability is approximately linear for both arms, indicating that the incidence of MACE for both arms was constant over the trial duration. Figure 2: Cumulative Percent of Time to First MACE Vital status was obtained for 99% of patients in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all cause (Table 15) was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

(2.1) \u2022 Individualize the starting dosage based on the patient\u2019s current regimen then adjust the dosage based on effectiveness and tolerability. (2.1) \u2022 Do not exceed a daily dosage of 5 mg saxagliptin/2,000 mg metformin HCl extended-release. (2.1) \u2022 Swallow whole. Never crush, cut, or chew. (2.1) \u2022 Limit the saxagliptin dosage to 2.5 mg daily for patients also taking strong cytochrome P450 3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). ( 2.3 , 7.1) \u2022 Assess renal function prior to initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR and periodically thereafter. (2.2) o Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 - 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Assess risk/benefit of continuing if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Limit the saxagliptin component to 2.5 mg daily if eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . o Discontinue if eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . \u2022 KOMBIGLYZE XR may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. (2.4) 2.1 Recommended Dosage and Administration Individualize the starting dosage of KOMBIGLYZE XR based on the patient\u2019s current regimen and the available strengths of KOMBIGLYZE XR [ see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ]. Administer KOMBIGLYZE XR once daily with the evening meal, with gradual dose titration to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin HCl [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The recommended starting dosage of KOMBIGLYZE XR in patients who need 5 mg of saxagliptin and who are not currently treated with metformin HCl is one KOMBIGLYZE XR tablet containing 5 mg saxagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl extended-release once daily with gradual dose escalation to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to metformin HCl. In patients treated with metformin HCl, the recommended starting dosage of KOMBIGLYZE XR should provide metformin HCl at the dose already being taken, or the nearest therapeutically appropriate dose. Following a switch from metformin HCl immediate-release to KOMBIGLYZE XR, closely monitor glycemic control and adjust the dosage accordingly. Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl extended-release may be treated with KOMBIGLYZE XR 2.5 mg/1,000 mg. Patients who need 2.5 mg saxagliptin who are either metformin HCl naive or who require a dose of metformin HCl higher than 1,000 mg should use the individual components. Gradually titrate the dosage of KOMBIGLYZE XR, as needed, after assessing therapeutic response and tolerability, up to a maximum recommended dosage of KOMBIGLYZE XR (5 mg for saxagliptin and 2,000 mg for metformin HCl extended-release orally once daily). Inform patients that KOMBIGLYZE XR tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed, cut, or chewed. Occasionally, the inactive ingredients of KOMBIGLYZE XR will be eliminated in the feces as a soft, hydrated mass that may resemble the original tablet. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to take an extra dose. Resume treatment with the next dose. 2.2 Recommendations for Dosage and Administration in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR and then as clinically indicated [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. The recommended dosage of KOMBIGLYZE XR in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. In patients taking KOMBIGLYZE XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy and limit dose of the saxagliptin component to 2.5 mg once daily. Initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR in patients with an eGFR between 30 \u2013 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 is not recommended. KOMBIGLYZE XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2.

(5.2) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of KOMBIGLYZE XR in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematological parameters annually. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination with KOMBIGLYZE XR. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity-Related Events: There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions in patients treated with saxagliptin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid : There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR ( 5.8 ). 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of KOMBIGLYZE XR. In KOMBIGLYZE XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The post-marketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: \u2022 Before initiating KOMBIGLYZE XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \u2022 KOMBIGLYZE XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 [ see Contraindications (4) ]. \u2022 Initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . \u2022 Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking KOMBIGLYZE XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \u2022 In patients taking KOMBIGLYZE XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions : The concomitant use of KOMBIGLYZE XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast : Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop KOMBIGLYZE XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart KOMBIGLYZE XR if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures : Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. KOMBIGLYZE XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States : Several of the post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR. Excessive Alcohol Intake : Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR. Hepatic Impairment : Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of KOMBIGLYZE XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been post-marketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using KOMBIGLYZE XR. 5.3 Heart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of KOMBIGLYZE XR prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of KOMBIGLYZE XR. 5.4 Vitamin B 12 Concentrations In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on KOMBIGLYZE XR and manage any abnormalities [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Saxagliptin When saxagliptin was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with KOMBIGLYZE XR. Metformin HCl Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with KOMBIGLYZE XR. 5.7 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been post-marketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP4 inhibitor. Consider DPP4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.8 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP 4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP 4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, KOMBIGLYZE XR should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",
      "5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis.

Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using KOMBIGLYZE XR.",
      "5.4 Vitamin B 12 Concentrations In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on KOMBIGLYZE XR and manage any abnormalities [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].",
      "5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Saxagliptin When saxagliptin was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with KOMBIGLYZE XR. Metformin HCl Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.",
      "5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with KOMBIGLYZE XR.",
      "5.7 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been post-marketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP4 inhibitor. Consider DPP4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate.",
      "5.8 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP 4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP 4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, KOMBIGLYZE XR should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin HCl In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in >5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of trial medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release. Saxagliptin The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u226560mL/min/1.73m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin HCl, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg N=882 Placebo N=799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u22655% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adverse Reactions Associated with Saxagliptin Coadministered with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered saxagliptin and metformin HCl in treatment-naive patients. Table 2: Coadministration of Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with Combination Therapy of Saxagliptin 5 mg Plus Metformin HCl Immediate-Release (and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release Alone Number (%) of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl Metformin HCl immediate-release was initiated at a starting dose of 500 mg daily and titrated up to a maximum of 2,000 mg daily. N=320 Placebo + MetforminHCl N=328 Headache 24 (7.5) 17 (5.2) Nasopharyngitis 22 (6.9) 13 (4.0) In patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release, either as saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy or as coadministration in treatment-naive patients, diarrhea was the only gastrointestinal-related event that occurred with an incidence \u22655% in any treatment group in both trials. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of diarrhea was 9.9%, 5.8%, and 11.2% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of diarrhea was 6.9% in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release group and 7.3% in the placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release group. Hypoglycemia In the saxagliptin clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively. In the add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.8% with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5.8% with saxagliptin 5 mg, and 5% with placebo. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in patients given saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release and 4% in patients given placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001). In the saxagliptin add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). Among the patients using insulin in combination with metformin HCl, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was 4.8% with saxagliptin versus 1.9% with placebo. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Saxagliptin Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine >6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 for saxagliptin-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from >50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections Saxagliptin In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin that remained stable throughout saxagliptin treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin use. Causality has not been established and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in a saxagliptin-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin use. Vital Signs Saxagliptin No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin alone or in combination with metformin HCl. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts Saxagliptin There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl were coadministered in treatment-naive patients compared to placebo and metformin HCl. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. Vitamin B 12 Concentrations Metformin HCl In metformin clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KOMBIGLYZE XR, saxagliptin, or metformin HCl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Saxagliptin \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis \u2022 Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \u2022 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis, Severe and disabling arthralgia \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Bullous pemphigoid Metformin HCl \u2022 Hepatobiliary Disorders : Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury",
      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin HCl In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in >5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of trial medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release. Saxagliptin The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u226560mL/min/1.73m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin HCl, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg N=882 Placebo N=799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u22655% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Adverse Reactions Associated with Saxagliptin Coadministered with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered saxagliptin and metformin HCl in treatment-naive patients. Table 2: Coadministration of Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with Combination Therapy of Saxagliptin 5 mg Plus Metformin HCl Immediate-Release (and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release Alone Number (%) of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl Metformin HCl immediate-release was initiated at a starting dose of 500 mg daily and titrated up to a maximum of 2,000 mg daily. N=320 Placebo + MetforminHCl N=328 Headache 24 (7.5) 17 (5.2) Nasopharyngitis 22 (6.9) 13 (4.0) In patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release, either as saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy or as coadministration in treatment-naive patients, diarrhea was the only gastrointestinal-related event that occurred with an incidence \u22655% in any treatment group in both trials. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of diarrhea was 9.9%, 5.8%, and 11.2% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of diarrhea was 6.9% in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release group and 7.3% in the placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release group. Hypoglycemia In the saxagliptin clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively. In the add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.8% with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5.8% with saxagliptin 5 mg, and 5% with placebo. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in patients given saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release and 4% in patients given placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001). In the saxagliptin add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). Among the patients using insulin in combination with metformin HCl, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was 4.8% with saxagliptin versus 1.9% with placebo. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Saxagliptin Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine >6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73m 2 for saxagliptin-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from >50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u226450 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections Saxagliptin In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin that remained stable throughout saxagliptin treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin use. Causality has not been established and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in a saxagliptin-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin use. Vital Signs Saxagliptin No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin alone or in combination with metformin HCl. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts Saxagliptin There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl were coadministered in treatment-naive patients compared to placebo and metformin HCl. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. Vitamin B 12 Concentrations Metformin HCl In metformin clinical trials of 29 week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.",
      "Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin HCl In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in >5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of trial medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release. Saxagliptin The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u226560mL/min/1.73m 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin HCl, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue.

In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].",

      "Adverse Reactions Associated with Saxagliptin Coadministered with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered saxagliptin and metformin HCl in treatment-naive patients. Table 2: Coadministration of Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22655% of Patients Treated with Combination Therapy of Saxagliptin 5 mg Plus Metformin HCl Immediate-Release (and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release Alone Number (%) of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl Metformin HCl immediate-release was initiated at a starting dose of 500 mg daily and titrated up to a maximum of 2,000 mg daily.

In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of diarrhea was 9.9%, 5.8%, and 11.2% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of diarrhea was 6.9% in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release group and 7.3% in the placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release group.",
      "Hypoglycemia In the saxagliptin clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively. In the add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.8% with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5.8% with saxagliptin 5 mg, and 5% with placebo. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in patients given saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release and 4% in patients given placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p<0.0001). In the saxagliptin add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u226450 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). Among the patients using insulin in combination with metformin HCl, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was 4.8% with saxagliptin versus 1.9% with placebo. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo.

      "Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts Saxagliptin There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl were coadministered in treatment-naive patients compared to placebo and metformin HCl. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) : Coadministration with KOMBIGLYZE XR significantly increases saxagliptin concentrations. Limit KOMBIGLYZE XR dosage to 2.5 mg/1,000 mg once daily when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors : May increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. (7.2) \u2022 Drugs that reduce metformin clearance : May increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider benefits and risks of concomitant use. (7.3) \u2022 See full prescribing information for additional drug interactions. ( 7 ) 7.1 Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 Enzymes Ketoconazole significantly increased saxagliptin exposure. Similar significant increases in plasma concentrations of saxagliptin are anticipated with other strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin). The dose of KOMBIGLYZE XR should be limited to 2.5 mg of saxagliptin when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently causes a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with KOMBIGLYZE XR may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. 7.3 Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2]/multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. 7.4 Alcohol Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR. 7.5 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. Concomitant use of KOMBIGLYZE XR with insulin or an insulin secretagogue may require lower dosages of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 7.6 Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These medications include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Geriatric Use : Assess renal function more frequently. (8.5) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment : Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. (8.7) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with KOMBIGLYZE XR or saxagliptin in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published trials with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [ see Data ]. No adverse developmental effects independent of maternal toxicity were observed when saxagliptin and metformin were administered separately or in combination to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis [ see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c greater than 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with an HbA1c greater than 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, still birth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data Saxagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, saxagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, corresponding to the first trimester of human pregnancy. No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. Metformin HCI Metformin hydrochloride did not cause adverse developmental effect when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2,000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. Saxagliptin and Metformin Saxagliptin and metformin coadministered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not result in adverse developmental effects considered clinically relevant in either species. Doses tested in rats provided exposure up to 100- and 10-times clinical exposure, and doses tested in rabbits provided exposure up to 249- and 1-times clinical exposure relative to the clinical dose of 5 mg saxagliptin and 2,000 mg metformin. Minor skeletal abnormalities associated with maternal toxicity were observed in rats. In rabbits, coadministration was poorly tolerated in a subset of mothers (12 of 30), resulting in death, moribundity, or abortion. However, among surviving mothers with evaluable litters, maternal toxicity was limited to marginal reductions in body weight over the course of gestation days 21 to 29, associated with fetal body weight decrements of 7%, and a low incidence of delayed ossification of the fetal hyoid bone. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of KOMBIGLYZE XR or saxagliptin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [ see Data ]. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Saxagliptin is present in the milk of lactating rats [ see Data ]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for KOMBIGLYZE XR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from KOMBIGLYZE XR or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Human Data Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. Animal Data No studies in lactating animals have been conducted with the combined components of KOMBIGLYZE XR. In studies performed with the individual components, both saxagliptin and metformin are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. Saxagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at approximately a 1:1 ratio with plasma drug concentrations. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KOMBIGLYZE XR as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients. Effectiveness of saxagliptin was not demonstrated in a 26-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized clinical trial with a 26-week safety extension (NCT03199053) in 164 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. 8.5 Geriatric Use KOMBIGLYZE XR Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Assess renal function more frequently in the elderly [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Saxagliptin In the seven, double-blind, controlled clinical safety and efficacy trials of saxagliptin, a total of 4751 (42.0%) of the 11301 patients randomized to saxagliptin were 65 years and over, and 1210 (10.7%) were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Metformin HCI Controlled clinical trials of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Saxagliptin In a 12-week randomized placebo-controlled trial, saxagliptin 2.5 mg was administered to 85 patients with moderate (n=48) or severe (n=18) renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n=19) [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo. The overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 20% among patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 22% among patients treated with placebo. Four saxagliptin-treated patients (4.7%) and three placebo-treated patients (3.5%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick glucose \u226450 mg/dL). Metformin HCI Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. KOMBIGLYZE XR is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. KOMBIGLYZE XR is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

No adverse developmental effects were observed in either species at exposures 1503- and 152-times the 5 mg clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively, based on AUC. Saxagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following dosing in pregnant rats. In a prenatal and postnatal development study, no adverse developmental effects were observed in maternal rats administered saxagliptin from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 at exposures up to 470-times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. Metformin HCI Metformin hydrochloride did not cause adverse developmental effect when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2,000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. Saxagliptin and Metformin Saxagliptin and metformin coadministered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not result in adverse developmental effects considered clinically relevant in either species. Doses tested in rats provided exposure up to 100- and 10-times clinical exposure, and doses tested in rabbits provided exposure up to 249- and 1-times clinical exposure relative to the clinical dose of 5 mg saxagliptin and 2,000 mg metformin. Minor skeletal abnormalities associated with maternal toxicity were observed in rats. In rabbits, coadministration was poorly tolerated in a subset of mothers (12 of 30), resulting in death, moribundity, or abortion. However, among surviving mothers with evaluable litters, maternal toxicity was limited to marginal reductions in body weight over the course of gestation days 21 to 29, associated with fetal body weight decrements of 7%, and a low incidence of delayed ossification of the fetal hyoid bone.",

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action KOMBIGLYZE XR KOMBIGLYZE XR contains two antihyperglycemic medications: saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a biguanide. Saxagliptin Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin HCl Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or in healthy subjects except in unusual circumstances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology Saxagliptin In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics KOMBIGLYZE XR Bioequivalence and food effect of KOMBIGLYZE XR was characterized under low calorie diet. The low calorie diet consisted of 324 kcal with meal composition that contained 11.1% protein, 10.5% fat, and 78.4% carbohydrate. The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of saxagliptin (ONGLYZA\uf0d2) and metformin HCl extended-release as individual tablets under fed conditions. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Metformin HCl Metformin extended-release C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. At steady state, the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin extended-release within the range of 500 to 2,000 mg. After repeated administration of metformin extended-release, metformin did not accumulate in plasma. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels of metformin extended-release tablets are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin immediate-release tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar between extended-release tablets and immediate-release tablets. Absorption Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Metformin HCl Following a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Effect of Food Saxagliptin Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin when administered as KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets. Metformin HCl Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin extended-release. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin when administered as KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets. Distribution Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metformin HCl Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins. Elimination Metabolism Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Metformin HCl Intravenous single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Metformin HCl Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Male and Female Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender (males=19, females=16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Racial or Ethnic Groups Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Metformin HCl No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Black or African American (n=51), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (n=24). Patients with Renal Impairment Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Metformin HCl In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with KOMBIGLYZE XR have not been performed, although such studies have been conducted with the individual saxagliptin and metformin components. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action KOMBIGLYZE XR KOMBIGLYZE XR contains two antihyperglycemic medications: saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a biguanide. Saxagliptin Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals. These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose-dependent manner but are inactivated by the DPP4 enzyme within minutes. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, reducing hepatic glucose production. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concentrations of GLP-1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP-1 is preserved. Saxagliptin is a competitive DPP4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones, thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin HCl Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or in healthy subjects except in unusual circumstances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.",

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Saxagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of saxagliptin inhibits DPP4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The rise in insulin and decrease in glucagon were associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. Cardiac Electrophysiology Saxagliptin In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover, active comparator trial using moxifloxacin in 40 healthy subjects, saxagliptin was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval or heart rate at daily doses up to 40 mg (8-times the MRHD).",

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics KOMBIGLYZE XR Bioequivalence and food effect of KOMBIGLYZE XR was characterized under low calorie diet. The low calorie diet consisted of 324 kcal with meal composition that contained 11.1% protein, 10.5% fat, and 78.4% carbohydrate. The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of saxagliptin (ONGLYZA\uf0d2) and metformin HCl extended-release as individual tablets under fed conditions. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Metformin HCl Metformin extended-release C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. At steady state, the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin extended-release within the range of 500 to 2,000 mg. After repeated administration of metformin extended-release, metformin did not accumulate in plasma. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels of metformin extended-release tablets are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin immediate-release tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar between extended-release tablets and immediate-release tablets. Absorption Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Metformin HCl Following a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Effect of Food Saxagliptin Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin when administered as KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets. Metformin HCl Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin extended-release. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin when administered as KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets. Distribution Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metformin HCl Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins. Elimination Metabolism Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Metformin HCl Intravenous single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Metformin HCl Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Male and Female Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender (males=19, females=16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Racial or Ethnic Groups Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Metformin HCl No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Black or African American (n=51), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (n=24). Patients with Renal Impairment Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Metformin HCl In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Drug Interaction Studies Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with KOMBIGLYZE XR have not been performed, although such studies have been conducted with the individual saxagliptin and metformin components. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "KOMBIGLYZE XR Bioequivalence and food effect of KOMBIGLYZE XR was characterized under low calorie diet. The low calorie diet consisted of 324 kcal with meal composition that contained 11.1% protein, 10.5% fat, and 78.4% carbohydrate. The results of bioequivalence studies in healthy subjects demonstrated that KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets are bioequivalent to coadministration of corresponding doses of saxagliptin (ONGLYZA\uf0d2) and metformin HCl extended-release as individual tablets under fed conditions. Saxagliptin The pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The C max and AUC values of saxagliptin and its active metabolite increased proportionally in the 2.5 to 400 mg dose range. Following a 5 mg single oral dose of saxagliptin to healthy subjects, the mean plasma AUC values for saxagliptin and its active metabolite were 78 ng\u2022h/mL and 214 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The corresponding plasma C max values were 24 ng/mL and 47 ng/mL, respectively. The average variability (%CV) for AUC and C max for both saxagliptin and its active metabolite was less than 25%. No appreciable accumulation of either saxagliptin or its active metabolite was observed with repeated once-daily dosing at any dose level. No dose- and time-dependence were observed in the clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite over 14 days of once-daily dosing with saxagliptin at doses ranging from 2.5 to 400 mg. Metformin HCl Metformin extended-release C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. At steady state, the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin extended-release within the range of 500 to 2,000 mg. After repeated administration of metformin extended-release, metformin did not accumulate in plasma. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism. Peak plasma levels of metformin extended-release tablets are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin immediate-release tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar between extended-release tablets and immediate-release tablets. Absorption Saxagliptin The median time to maximum concentration (T max ) following the 5 mg once daily dose was 2 hours for saxagliptin and 4 hours for its active metabolite. Metformin HCl Following a single oral dose of metformin extended-release, C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours. Effect of Food Saxagliptin Administration with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in T max of saxagliptin by approximately 20 minutes as compared to fasted conditions. There was a 27% increase in the AUC of saxagliptin when given with a meal as compared to fasted conditions. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin when administered as KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets. Metformin HCl Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin extended-release tablet increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin extended-release. Food has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin when administered as KOMBIGLYZE XR combination tablets. Distribution Saxagliptin The in vitro protein binding of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in human serum is negligible. Therefore, changes in blood protein levels in various disease states (e.g., renal or hepatic impairment) are not expected to alter the disposition of saxagliptin. Metformin HCl Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins. Elimination Metabolism Saxagliptin The metabolism of saxagliptin is primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). The major metabolite of saxagliptin is also a DPP4 inhibitor, which is one-half as potent as saxagliptin. Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors and inducers will alter the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Metformin HCl Intravenous single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is eliminated by both renal and hepatic pathways. Following a single 50 mg dose of 14 C-saxagliptin, 24%, 36%, and 75% of the dose was excreted in the urine as saxagliptin, its active metabolite, and total radioactivity, respectively. The average renal clearance of saxagliptin (~230 mL/min) was greater than the average estimated glomerular filtration rate (~120 mL/min), suggesting some active renal excretion. A total of 22% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces representing the fraction of the saxagliptin dose excreted in bile and/or unabsorbed drug from the gastrointestinal tract. Following a single oral dose of saxagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects, the mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for saxagliptin and its active metabolite was 2.5 and 3.1 hours, respectively. Metformin HCl Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on age alone. Elderly subjects (65-80 years) had 23% and 59% higher geometric mean C max and geometric mean AUC values, respectively, for saxagliptin than young subjects (18-40 years). Differences in active metabolite pharmacokinetics between elderly and young subjects generally reflected the differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics. The difference between the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and the active metabolite in young and elderly subjects is likely due to multiple factors including declining renal function and metabolic capacity with increasing age. Age was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Male and Female Patients Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender. There were no differences observed in saxagliptin pharmacokinetics between males and females. Compared to males, females had approximately 25% higher exposure values for the active metabolite than males, but this difference is unlikely to be of clinical relevance. Gender was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Metformin HCl Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender (males=19, females=16). Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Racial or Ethnic Groups Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on race. The population pharmacokinetic analysis compared the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite in 309 White subjects with 105 subjects of other races (consisting of six racial groups). No significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin and its active metabolite were detected between these two populations. Metformin HCl No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Black or African American (n=51), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (n=24). Patients with Renal Impairment Saxagliptin A single-dose, open-label trial was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of saxagliptin (10 mg dose) in subjects with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. The 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage. The degree of renal impairment did not affect C max of saxagliptin or its metabolite. In subjects with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and ESRD patient on hemodialysis, the AUC values of saxagliptin or its active metabolite were >2 fold higher than AUC values in subjects with normal renal function. Metformin HCl In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [ see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients with Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Body Mass Index Saxagliptin No dosage adjustment is recommended based on body mass index (BMI) which was not identified as a significant covariate on the apparent clearance of saxagliptin or its active metabolite in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.",
      "Drug Interaction Studies Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with KOMBIGLYZE XR have not been performed, although such studies have been conducted with the individual saxagliptin and metformin components. In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, saxagliptin and its active metabolite did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, or 3A4. Therefore, saxagliptin is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Saxagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, but is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of P-gp.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility KOMBIGLYZE XR No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in KOMBIGLYZE XR to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. The following data are based on studies with saxagliptin and metformin administered individually. Saxagliptin Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity was evaluated in 2-year studies conducted in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice dosed orally at 50, 250, and 600 mg/kg up to 870-times (males) and 1165-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Saxagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in rats dosed orally at 25, 75, 150, and 300 mg/kg up to 355-times (males) and 2217-times (females) the 5 mg/day clinical dose, based on AUC. Mutagenesis Saxagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of genotoxicity tests (Ames bacterial mutagenesis, human and rat lymphocyte cytogenetics, rat bone marrow micronucleus and DNA repair assays). The active metabolite of saxagliptin was not mutagenic in an Ames bacterial assay. Impairment of Fertility Saxagliptin administered to rats had no effect on fertility or the ability to maintain a litter at exposures up to 603-times and 776-times the 5 mg clinical dose in males and females, based on AUC. Metformin HCI Carcinogenesis Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1,500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. Mutagenesis There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test ( S. typhimurium ), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Impairment of Fertility Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Saxagliptin Saxagliptin produced adverse skin changes in the extremities of cynomolgus monkeys (scabs and/or ulceration of tail, digits, scrotum, and/or nose). Skin lesions were reversible within exposure approximately 20-times the 5 mg clinical dose, but in some cases were irreversible and necrotizing at higher exposures. Adverse skin changes were not observed at exposures similar to (1- to 3-times) the 5 mg clinical dose. Clinical correlates to skin lesions in monkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin."

Skin lesions were reversible within exposure approximately 20-times the 5 mg clinical dose, but in some cases were irreversible and necrotizing at higher exposures. Adverse skin changes were not observed at exposures similar to (1- to 3-times) the 5 mg clinical dose. Clinical correlates to skin lesions in monkeys have not been observed in human clinical trials of saxagliptin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Efficacy Trials The effectiveness of KOMBIGLYZE XR has been established in clinical trials of coadministration of oral saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release tablets in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone and in treatment-naive patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise alone. In these two trials, treatment with saxagliptin dosed in the morning plus metformin HCl immediate-release tablets at all doses produced statistically significant improvements in A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) following a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared to control. Reductions in A1C were seen across subgroups including gender, age, race, and baseline BMI. In these two trials, decrease in body weight in the treatment groups given saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl immediate-release was similar to that in the groups given metformin HCl immediate-release alone. Saxagliptin plus metformin HCl immediate-release was not associated with significant changes from baseline in fasting serum lipids compared to metformin HCl alone. The coadministration of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release tablets has also been evaluated in an active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin to glipizide in 858 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, in a placebo-controlled trial where a subgroup of 314 patients inadequately controlled on insulin plus metformin HCl received add-on therapy with saxagliptin or placebo, a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 257 patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea, and a trial comparing saxagliptin to placebo in 315 patients inadequately controlled on dapagliflozin and metformin HCl. In a 24-week, double-blind, randomized trial, patients treated with metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg twice daily for at least 8 weeks were randomized to continued treatment with metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg twice daily or to metformin HCl extended-release either 1,000 mg once daily or 1,500 mg once daily. The mean change in A1C from baseline to Week 24 was 0.1% (95% confidence interval 0%, 0.3%) for the metformin HCl immediate-release treatment arm, 0.3% (95% confidence interval 0.1%, 0.4%) for the 1,000 mg metformin HCl extended-release treatment arm, and 0.1% (95% confidence interval 0%, 0.3%) for the 1,500 mg metformin HCl extended-release treatment arm. Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin HCl immediate-release treatment may be safely switched to metformin HCl extended-release once daily at the same total daily dose, up to 2,000 mg once daily. Following a switch from metformin HCl immediate-release to metformin HCl extended-release, glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly. Saxagliptin Morning and Evening Dosing A 24-week monotherapy trial was conducted to assess a range of dosing regimens for saxagliptin. Treatment-naive patients with inadequately controlled diabetes (A1C \u22657% to \u226410%) underwent a 2-week, single-blind diet, exercise, and placebo lead-in period. A total of 365 patients were randomized to 2.5 mg every morning, 5 mg every morning, 2.5 mg with possible titration to 5 mg every morning, or 5 mg every evening of saxagliptin, or placebo. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with metformin HCI rescue therapy added on to placebo or saxagliptin; the number of patients randomized per treatment group ranged from 71 to 74. Treatment with either saxagliptin 5 mg every morning or 5 mg every evening provided significant improvements in A1C versus placebo (mean placebo-corrected reductions of \u22120.4% and \u22120.3%, respectively). Coadministration of Saxagliptin with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients A total of 1306 treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin coadministered with metformin HCl immediate-release in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22658% to \u226412%) on diet and exercise alone. Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg + placebo (the maximum recommended approved saxagliptin dose is 5 mg daily; the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin does not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose and the 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage). Saxagliptin was dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl immediate-release, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2,000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during this trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl immediate-release provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin HCl immediate-release (Table 7). Table 7: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin Coadministration with Metformin Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial or last observation prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy for patients needing rescue.

To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1,500-2,550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl immediate-release at their pre-trial dose, up to 2500 mg daily, for the duration of the trial. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl immediate-release (the maximum recommended approved saxagliptin dose is 5 mg daily; the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin does not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose and the 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage). Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were not permitted. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release (Table 8). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group, 13% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group.

Figure 1 Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release versus Glipizide Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release In this 52-week, active-controlled trial, a total of 858 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control (A1C >6.5% and \u226410%) on metformin HCl immediate-release alone were randomized to double-blind add-on therapy with saxagliptin or glipizide. Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl immediate-release (at least 1,500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl immediate-release (1,500-3,000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of saxagliptin or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl immediate-release. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl immediate-release group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C <9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p<0.0001). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p<0.0001). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters at Week 52 in an Active-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin versus Glipizide in Combination with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release Intent-to-treat population using last observation on trial. Efficacy Parameter Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCI N=428 Titrated Glipizide + Metformin HCI N=430 Hemoglobin A1C (%) N=423 N=423 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares mean adjusted for baseline value. ) \u22120.6 \u22120.7 Difference from glipizide + metformin HCI (adjusted mean ) 0.1 95% Confidence Interval (\u22120.02, 0.2) Saxagliptin + metformin HCI is considered non-inferior to glipizide + metformin because the upper limit of this confidence interval is less than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.35%.

Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin Immediate-Release) A total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with insulin in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657.5% and \u226411%) on insulin alone (N=141) or on insulin in combination with a stable dose of metformin immediate-release (N=314). Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u226530 units to \u2264150 units daily) with \u226420% variation in total daily dose for \u22658 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin immediate-release if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by >20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin immediate-release (\u22120.4% and \u22120.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the saxagliptin group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the saxagliptin 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C <7% was 17% (52/300) with saxagliptin in combination with insulin compared to 7% (10/149) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1,500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u226550% of the maximum recommended dose) for \uf0b38 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group. Table 11: Glycemic Parameters at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI plus Sulfonylurea Intent-to-treat population using last observation prior to discontinuation.

The percent of patients achieving an A1C <7% was 31% (39/127) with saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCI plus a sulfonylurea compared to 9% (12/127) with placebo. Significance was not tested. Saxagliptin Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24 week randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u22657% to \u226410.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead in treatment period, which included 16 weeks of open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to saxagliptin 5 mg (N=153) or placebo (N =162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCI There were 6.5% (n=10) of randomized patients in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n=5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at week 24. Of the patients who discontinued trial medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at week 24.

(\u22120.5, \u22120.2) The known proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% at Week 24 was 35.3% in the saxagliptin-treated group compared to 23.1% in the placebo-treated group. 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Trial The cardiovascular risk of saxagliptin was evaluated in SAVOR, a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing saxagliptin (N=8280) to placebo (N=8212), both administered in combination with standard of care, in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Of the randomized trial patients, 97.5% completed the trial, and the median duration of follow-up was approximately 2 years. The trial was event-driven, and patients were followed until a sufficient number of events were accrued. Patients were at least 40 years of age, had A1C \u22656.5%, and multiple risk factors (21% of randomized patients) for cardiovascular disease (age \u226555 years for men and \u226560 years for women plus at least one additional risk factor of dyslipidemia, hypertension, or current cigarette smoking) or established (79% of the randomized patients) cardiovascular disease defined as a history of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or ischemic stroke. The majority of patients were male (67%) and White (75%) with a mean age of 65 years. Approximately 16% of the population had moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] \u226530 to \u226450 mL/min) to severe (eGFR <30 mL/min) renal impairment, and 13% had a prior history of heart failure. Patients had a median duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus of approximately 10 years, and a mean baseline A1C level of 8.0%. Approximately 5% of patients were treated with diet and exercise only at baseline. Overall, the use of diabetes medications was balanced across treatment groups (metformin 69%, insulin 41%, sulfonylureas 40%, and TZDs 6%). The use of cardiovascular disease medications was also balanced (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] 79%, statins 78%, aspirin 75%, beta-blockers 62%, and non-aspirin antiplatelet medications 24%). The primary analysis in SAVOR was time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiac event in SAVOR was defined as a cardiovascular death, or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal ischemic stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE, and was also powered for a superiority comparison if non-inferiority was demonstrated. The results of SAVOR, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint are shown in Table 13. The incidence rate of MACE was similar in both treatment arms: 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on placebo vs. 3.8 MACE per 100 patient-years on saxagliptin. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with saxagliptin relative to placebo was 1.00 with a 95.1% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.12). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.12, excluded a risk margin larger than 1.3. Table 13: Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) by Treatment Group in the SAVOR Trial Saxagliptin Placebo Hazard Ratio Number of Patients (%) Rate per 100 PY Number of Patients (%) Rate per 100 PY (95.1% CI) Composite of first event of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal ischemic stroke (MACE) N=8280 Total PY = 16308.8 N=8212 Total PY = 16156.0 613 (7.4) 3.8 609 (7.4) 3.8 1.00 (0.89, 1.12) CV death 245 (3.0) 1.5 234 (2.8) 1.4 Non-fatal MI 233 (2.8) 1.4 260 (3.2) 1.6 Non-fatal ischemic stroke 135 (1.6) 0.8 115 (1.4) 0.7 The Kaplan-Meier-based cumulative event probability is presented in Figure 2 for time to first occurrence of the primary MACE composite endpoint by treatment arm. The curves for both saxagliptin and placebo arms are close together throughout the duration of the trial. The estimated cumulative event probability is approximately linear for both arms, indicating that the incidence of MACE for both arms was constant over the trial duration. Vital status was obtained for 99% of patients in the trial. There were 798 deaths in the SAVOR trial. Numerically more patients (5.1%) died in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group (4.6%). The risk of deaths from all cause (Table 14) was not statistically different between the treatment groups (HR: 1.11; 95.1% CI: 0.96, 1.27).

      "Coadministration of Saxagliptin with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients A total of 1306 treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin coadministered with metformin HCl immediate-release in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22658% to \u226412%) on diet and exercise alone. Patients were required to be treatment-naive to be enrolled in this trial. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 1-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period. Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms: saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg, saxagliptin 10 mg + placebo, or metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg + placebo (the maximum recommended approved saxagliptin dose is 5 mg daily; the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin does not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose and the 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage). Saxagliptin was dosed once daily. In the 3 treatment groups using metformin HCl immediate-release, the metformin HCl dose was up-titrated weekly in 500 mg per day increments, as tolerated, to a maximum of 2,000 mg per day based on FPG. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during this trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue as add-on therapy. Coadministration of saxagliptin 5 mg plus metformin HCl immediate-release provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo plus metformin HCl immediate-release (Table 7).

      "Addition of Saxagliptin to Metformin HCI Immediate-Release A total of 743 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl immediate-release in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%) on metformin HCl alone. To qualify for enrollment, patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (1,500-2,550 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl immediate-release at their pre-trial dose, up to 2500 mg daily, for the duration of the trial. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg of saxagliptin or placebo in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl immediate-release (the maximum recommended approved saxagliptin dose is 5 mg daily; the 10 mg daily dose of saxagliptin does not provide greater efficacy than the 5 mg daily dose and the 10 mg dosage is not an approved dosage). Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue therapy, added on to existing trial medications. Dose titrations of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were not permitted. Saxagliptin 2.5 mg and 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and PPG compared with placebo add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release (Table 8). Mean changes from baseline for A1C over time and at endpoint are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued for meeting prespecified glycemic criteria was 15% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group, 13% in the saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group, and 27% in the placebo add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release group.

      "Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release versus Glipizide Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI Immediate-Release In this 52-week, active-controlled trial, a total of 858 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control (A1C >6.5% and \u226410%) on metformin HCl immediate-release alone were randomized to double-blind add-on therapy with saxagliptin or glipizide. Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl immediate-release (at least 1,500 mg daily) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, 2-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received metformin HCl immediate-release (1,500-3,000 mg based on their pre-trial dose). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to 5 mg of saxagliptin or 5 mg of glipizide in addition to their current dose of open-label metformin HCl immediate-release. Patients in the glipizide plus metformin HCl immediate-release group underwent blinded titration of the glipizide dose during the first 18 weeks of the trial up to a maximum glipizide dose of 20 mg per day. Titration was based on a goal FPG \u2264110 mg/dL or the highest tolerable glipizide dose. Fifty percent (50%) of the glipizide-treated patients were titrated to the 20-mg daily dose; 21% of the glipizide-treated patients had a final daily glipizide dose of 5 mg or less. The mean final daily dose of glipizide was 15 mg. After 52 weeks of treatment, saxagliptin and glipizide resulted in similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C when added to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy (Table 9). This conclusion may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those in the trial (91% of patients had baseline A1C <9%). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p<0.0001). From a baseline mean body weight of 89 kg, there was a statistically significant mean reduction of 1.1 kg in patients treated with saxagliptin compared to a mean weight gain of 1.1 kg in patients treated with glipizide (p<0.0001).

      "Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin Immediate-Release) A total of 455 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with insulin in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657.5% and \u226411%) on insulin alone (N=141) or on insulin in combination with a stable dose of metformin immediate-release (N=314). Patients were required to be on a stable dose of insulin (\u226530 units to \u2264150 units daily) with \u226420% variation in total daily dose for \u22658 weeks prior to screening. Patients entered the trial on intermediate- or long-acting (basal) insulin or premixed insulin. Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a premixed insulin. Patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled in a single-blind, four-week, dietary and exercise placebo lead-in period during which patients received insulin (and metformin immediate-release if applicable) at their pretrial dose(s). Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to add-on therapy with either saxagliptin 5 mg or placebo. Doses of the antidiabetic therapies were to remain stable but patients were rescued and allowed to adjust the insulin regimen if specific glycemic goals were not met or if the investigator learned that the patient had self-increased the insulin dose by >20%. Data after rescue were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses. Add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg provided significant improvements from baseline to Week 24 in A1C and PPG compared with add-on placebo (Table 10). Similar mean reductions in A1C versus placebo were observed for patients using saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin alone and saxagliptin 5 mg add-on to insulin in combination with metformin immediate-release (\u22120.4% and \u22120.4%, respectively). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control or who were rescued was 23% in the saxagliptin group and 32% in the placebo group. The mean daily insulin dose at baseline was 53 units in patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg and 55 units in patients treated with placebo. The mean change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was 2 units for the saxagliptin 5 mg group and 5 units for the placebo group.

      "Saxagliptin Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCI plus Sulfonylurea A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea in patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% and \u226410%). Patients were to be on a stable combined dose of metformin HCl extended-release or immediate-release (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being 1,500 mg) and a sulfonylurea (at maximum tolerated dose, with minimum dose for enrollment being \u226550% of the maximum recommended dose) for \uf0b38 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients who met eligibility criteria were entered in a 2-week enrollment period to allow assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following the 2-week enrollment period, eligible patients were randomized to either double-blind saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) or double-blind matching placebo for 24 weeks. During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, patients were to receive metformin HCl and a sulfonylurea at the same constant dose ascertained during enrollment. Sulfonylurea dose could be down titrated once in the case of a major hypoglycemic event or recurring minor hypoglycemic events. In the absence of hypoglycemia, titration (up or down) of trial medication during the treatment period was prohibited. Saxagliptin in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea provided significant improvements in A1C and PPG compared with placebo in combination with metformin HCl plus a sulfonylurea (Table 11). The percentage of patients who discontinued for lack of glycemic control was 6% in the saxagliptin group and 5% in the placebo group.

Saxagliptin Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin plus an SGLT2 Inhibitor A total of 315 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in this 24 week randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) and metformin HCl in patients with a baseline of HbA1c \u22657% to \u226410.5%. The mean age of these patients was 54.6 years, 1.6% were 75 years or older and 52.7% were female. The population was 87.9% White, 6.3% Black or African American, 4.1% Asian, and 1.6% other races. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.7 years and a mean HbA1c of 7.9%. The mean eGFR at baseline was 93.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were required to be on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651,500 mg per day) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Eligible patients who completed the screening period entered the lead in treatment period, which included 16 weeks of open-label metformin HCl and 10 mg dapagliflozin treatment. Following the lead-in period, eligible patients were randomized to saxagliptin 5 mg (N=153) or placebo (N =162). The group treated with add-on saxagliptin had statistically significant greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline versus the group treated with placebo (see Table 12). Table 12: HbA1c Change from Baseline at Week 24 in a Placebo-Controlled Trial of Saxagliptin as Add-On to Dapagliflozin and Metformin HCI There were 6.5% (n=10) of randomized patients in the saxagliptin arm and 3.1% (n=5) in the placebo arm for whom change from baseline HbA1c data was missing at week 24. Of the patients who discontinued trial medication early, 9.1% (1 of 11) in the saxagliptin arm and 16.7% (1 of 6) in the placebo arm had HbA1c measured at week 24.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Lactic Acidosis The risks of lactic acidosis due to the metformin component, its symptoms and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR immediately and to promptly notify their health care provider if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence, dizziness, slow or irregular heartbeat, sensation of feeling cold (especially in the extremities), or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common during initiation of metformin treatment and may occur during initiation of KOMBIGLYZE XR therapy; however, patients should consult their physician if they develop unexplained symptoms. Although gastrointestinal symptoms that occur after stabilization are unlikely to be drug related, such an occurrence of symptoms should be evaluated to determine if it may be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Patients should be counseled against excessive alcohol intake while receiving KOMBIGLYZE XR. Patients should be informed about the importance of regular testing of renal function and hematological parameters when receiving treatment with KOMBIGLYZE XR. Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking KOMBIGLYZE XR prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of KOMBIGLYZE XR may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Pancreatitis Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during post-marketing use of saxagliptin. Educate patients that persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue KOMBIGLYZE XR and contact their health care provider if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Heart Failure Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Before initiating KOMBIGLYZE XR, ask patients if they have a history of heart failure or other risk factors for heart failure including moderate to severe renal impairment. Instruct patients to contact their health care provider as soon as possible if they experience symptoms of heart failure, including increasing shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or swelling of the feet [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Inform patients that hypoglycemia can occur, particularly when insulin or an insulin secretagogue is used in combination with KOMBIGLYZE XR. Educate patients about the risks, symptoms and appropriate management of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients should be informed that serious allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions, such as angioedema, anaphylaxis, and exfoliative skin conditions, have been reported during post-marketing use of saxagliptin. If symptoms of these allergic reactions (such as rash, skin flaking or peeling, urticaria, swelling of the skin, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing) occur, patients must stop taking KOMBIGLYZE XR and seek medical advice promptly [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Severe and Disabling Arthralgia Inform patients that severe and disabling joint pain may occur with this class of drugs. The time to onset of symptoms can range from one day to years. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if severe joint pain occurs [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Bullous Pemphigoid Inform patients that bullous pemphigoid may occur with this class of drugs. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if blisters or erosions occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Administration Instructions Patients should be informed that KOMBIGLYZE XR must be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed, and that the inactive ingredients may occasionally be eliminated in the feces as a soft mass that may resemble the original tablet. Missed Dose If a dose is missed, advise patients to take KOMBIGLYZE XR as soon as they remember unless it is time for their next dose Instruct patients not to take two doses of KOMBLIGLYZE XR at the same time.
