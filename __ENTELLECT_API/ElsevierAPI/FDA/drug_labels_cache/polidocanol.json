    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous use only. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter is seen or if the contents of the vial are discolored or if the vial is damaged in any way. For spider veins (varicose veins \u22641 mm in diameter), use Asclera 0.5%. For reticular veins (varicose veins 1 to 3 mm in diameter), use Asclera 1%. Use 0.1 to 0.3 mL per injection and no more than 10 mL per session. Use a syringe (glass or plastic) with a fine needle (typically, 26- or 30-gauge). Insert the needle tangentially into the vein and inject the solution slowly while the needle is still in the vein. Apply only gentle pressure during injection to prevent vein rupture. After the needle has been removed and the injection site has been covered, apply compression in the form of a stocking or bandage. After the treatment session, encourage the patient to walk for 15 to 20 minutes. Keep the patient under observation to detect any anaphylactic or allergic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Maintain compression for 2 to 3 days after treatment of spider veins and for 5 to 7 days for reticular veins. For extensive varicosities, longer compression treatment with compression bandages or a gradient compression stocking of a higher compression class is recommended. Post-treatment compression is necessary to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis. Repeat treatments may be necessary if the extent of the varicose veins requires more than 10 mL. These treatments should be separated by 1 to 2 weeks. Small intravaricose thrombi that develop may be removed by microthrombectomy. For intravenous use only. Solution strength and the volume injected depend on the size and extent of the varicose veins. Extensive varicosities may require multiple treatment sessions. ( 2 ) Spider veins (varicose veins \u22641 mm in diameter): Use Asclera 0.5%. ( 2 ) Reticular veins (varicose veins 1 to 3 mm in diameter): Use Asclera 1%. ( 2 ) Use 0.1 to 0.3 mL for each injection into each varicose vein. The maximum recommended volume per treatment session is 10 mL. ( 2 )"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis. ( 5.1 ) Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism. ( 5.2 ) Arterial Embolism. ( 5.3 ) Tissue ischemia and necrosis: Do not inject intra-arterially. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Anaphylaxis Severe allergic reactions have been reported following polidocanol use, including anaphylactic reactions, some of them fatal. Severe reactions are more frequent with use of larger volumes (> 3 mL). Minimize the dose of polidocanol. Be prepared to treat anaphylaxis appropriately. Severe adverse local effects, including tissue necrosis, may occur following extravasation; therefore, take care in intravenous needle placement and use the smallest effective volume at each injection. After the injection session is completed, apply compression with a stocking or bandage, and have the patient walk for 15-20 minutes. Keep the patient under supervision during this period to treat any anaphylactic or allergic reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 5.2 Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Asclera can cause venous thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism or other thrombotic events. Follow administration instructions closely and monitor for signs of venous thrombosis after treatment. Patients with reduced mobility, history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or recent (within 3 months) major surgery, prolonged hospitalization or pregnancy are at increased risk for developing thrombosis. 5.3 Arterial Embolism Stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, and impaired cardiac function have been reported in close temporal relationship with polidocanol administration. These events may be caused by air embolism when using the product foamed with room air (high nitrogen concentration) or thromboembolism. The safety and efficacy of polidocanol foamed with room air has not been established and its use should be avoided. 5.4 Tissue Ischemia and Necrosis Intra-arterial injection or extravasation of polidocanol can cause severe necrosis, ischemia or gangrene. Take care in intravenous needle placement and use the smallest effective volume at each injection site. After the injection session is completed, apply compression with a stocking or bandage and have patients walk for 15-20 minutes. If intra-arterial injection of polidocanol occurs, consult a vascular surgeon immediately."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions occurring at least 3% more frequently than on placebo are mild local reactions at the site of injection. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Methapharm at 1-866-701-4636 or medinfo@methapharm.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Study Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In 5 controlled randomized clinical trials, Asclera has been administered to 401 patients with small or very small varicose veins (reticular and spider veins) and compared with another sclerosing agent and with placebo. Patients were 18 to 70 years old. The patient population was predominately female and consisted of Caucasian and Asian patients. Table 1 shows adverse events more common with Asclera or sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) 1% than with placebo by at least 3% in the placebo-controlled EASI study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . All of these were injection site reactions and most were mild.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and without a control group, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria generalized, asthma Nervous system disorders: Cerebrovascular accident, migraine, paresthesia (local), loss of consciousness, confusional state, dizziness Cardiac disorders: Cardiac arrest, palpitations Vascular disorders: Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, syncope vasovagal, circulatory collapse, vasculitis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Skin hyperpigmentation, dermatitis allergic, hypertrichosis (in the area of sclerotherapy) General disorders and injection site conditions : Injection site necrosis, pyrexia, hot flush Injury, poisoning and procedural complications : Nerve injury"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The available data from case reports on use of polidocanol-containing products, including ASCLERA, in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Although none of these risks have been identified, there is minimal benefit in treating uncomplicated spider veins and reticular veins in the lower extremity during pregnancy and lower extremity varicosities that develop during pregnancy as they may spontaneously regress postpartum. The animal reproduction studies were conducted in a manner to achieve systemic exposure, while the intended clinical use is local exposure at the injection site with minimal to no systemic exposure; therefore, these data are not relevant to the intended clinical use (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Developmental reproductive toxicity testing was performed in rats and rabbits with intravenous administration. Polidocanol induced maternal and fetal toxicity in rabbits, including reduced mean fetal weight and reduced fetal survival, when administered during gestation days 6-20 at doses of 4 and 10 mg/kg, but it did not cause skeletal or visceral abnormalities. No adverse maternal or fetal effects were observed in rabbits at a dose of 2 mg/kg. No evidence of teratogenicity or fetal toxicity was observed in rats dosed during gestation days 6-17 with doses up to 10 mg/kg. Polidocanol did not affect the ability of rats to deliver and rear pups when administered intermittently by intravenous injection from gestation day 17 to post-partum day 21 at doses up to 10 mg/kg. These studies were conducted in a manner to achieve systemic exposure, while the intended clinical use is local exposure at the injection site with minimal to no systemic exposure; therefore, these data are not relevant to the intended clinical use. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of polidocanol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk up to 8 hours after ASCLERA administration in order to minimize exposure to a breastfed infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Asclera in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Asclera did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The active ingredient of Asclera is polidocanol. Polidocanol is a sclerosing agent that locally damages the endothelium of blood vessels. When injected intravenously, polidocanol induces endothelial damage. Platelets then aggregate at the site of damage and attach to the venous wall. Eventually, a dense network of platelets, cellular debris, and fibrin occludes the vessel. Finally, the occluded vein is replaced with connective fibrous tissue. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Polidocanol has a concentration- and volume-dependent damaging effect on the endothelium of blood vessels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics During the major effectiveness study (EASI-trial), scheduled blood samples were taken from a sub-group of 22 patients to measure plasma levels of polidocanol after Asclera treatment of spider and reticular veins. Low systemic blood levels of polidocanol were seen in some patients. The mean t 1/2 of polidocanol in 4 patients with evaluable data receiving 4.5 -18.0 mg was 1.5 h."

A total of 338 patients were treated with Asclera [0.5% for spider veins (n=94), 1% for reticular veins (n=86)], sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) 1% (n=105), or placebo (0.9% isotonic saline solution) (n=53) for either spider or reticular veins. Patients were predominately female, ranging in age from 19 to 70 years. All of them received an intravenous injection in the first treatment session; repeat injections were given three and six weeks later if the previous injection was evaluated as unsuccessful (defined as 1, 2 or 3 on a 5-point scale, see below). Patients returned at 12 and 26 weeks after the last injection for final assessments. The primary effectiveness endpoint was improvement of veins judged by a blinded panel. Digital images of the selected treatment area were taken prior to injection, compared with those taken at 12 weeks post-treatment, and rated on a 5-point scale (1 = worse than before, 2 = same as before, 3 = moderate improvement, 4 = good improvement, 5 = complete treatment success); results are shown in Table 2.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intravenous use only. VARITHENA is intended for intravenous injection using ultrasound guidance, administered via a single cannula into the lumen of the target incompetent trunk veins or by direct injection into varicosities. Use up to 5 mL per injection and no more than 15 mL per session. Physicians administering VARITHENA must be experienced with venous procedures and be trained in the administration of VARITHENA. Activate VARITHENA using the VARITHENA oxygen canister and polidocanol canister ( see Instructions for Use ). Once a VARITHENA transfer unit is in place, foam can be generated and transferred to a syringe. Discard the syringe contents if there are any visible bubbles. Administer the injectable foam within 75 seconds of extraction from the canister to maintain injectable foam properties. Use a new sterile syringe after each injection. Use a new VARITHENA transfer unit for each treatment session. Local anesthetic may be administered prior to cannula insertion but neither tumescent anesthesia nor patient sedation is required. Cannulate the vein to be treated using ultrasound guidance to confirm venous access. Inject freshly generated VARITHENA injectable foam slowly (approximately 1 mL/second in the GSV and 0.5 mL/second in accessory veins or varicosities) while monitoring using ultrasound. Confirm venospasm of the treated vein using ultrasound. When treating the proximal GSV, stop the injection when VARITHENA is 3-5 cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). Apply compression bandaging and stockings and have the patient walk for at least 10 minutes, while being monitored. Maintain compression for 2 weeks after treatment. Repeat treatment may be necessary if the size and extent of the veins to be treated require more than 15 mL of VARITHENA. Separate treatment sessions by a minimum of 5 days. Retained coagulum may be removed by aspiration (microthrombectomy) to improve comfort and reduce skin staining. Incompetent great saphenous or accessory saphenous veins: Use Varithena 1% (CEAP Class 2-6 Disease). ( 2 ). For intravenous use which should be performed under ultrasound guidance when treating the GSV. Use up to 5 mL per injection and 15 mL per treatment session. ( 2 ) Separate treatment sessions by a minimum of 5 days. ( 2 )"

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials, the most common related adverse events (occurring in \u22653% of patients treated with VARITHENA) were pain/discomfort in extremity, infusion site thrombosis (retained coagulum), injection site hematoma or pain, thrombophlebitis superficial, and extravasation.( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocompatibles, Inc. at 1-855-971-VEIN (1-855-971-8346) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under controlled but widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of VARITHENA cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of other drugs or procedures and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 1333 patients with GSVI in 12 clinical trials were evaluated for safety when treated with VARITHENA at dose concentrations of 0.125%, 0.5%, 1.0%, or 2.0%, including 437 patients treated with VARITHENA in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Adverse reactions occurring in 3% more patients receiving VARITHENA 1% than receiving placebo are shown in Table 1 . a Retained coagulum. b Common femoral vein thrombus extension (non-occlusive thrombi starting in the superficial vein and extending into the common femoral vein). Table 1: Treatment-emergent adverse reactions (3% more on VARITHENA 1% than on placebo) through Week 8 (n=588) Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=151) VARITHENA 1.0% (N=149) Pain in extremity 14 (9.3) 25 (16.8) Infusion site thrombosis b 0 24 (16.1) Contusion/injection site hematoma 9 (6.0) 23 (15.4) Limb discomfort 5 (3.3) 18 (12.1) Tenderness/injection site pain 5 (3.3) 16 (10.7) Venous thrombosis limb c 0 12 (8.1) Thrombophlebitis superficial 2 (1.3) 8 (5.4) Deep vein thrombosis 0 7 (4.7) In VARITHENA-treated patients, 80% of pain events in the treated extremity resolved within 1 week. Proximal symptomatic venous thrombi occurred in <1% of patients treated with VARITHENA. Approximately half of patients with thrombi received treatment with anticoagulants. Since VARITHENA induces thrombosis in the treated superficial veins, D-dimer is commonly elevated post-treatment and is not useful diagnostically to assess patients for venous thrombus following treatment with VARITHENA. Neurologic adverse events (cerebrovascular accident, migraines) have been reported in patients following administration of physician compounded foam sclerosants. None of the 1333 patients in the VARITHENA trials experienced clinically important neurological or visual adverse events suggestive of cerebral gas embolism. The incidence of neurologic and visual adverse events within 1 day of treatment in the placebo-controlled studies was 2.7% in the pooled VARITHENA group and 4.0% in the placebo groups. Skin discoloration adverse events were reported in 1.1% of the pooled VARITHENA group and 0.7% of the placebo group in the placebo-controlled studies."

In rabbits, dose levels up to and including 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the proposed maximum human dose of 15 mL of 1% VARITHENA based on body surface area) did not produce any indication of adverse effects on embryo-fetal mortality, fetal weight, or the incidences of fetal abnormalities and variants. In rats administered 27 mg/kg/day of polidocanol solution (approximately 13.5 times the human dose based on body surface area), there were no adverse effects on pregnancy performance or fetal development. In a peri-natal and post-natal study in rats, dose levels of polidocanol up to 9 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.5 times the human dose based on body surface area) were without effects on the development of the conceptus and offspring, and at a dose level of 27 mg/kg/day of polidocanol solution (approximately 13.5 times the human dose based on body surface area), effects were confined to an equivocal reduction in body weights of first-generation males, and an associated equivocal delay in the age of preputial separation. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of polidocanol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping anddiscarding breast milk up to 8 hours after VARITHENA administration in order to minimize exposure to a breastfed infant. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1333 subjects in clinical studies treated with VARITHENA, 9.1% (n=121) were \u226565 years of age.

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION VARITHENA injectable foam contains the sclerosant, polidocanol. It is intended for intravenous use only. Chemically, polidocanol is polyoxyl lauryl ether. The structural formula is represented below: Polidocanol has the molecular formula CH 3 (CH 2 ) 11 (OCH 2 CH 2 ) n OH and a molecular weight of 582.9 when the average ethylene glycol moieties is nine (n=9). Polidocanol is a white to almost white, waxy, hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and alcohol and melts at temperatures above 20\u00b0C. VARITHENA is a sterile, injectable foam of an aqueous polidocanol solution (1%) containing the following inactive ingredients: alcohol (4.2% w/w, purity 96% v/v) disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (0.24% w/w), and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.085% w/w) with a pH of 6.0-7.5. The injectable foam is generated after activation of the polidocanol canister with oxygen from a second aluminum canister, resulting in a final gas mixture of oxygen:carbon dioxide in a ratio of 65:35 with low (<0.8%) nitrogen content. At the time of use, VARITHENA is generated as an injectable foam of controlled density and bubble size. The foam is then transferred to a syringe through the VARITHENA transfer unit. The injectable foam has a liquid to gas ratio of approximately 1:7 by volume. The median bubble diameter is less than 100 \u00b5m and no bubbles are greater than 500 \u00b5m. polidocanol Structural Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action VARITHENA is a drug/device combination product that generates injectable foam. The injectable foam is composed of a liquid and gas phase, both of which are necessary to have its therapeutic effect. VARITHENA is intended to act as follows: (1) the foam displaces blood from the vein to be treated, and (2) the polidocanol then scleroses the endothelium. The active pharmaceutical ingredient of VARITHENA is polidocanol, a non-ionic surfactant sclerosing agent. The hydrophobic pole of the polidocanol molecule attaches to the lipid cell membrane of the venous endothelium, resulting in disruption of the osmotic barrier, destruction of the venous endothelium, and vasospasm. Following exposure to polidocanol, the interior surface of the vein becomes thrombogenic, which leads to thrombus formation and venous occlusion. The occluded vein is eventually replaced by fibrous connective tissue. Polidocanol is deactivated upon contact with blood, thus limiting the sclerosant action to the endothelium near the site of injection. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The active pharmaceutical ingredient in VARITHENA is polidocanol. Polidocanol damages the endothelium of blood vessels. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of VARITHENA (as a weighted sum of 4 oligomers: E5, E9, E12 and E14) were evaluated at two concentrations (1% and 2%) randomly assigned within gender in 20 patients with GSV incompetence. When administered as an intravenous injectable foam as two fixed 5 mL doses separated by 10 minutes, polidocanol was rapidly detected in plasma, reaching maximum concentration of drug in the body after dosing (C max ) within 15 minutes of the first injection and within 5 minutes of receiving the second injection of VARITHENA 1% or VARITHENA 2%. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of polidocanol ranged from 35 to 82 L. Mean systemic clearance (CL) of polidocanol ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 L/min. The clearance of E5 was significantly greater than that of longer oligomers. Mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) ranged from 102 to 153 minutes, with most plasma samples below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) at the end of the 8-hour collection period. The increase in plasma polidocanol concentrations was less than proportional with increasing VARITHENA concentration. Weight-normalized data demonstrated no consistent differences in C max or AUC between males and females."

When administered as an intravenous injectable foam as two fixed 5 mL doses separated by 10 minutes, polidocanol was rapidly detected in plasma, reaching maximum concentration of drug in the body after dosing (C max ) within 15 minutes of the first injection and within 5 minutes of receiving the second injection of VARITHENA 1% or VARITHENA 2%. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of polidocanol ranged from 35 to 82 L. Mean systemic clearance (CL) of polidocanol ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 L/min. The clearance of E5 was significantly greater than that of longer oligomers. Mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) ranged from 102 to 153 minutes, with most plasma samples below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) at the end of the 8-hour collection period. The increase in plasma polidocanol concentrations was less than proportional with increasing VARITHENA concentration. Weight-normalized data demonstrated no consistent differences in C max or AUC between males and females."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of VARITHENA. No mutagenic activity was observed in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay at non-toxic concentrations. No mutagenic activity was observed in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of S9 mix and was weakly mutagenic in the presence of S9 close to the limit of acceptance for the accompanying level of toxicity. No micronucleus induction was detected in the in vivo assay on mouse bone marrow cells up to the maximum tolerated dose of 80 mg/kg. There was no adverse effect on fertility in both male and female rats at 27 mg/kg/day. This dose level is approximately 13.5 times the proposed maximum human dose based on body surface area. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The pharmacological effects of polidocanol solution on the renal function of the rat were evaluated and at the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg) hematuria occurred in 67% of animals. This dose is 5 times higher than the proposed maximum human dose based on body surface area. Blood was no longer detectable in urine 24 hours after dosing. In the 28-day repeated dose toxicity study in rat blood, pigments were noted in the urine for animals in all treatment groups, including male controls, at the end of the 4-week treatment period with up to 27 mg polidocanol/kg/day. Following the 2-week recovery period, there was still evidence that blood pigments were present in the urine but the incidence and severity was decreased when compared to the main study animals. There were no histopathological findings in the urinary bladder in any study animals. In a cardiovascular pharmacology study in the anesthetized dog at 20 mg/kg (approximately 33 times the human dose based on body surface area), statistically significantly higher values for P-Q interval were measured before and during dosing and at all time points up to 30 minutes after dosing. An increase in QRS interval was also measured after dosing of 20 mg/kg and at 5 and 10 minutes after dosing. This effect was short lived and was no longer seen at 15 minutes after dosing. In addition, there was an increase in diastolic pressure with increasing dose of polidocanol. This increase became significantly greater (p<0.05) than baseline before injection of the final and highest dose (20 mg/kg). In a further cardiovascular pharmacology study conducted with a once weekly, for four weeks, intravenous bolus injection of VARITHENA in the conscious dog, dose levels of up to 8.0 mL/kg (approximately 17 times the human dose based on body surface area) to beagle dogs caused only a transient, but consistent, effect on respiration, evidenced by a decrease in tidal volume and RMV at 15 minutes post-dose, resolving by one hour post-dose. Histopathology of the lung at the end of the 3-month follow-up period showed no abnormalities."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES VARITHENA was evaluated in two randomized, blinded, multicenter clinical trials designed to assess the efficacy and safety of VARITHENA 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% (VANISH-1) and VARITHENA 0.5% and 1.0% (VANISH-2) compared with placebo in the treatment of both symptoms and appearance in patients with SFJ incompetence as evidenced by reflux of the GSV or major accessory veins. In both studies, a VARITHENA 0.125% treatment group was included as a control for blinding of the duplex ultrasound assessment. Patients with history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; inability to comply with post-treatment compression due to severe peripheral arterial disease or leg obesity; incompetence of the small saphenous vein or deep venous reflux as a major source of reflux; or reduced mobility, major surgery, pregnancy, or prolonged hospitalization within 3 months were excluded. Patients were randomized in an equal distribution to each treatment group; the primary time point for analyses of the primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy endpoints was Week 8. In these clinical trials, the maximum volume of injectable foam or placebo to be administered per treatment session was 15 mL. In VANISH-1, patients received one blinded treatment and in VANISH-2, patients received one blinded treatment with an option for a second blinded treatment 1 week later. In VANISH-2, patients in the VARITHENA 1.0% treatment group received an average of 1.4 blinded treatments. All patients received post-procedure compression therapy for 14 days following treatment. Of the 519 patients randomized into VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, a total of 511 were treated with either VARITHENA 0.5% (n=111), 1.0% (n=110), or 2.0% (n=63), VARITHENA 0.125% as control (n=114), or placebo (n=113). Ninety-nine percent of the patients in VANISH-1 and VANISH-2 completed the blinded treatment period. In the VARITHENA 1% group in VANISH-2, 23 of 58 patients received an additional blinded treatment. Two of these patients had retreatment of veins treated in the initial treatment session. The remaining 21 patients received treatment for additional veins not treated in the initial treatment session. The mean age was approximately 50 years and approximately three-fourths of the patients were women. The mean BMI was similar in VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, at 28 kg/m 2 (range 16 to 44 kg/m 2 ) and 30 kg/m 2 (range 17 to 48 kg/m 2 ), respectively. The mean baseline GSV diameter was also similar in VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, at 7.6 mm (range 1.5 to 25.9 mm) and 8.7 mm (range 3.1 to 19.4 mm), respectively. Overall, 22% of patients in VANISH-1 and 25% of patients in VANISH-2 reported one or more prior varicose vein procedures in the leg to be treated. For both clinical trials, the primary efficacy endpoint was improvement in patient symptoms, as measured by the change from baseline to Week 8 in the 7-day average electronic daily diary VVSymQ \u00ae score. The VVSymQ \u00ae score is a patient-reported outcome measure based on daily patient assessment of the varicose vein symptoms determined to be most important to patients: heaviness, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching. VVSymQ \u00ae scores range from 0 to 25, where 0 represents no symptoms and 25 represents all 5 symptoms experienced all of the time. Results are shown in Table 2 . For both VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, treatment with 1.0% was superior to placebo in improving symptoms as measured by VVSymQ \u00ae , when either a duration or an intensity scale was used to measure patients\u2019 symptoms. *Percent of patients who reported their symptoms had \"moderately improved\" or \"much improved\" compared with baseline.

VCSS is a clinician rating of severity of chronic venous insufficiency ranging from 0 to 30, where higher scores indicate more severe venous disease. In VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in VCSS in the 1% VARITHENA treatment groups were 3.70 and 5.05, respectively, at Week 8 compared with 0.75 and 1.52 points in the placebo groups, respectively. For both studies, the differences between these improvements are statistically significant ( P <0.0001). The physiological response to treatment as measured by duplex ultrasound (duplex response) was defined as elimination of reflux through the SFJ and/or complete occlusion of all incompetent GSV and major accessory veins at baseline. The primary comparison for duplex response in both studies was the pooled VARITHENA groups versus the VARITHENA 0.125% (control) group. Results are shown in Table 4 . *In VANISH-1, a significant dose-response trend was evident between the percent of responders and the dose concentration of VARITHENA ( P< 0.0001).

In VANISH-1 and VANISH-2, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in VEINES-QOL in the pooled VARITHENA treatment groups were 21.2 and 21.6, respectively, at Week 8 compared with 7.7 and 7.4 points in the placebo groups, respectively. For both studies, the differences between these improvements are statistically significant ( P< 0.0001). For efficacy endpoints, VARITHENA treatment effects were consistent across subgroups of age, sex, BMI (up to 48 kg/m 2 ), CEAP clinical class, GSV diameter (up to 25.9 mm), and VCSS."

Inspect the pouch and components for damage (do not use product if there are any visible signs of damage to pouch or components). Preparing the Patient Preparations for treating the patient with VARITHENA should include the following steps: Position the patient comfortably on the treatment table in a supine position with their hip externally rotated to facilitate access to the GSV. Use ultrasound to find the best site for venous access. Using an aseptic technique, infiltrate the skin over the venous access point with local anesthetic. Obtain venous access under ultrasound guidance. IV catheters that are 16 to 22 gauge and 40 - to 50 - mm long or micropuncture sets are recommended for venous access. Prefill the manometer tube with sterile heparinized normal saline solution and connect to the IV catheter. Confirm venous access by aspirating with a syringe, blood should be dark and under low pressure. Flush the IV catheter and manometer tube with heparinized normal saline and secure it to the skin with adhesive tape, leave the saline syringe connected. With the IV catheter in place and secure, place the patient supine and elevate the leg to approximately 45 degrees. Complete all preparation of the patient and preparations for VARITHENA injectable foam injection before generation of the foam. VARITHENA Preparation 1 Wearing appropriate sterile gloves, open Bi-Canister pouch using a pair of scissors. Place canisters upright on a cleaned (sterile wipes) stable surface with the white oxygen canister on top ( Figure 4 ) . Discard empty pouch. 2 Remove the safety clip by lifting one corner of the clip out ( Figure 5 ) . Discard the safety clip. Gas Activation of the VARITHENA Canistern 3 To begin the gas transfer, twist the canisters together clockwise ( Figure 6 ) until they come to a stop and the small indicators/marks on the collars are aligned ( Figure 7 ) . You may hear a bubbling sound. While the canisters are activating, keep them upright on the clean flat surface for 1 minute. Use a timing device to keep track of the 1 minute time. Extended gassing periods (more than 10 minutes) are undesirable. 4 Note: In order to maintain sterility of the VARITHENA transfer unit, the following steps must be followed. While waiting 1 minute for the gas transfer, open a new VARITHENA transfer unit, blister pack, but leave the VARITHENA transfer unit in the package ( Figure 8 ) . The manometer tubing (20 inch) should have been previously filled with sterile heparinized normal saline solution. 5 After 1 minute, Twist the two canisters by turning them in the opposite direction (counterclockwise) as before ( Figure 9 ) . Pull straight up to separate the oxygen canister from the VARITHENA canister, as shown ( Figure 10 ) . Do not separate canisters until you have a VARITHENA transfer unit ready to place onto the VARITHENA canister (See step 6 ). Put the oxygen canister (with white collar) aside. The VARITHENA canister (with blue collar) should remain on a clean flat surface, in the upright position. Write today\u2019s date and time in the \u201cDate and Time of Activation\u201d box on the VARITHENA canister ( Figure 11 ) Connecting a new VARITHENA transfer unit and syringe 6 Remove the VARITHENA transfer unit from the blister pack, wearing a fresh pair of sterile gloves. Make sure not to touch the sterile underside of the VARITHENA transfer unit, (discard VARITHENA transfer unit if contaminated). Immediately place the VARITHENA transfer unit on top of the blue VARITHENA canister. Gently rotate the VARITHENA transfer unit clockwise as indicated ( Figure 12 ) until it drops into the collar threads then twist the VARITHENA transfer unit (clockwise) until it reaches a stop ( Figure 13 ). The system is now activated and ready for use. 7 Once all preparations for injection are complete, i.e., cannula in situ, patient\u2019s leg elevated and a good ultrasound view of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) obtained, foam may be generated for immediate use. Open a sterile 10 mL silicone-free syringe blister pack and keep it in the package until needed. Remove the syringe from the package, and connect it to the VARITHENA transfer unit as shown ( Figure 14 ). Priming a New Syringe 8 Gently press down the VARITHENA transfer unit to begin producing foam ( Figure 15 ). Using continuous pressure, allow the silicone-free syringe to fill between 3 mL and 5 mL. Release the pressure on the VARITHENA transfer unit and leave the syringe connected. 9 Push the silicone-free syringe plunger in fully to discard its contents ( Figure 16 ). Do not disconnect the syringe. Note: The foam will automatically be diverted into the waste chamber within the VARITHENA transfer unit ( Figure 17 ) . This process eliminates the small quantity of air in the syringe and VARITHENA transfer unit. Generation of Foam 10 Foam Generation: The technique to produce usable foam requires a single purge cycle before filling the syringe, a process that takes less than 1 second. Important Note: Foam must be generated by pushing down on the VARITHENA transfer unit continuously without pulling back on the plunger of the syringe (aspirating). While holding the silicone-free syringe plunger in place, gently press down on the VARITHENA transfer unit to begin the purge cycle ( Figure 18 ). Visually inspect the flowing foam inside the VARITHENA transfer unit to make sure the visible air bubbles have been expelled (less than 1 second) before releasing the syringe plunger and allowing it to fill to the desired volume ( Figure 19 ). Draw up to 5 mL of foam into the syringe. Inspecting and Injecting Foam 11 After the silicone-free syringe has filled to the desired volume, wait 10 seconds to allow the pressure to equalize before removing the syringe from the VARITHENA transfer unit ( Figure 20 ). WARNING: As the foam fills the syringe and before injecting, inspect the syringe full of foam for any visible bubbles (easily seen with the unaided eye at arm\u2019s length). If there are any present, empty the foam into the VARITHENA transfer unit waste chamber and refill the syringe. 12 Remove the syringe from the VARITHENA transfer unit and inspect it for visible bubbles ( Figure 21 ) . If no visible bubbles are present then the foam is ready for use. Use the foam within 75 seconds of generation or discard and generate new foam. WARNING: The total amount of foam injected in any one treatment session must not exceed 15 mL, comprised of individual injections of up to 5 mL each. After each treatment session, mark-off on the canister label the number of aliquots of up to 5 mL of usable foam drawn from the canister per step 11 ( Figure 22 ). 13 Connect a syringe of freshly generated foam to the manometer tubing, which is already connected to the cannula, in preparation for the initial injection. The manometer tubing (20) inch should have been previously filled with sterile heparinized normal saline solution. 14 Inject the foam at approximately 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL per second through the manometer tubing. Five (5) mLs of foam should be injected in approximately 10 seconds. Always inspect the foam as it passes through the manometer tubing for visible bubbles ( Figure 23 ). If any visible bubbles are seen (easily seen with the unaided eye at arm's length) they should be aspirated back into the silicone-free syringe and the syringe contents discarded back into the VARITHENA transfer unit waste chamber, and a fresh syringe of foam generated. Notes: Use a new sterile syringe after each injection. WARNING: The total amount of foam injected in any one treatment session must not exceed 15 mL, comprised of individual injections of up to 5 mL each Do not remove VARITHENA transfer unit if the VARITHENA canister is to be stored (see Storage) Change sterile gloves appropriately, to limit any contamination of the VARITHENA transfer unit and Bi-Canister. Compression Pads 15 Once treatment is complete, the Compression Pads should be used: The objective of the pads is to focus the compression forces on the treated vein to keep them as free from blood as possible, thus minimizing retained thrombus. The compression pads supplied should be placed along the course of the treated trunk vein in the thigh, and over raised treated varicose veins above and below the knee. The pads may be shaped to follow the course of the veins. The pads should be placed outside the first layer of limited stretch bandage and held in place by a second layer of bandage. The appropriate length compression stocking is then applied. Replacing the VARITHENA Transfer Unit Important Note: Do not replace the VARITHENA transfer unit if the canister is to be stored for future use. The activated VARITHENA canister should always be stored in an appropriately cleaned area with a VARITHENA transfer unit in place in the upright position at or below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C), do not refrigerate or freeze. Replace the VARITHENA transfer unit just prior to the next treatment session. 16 Wearing appropriate new sterile gloves, hold the VARITHENA canister, twist the VARITHENA transfer unit counterclockwise and then pull up to separate from the canister ( Figure 24 ). 17 Discard the old VARITHENA transfer unit and open a new VARITHENA transfer unit. Make sure not to touch the sterile underside of the VARITHENA transfer unit. 18 Swab the uncovered shuttle with a fresh sterile alcohol wipe ( Figure 25 ) and immediately place the VARITHENA transfer unit on top of the VARITHENA canister. Gently rotate the VARITHENA transfer unit clockwise until it drops into the collar threads ( Figure 26 ) , then twist the VARITHENA transfer unit (clockwise) until it reaches a stop ( Figure 27 ) . The VARITHENA device now ready for use for a new treatment session, following the instructions in Steps 7 to 15. Storage and Disposal Note: The activated VARITHENA canister should always be stored with a VARITHENA transfer unit in place in the upright position at or below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) - do not refrigerate or freeze, in an appropriately controlled clean area to limit contamination.
