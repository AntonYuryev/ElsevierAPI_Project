( 7 ) 7.1 Drug Interactions Use of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is contraindicated in women who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants (such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers) with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is not recommended. 7.2 Drug-Food Interactions A food-effect study demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride may be further delayed, and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 7.3 False Positive Urine Tests for Methadone, Opiates and PCP False positive drug screens for methadone, opiates, and PCP can occur with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for use in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.2 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3-year-old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B 6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3 to 18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 hours and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B 6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B 6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3 to 18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 hours and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B 6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 weeks to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride compared to placebo (see Table 6).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Severe drowsiness can occur when used in combination with alcohol or other sedating medications. (7) 7.1 Drug Interactions Use of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is contraindicated in women who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants (such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers) with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is not recommended. 7.2 Drug-Food Interactions A food-effect study demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride may be further delayed, and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.3 False Positive Urine Tests for Methadone, Opiates and PCP False positive drug screens for methadone, opiates, and PCP can occur with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use. Confirmatory tests, such as Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), should be used to confirm the identity of the substance in the event of a positive immunoassay result.",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for use in pregnant women. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.3 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principle metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principle metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principle metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principle metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride compared to placebo (see Table 6).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets are intended for use in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets are intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.2 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions.

There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets are intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride."

      "8.2 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3 to 18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3 to 18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets compared to placebo (see Table 6).

( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets are intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data \u200bHuman Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.2 Lactation \u200bRisk Summary Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2). Table 3 \u2013 Pharmacokinetics of Doxylamine and Pyridoxine Following Single Dose and Multiple Dose Administration of Doxylamine Succinate and Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Delayed-Release Tablets to Healthy Non-Pregnant Adult Women AUC 0-last (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-inf (ng\u2022h/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) T 1/2el (h) Doxylamine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 911.4 \u00b1 205.6 1280.9 \u00b1 369.3 83.3 \u00b1 20.6 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 10.1 \u00b1 2.1 Multiple 3661.3 \u00b1 1279.2 3721.5 \u00b1 1318.5 168.6 \u00b1 38.5 7.8 \u00b1 1.6 11.9 \u00b1 3.3 Pyridoxine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 39.3 \u00b1 16.5 43.4 \u00b1 16.5 32.6 \u00b1 15.0 5.7 \u00b1 1.5 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Multiple 59.3 \u00b1 33.9 64.5 \u00b1 36.4 46.1 \u00b1 28.3 5.6 \u00b1 1.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 Food Effect The administration of food delays the absorption of both doxylamine and pyridoxine. This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets -treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets compared to placebo (see Table 6).

( 5.3 ) 5.1 Activities Requiring Mental Alertness Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets may cause somnolence due to the anticholinergic properties of doxylamine succinate, an antihistamine. Women should avoid engaging in activities requiring complete mental alertness, such as driving or operating heavy machinery, while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets until cleared to do so by their healthcare provider. Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets use is not recommended if a woman is concurrently using central nervous system (CNS) depressants including alcohol. The combination may result in severe drowsiness leading to falls or accidents [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Concomitant Medical Conditions Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets have anticholinergic properties and, therefore, should be used with caution in women with: increased intraocular pressure, narrow angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction and urinary bladder-neck obstruction. 5.3 Interference with Urine Screen for Methadone, Opiates and Phencyclidine Phosphate (PCP) There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for methadone, opiates, and PCP with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] ."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Severe drowsiness can occur when used in combination with alcohol or other sedating medications. ( 7 ) 7.1 Drug Interactions Use of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets is contraindicated in women who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants (such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers) with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets is not recommended. 7.2 Drug-Food Interactions A food-effect study demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets may be further delayed, and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 7.3 False Positive Urine Tests for Methadone, Opiates and PCP False positive drug screens for methadone, opiates, and PCP can occur with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use. Confirmatory tests, such as Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), should be used to confirm the identity of the substance in the event of a positive immunoassay result."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets are intended for use in pregnant women. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets are intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.2 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology.",

Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets have been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2). Table 3: Pharmacokinetics of Doxylamine and Pyridoxine Following Single Dose and Multiple Dose Administration of Doxylamine Succinate and Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Delayed-Release Tablets to Healthy Non-Pregnant Adult Women AUC 0-last (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-inf (ng\u2022h/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) T 1/2el (h) Doxylamine Mean \u00b1 SD N = 18 Single 911.4 \u00b1 205.6 1280.9 \u00b1 369.3 83.3 \u00b1 20.6 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 10.1 \u00b1 2.1 Multiple 3661.3 \u00b1 1279.2 3721.5 \u00b1 1318.5 168.6 \u00b1 38.5 7.8 \u00b1 1.6 11.9 \u00b1 3.3 Pyridoxine Mean \u00b1 SD N = 18 Single 39.3 \u00b1 16.5 43.4 \u00b1 16.5 32.6 \u00b1 15.0 5.7 \u00b1 1.5 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Multiple 59.3 \u00b1 33.9 64.5 \u00b1 36.4 46.1 \u00b1 28.3 5.6 \u00b1 1.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 Food Effect The administration of food delays the absorption of both doxylamine and pyridoxine. This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets have been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principal metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principal metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride delayed-release tablets compared to placebo (see Table 6).

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Natural substances that have vitamin B 6 activity are pyridoxine in plants and pyridoxal or pyridoxamine in animals. All 3 are converted to pyridoxal phosphate by the enzyme pyridoxal kinase. The physiologically active forms of vitamin B 6 are pyridoxal phosphate (codecarboxylase) and pyridoxamine phosphate. Riboflavin is required for the conversion of pyridoxine phosphate to pyridoxal phosphate. Vitamin B 6 acts as a coenzyme in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. In protein metabolism, it participates in the decarboxylation of amino acids, conversion of tryptophan to niacin or to serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine), deamination, and transamination and transulfuration of amino acids. In carbohydrate metabolism, it is responsible for the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. The total adult body pool consists of 16 to 25 mg of pyridoxine. Its half-life appears to be 15 to 20 days. Vitamin B 6 is degraded to 4-pyridoxic acid in the liver. This metabolite is excreted in the urine. The need for pyridoxine increases with the amount of protein in the diet. The tryptophan load test appears to uncover early vitamin B 6 deficiency by detecting xanthinurea. The average adult minimum daily requirement is about 1.25 mg. The \u2018\u2018Recommended Dietary Allowance\u2019\u2019 of the National Academy of Sciences is estimated to be as much as 2.2 mg for adults and 2.5 mg for pregnant and lactating women. The requirements are more in persons having certain genetic defects or those being treated with isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INHJ) or oral contraceptives."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Injection is effective for the treatment of pyridoxine deficiency as seen in the following: Inadequate dietary intake. Drug-induced deficiency, as from isoniazid (INH) or oral contraceptives. Inborn errors of metabolism, e.g., vitamin B 6 dependent convulsions or vitamin B 6 responsive anemia. The parenteral route is indicated when oral administration is not feasible as in anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and preoperative and postoperative conditions. It is also indicated when gastrointestinal absorption is impaired."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General Single deficiency, as of pyridoxine alone, is rare. Multiple vitamin deficiency is to be expected in any inadequate diet. Patients treated with levodopa should avoid supplemental vitamins that contain more than 5 mg pyridoxine in the daily dose. Women taking oral contraceptives may exhibit increased pyridoxine requirements. Drug Interactions Pyridoxine supplements should not be given to patients receiving levodopa, because the action of the latter drug is antagonized by pyridoxine. However, this vitamin may be used concurrently in patients receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category A \u2014The requirement for pyridoxine appears to be increased during pregnancy. Pyridoxine is sometimes of value in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Nursing Mothers The need for pyridoxine is increased during lactation. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when pyridoxine hydrochloride is administered to a nursing woman. Usage in Children Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants (such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers) with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is not recommended. 7.2 Drug-Food Interactions A food-effect study demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride may be further delayed, and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.3 False Positive Urine Tests for Methadone, Opiates and PCP False positive drug screens for methadone, opiates, and PCP can occur with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for use in pregnant women. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.3 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2). Table 3 \u2013 Pharmacokinetics of Doxylamine and Pyridoxine Following Single Dose and Multiple Dose Administration of Doxylamine Succinate and Pyridoxine Hydrochloride to Healthy Non-Pregnant Adult Women AUC 0-last (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-inf (ng\u2022h/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) T \u00bdel (h) Doxylamine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 911.4 \u00b1 205.6 1,280.9 \u00b1 369.3 83.3 \u00b1 20.6 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 10.1 \u00b1 2.1 Multiple 3,661.3 \u00b1 1,279.2 3,721.5 \u00b1 1,318.5 168.6 \u00b1 38.5 7.8 \u00b1 1.6 11.9 \u00b1 3.3 Pyridoxine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 39.3 \u00b1 16.5 43.4 \u00b1 16.5 32.6 \u00b1 15.0 5.7 \u00b1 1.5 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Multiple 59.3 \u00b1 33.9 64.5 \u00b1 36.4 46.1 \u00b1 28.3 5.6 \u00b1 1.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 Food Effect The administration of food delays the absorption of both doxylamine and pyridoxine. This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principle metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principle metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2).

This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principle metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principle metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride compared to placebo (see Table 6).

(7) 7.1 Drug Interactions Use of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is contraindicated in women who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines. Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants (such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers) with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is not recommended. 7.2 Drug-Food Interactions A food-effect study demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride may be further delayed, and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. 7.3 False Positive Urine Tests for Methadone, Opiates and PCP False positive drug screens for methadone, opiates, and PCP can occur with doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride use.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for use in pregnant women. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management. Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling. No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies (cohort, case control and meta-analyses) designed to detect possible teratogenicity. A meta-analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride, with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. A second meta-analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case-control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride. 8.3 Lactation Women should not breastfeed while using doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected. Excitement, irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk. Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk. There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in children under 18 years of age have not been established. Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children. The overdose cases have been characterized by coma, grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest. Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest. A toxic dose for children of more than 1.8 mg/kg has been reported. A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1,000 mg doxylamine succinate. However, there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested, the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology."

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses. The mean accumulation index is more than 1.0 suggesting that doxylamine accumulates following multiple dosing (see Table 3). Although no accumulation was observed for pyridoxine, the mean accumulation index for each metabolite (pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate) is more than 1.0 following multiple-dose administration of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride. The time to reach the maximum concentration is not affected by multiple doses (see Table 2). Table 3 \u2013 Pharmacokinetics of Doxylamine and Pyridoxine Following Single Dose and Multiple Dose Administration of Doxylamine Succinate and Pyridoxine Hydrochloride to Healthy Non-Pregnant Adult Women AUC 0-last (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-inf (ng\u2022h/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) T 1/2el (h) Doxylamine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 911.4 \u00b1 205.6 1,280.9 \u00b1 369.3 83.3 \u00b1 20.6 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 10.1 \u00b1 2.1 Multiple 3,661.3 \u00b1 1,279.2 3,721.5 \u00b1 1,318.5 168.6 \u00b1 38.5 7.8 \u00b1 1.6 11.9 \u00b1 3.3 Pyridoxine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 39.3 \u00b1 16.5 43.4 \u00b1 16.5 32.6 \u00b1 15.0 5.7 \u00b1 1.5 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Multiple 59.3 \u00b1 33.9 64.5 \u00b1 36.4 46.1 \u00b1 28.3 5.6 \u00b1 1.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 Food Effect The administration of food delays the absorption of both doxylamine and pyridoxine. This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principle metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principle metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been characterized in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Pharmacokinetic results for doxylamine and pyridoxine, including its vitamin B6 metabolites, pyridoxal, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate, pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, are summarized in Tables 2 to 5. Absorption A single-dose (two tablets) and multiple-dose (four tablets daily), open-label study was conducted to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride administered in healthy non-pregnant adult women. Single-doses (two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 1 and 2. Multiple-doses (one tablet in the morning, one tablet in the afternoon and two tablets at bedtime) were administered on Days 3-18. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected pre-and post-dose on Days 2 and 18 as well as pre-dose prior to bedtime dose only (trough) on Days 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18. Doxylamine and pyridoxine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the jejunum. The C max of doxylamine and pyridoxine are achieved within 7.5 and 5.5 hours, respectively (see Table 2).

Table 3 \u2013 Pharmacokinetics of Doxylamine and Pyridoxine Following Single Dose and Multiple Dose Administration of Doxylamine Succinate and Pyridoxine Hydrochloride to Healthy Non-Pregnant Adult Women AUC 0-last (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-inf (ng\u2022h/mL) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) T 1/2el (h) Doxylamine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 911.4 \u00b1 205.6 1,280.9 \u00b1 369.3 83.3 \u00b1 20.6 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 10.1 \u00b1 2.1 Multiple 3,661.3 \u00b1 1,279.2 3,721.5 \u00b1 1,318.5 168.6 \u00b1 38.5 7.8 \u00b1 1.6 11.9 \u00b1 3.3 Pyridoxine Mean\u00b1SD N=18 Single 39.3 \u00b1 16.5 43.4 \u00b1 16.5 32.6 \u00b1 15.0 5.7 \u00b1 1.5 0.5 \u00b1 0.2 Multiple 59.3 \u00b1 33.9 64.5 \u00b1 36.4 46.1 \u00b1 28.3 5.6 \u00b1 1.3 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 Food Effect The administration of food delays the absorption of both doxylamine and pyridoxine. This delay is associated with a lower peak concentration of doxylamine, but the extent of absorption is not affected (see Table 4). The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate metabolites also contribute to the biological activity. Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine, lowering its C max and AUC by approximately 50% compared to fasting conditions. Similarly, food significantly reduces pyridoxal AUC and reduces its C max by 50% compared to fasting conditions. In contrast, food slightly increases pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate C max and extent of absorption. As for pyridoxamine and pyridoxamine 5\u2019-phosphate, the rate and extent of absorption seem to decrease under fed conditions.

Its main active metabolite, pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) accounts for at least 60% of circulating vitamin B6 concentrations. Metabolism Doxylamine is biotransformed in the liver by N-dealkylation to its principle metabolites N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine. Pyridoxine is a prodrug primarily metabolized in the liver. Excretion The principle metabolites of doxylamine, N-desmethyl-doxylamine and N, N-didesmethyldoxylamine, are excreted by the kidney. The terminal elimination half-life of doxylamine and pyridoxine are 12.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively (see Table 5).

      "14. CLINICAL STUDIES A double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation (median 9 weeks of gestation) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride or placebo. Two tablets of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2, the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and, beginning on Day 3, to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime. Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 (\u00b1 1 day), the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid-afternoon. A maximum of four tablets (one in the morning, one in the mid-afternoon and two at bedtime) were taken daily. Over the treatment period, 19% of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride-treated patients remained on 2 tablets daily, 21% received 3 tablets daily, and 60% received 4 tablets daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique-Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score. The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes, number of daily heaves, and length of daily nausea in hours, for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 (no symptoms) to 15 (most severe). At baseline, the mean PUQE score was 9.0 in the doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride arm and 8.8 in the placebo arm. There was a 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.2 to 1.2 with p-value 0.006) mean decrease (improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride compared to placebo (see Table 6).
