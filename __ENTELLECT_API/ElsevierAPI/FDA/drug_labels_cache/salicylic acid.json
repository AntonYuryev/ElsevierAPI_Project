    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Salicylic acid has been shown to produce desquamation of the horny layer of skin while not affecting qualitative or quantitative changes in the structure of the viable epidermis. The mechanism of action has been attributed to the dissolution of intercellular cement substances. In a study of the percutaneous absorption of salicylic acid in a 6% salicylic acid gel in four patients with extensive active psoriasis, Taylor and Halprin showed that the peak serum salicylate levels never exceeded 5 mg/100 ml even though more than 60% of the applied salicylic acid was absorbed. Systemic toxic reactions are usually associated with much higher serum levels (30 to 40 mg/100 ml). Peak serum levels occurred within 5 hours of the topical application under occlusion. The sites were occluded for 10 hours over the entire body surface below the neck. Since salicylates are distributed in the extracellular space, patients with a contracted extracellular space due to dehydration or diuretics have higher salicylate levels than those with a normal extracellular space (See PRECAUTIONS ). The major metabolites identified in the urine after topical administration are salicylic acid (52%), salicylate glucuronides (42%) and free salicylic acid (6%). The urinary metabolites after percutaneous absorption differ from those after oral salicylate administration; those derived from percutaneous absorption contain more salicylate glucuronides and less salicyluric and salicylic acid. Almost 95% of a single dose of salicylate is excreted within 24 hours of its entrance into the extracellular space. Fifty to eighty percent of salicylate is protein bound to albumin. Salicylates compete with the binding of several drugs and can modify the actions of these drugs. By similar competitive mechanisms other drugs can influence the serum levels of salicylate (See PRECAUTIONS )."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use over large areas, especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment, could result in salicylism. Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present. In children under12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the area to be treated should be limited and the patient monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of hearing, tinnitus, lethargy, hyperpnea, diarrhea, and psychic disturbances. In the event of salicylic acid toxicity, the use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel should be discontinued. Fluids should be administered to promote urinary excretion. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate (oral or intravenous) should be instituted as appropriate. Patients should be cautioned against the use of oral aspirin and other salicylate containing medications, such as sports injury creams, to avoid additional excessive exposure to salicylic acid. Where needed, aspirin should be replaced by an alternative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that is not salicylate based. Patients should be advised not to apply occlusive dressings, clothing or other occlusive topical products such as petrolatum-based ointments to prevent excessive systemic exposure to salicylic acid. Excessive application of the product other than what is needed to cover the affected area will not result in a more rapid therapeutic benefit. Due to potential risk of developing Reye's syndrome, salicylate products should not be used in children and teenagers with varicella or influenza, unless directed by a licensed health care practitioner."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "DRUG INTERACTIONS (The following interactions are from a published review and include reports concerning both oral and topical salicylate administration. The relationship of these interactions to the use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel is not known). I. Due to the competition of salicylate with other drugs for binding to serum albumin the following drug interactions may occur: II. Drugs changing salicylate levels by altering renal tubular reabsorption: III. Drugs with complicated interactions with salicylates: The following alterations of laboratory tests have been reported during salicylate therapy: Pregnancy: (Category C) - Salicylic acid has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and monkeys. It is difficult to extrapolate from oral doses of acetylsalicylic acid used in these studies to topical administration as the oral dose to monkeys may represent 4 times the maximal daily human dose of salicylic acid when applied topically over a large body surface. There are no adequate and well- controlled studies in pregnant women. Salicylic Acid 6% Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers : Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the mother's use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If used by nursing mothers, it should not be used on the chest area to avoid accidental contamination of the child. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No data is available concerning potential carcinogenic or reproductive effects of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel . It has been shown to lack mutagenic potential in the Ames Salmonella test. I. II III IV"

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The preferable method of use is to apply Salicylic Acid 6% Gel thoroughly to the affected area and to cover the treated area at night after washing and before retiring. Preferably, the skin should be hydrated for at least five minutes prior to application. The medication is washed off in the morning, and if excessive drying and/or irritation is observed, a bland cream or lotion may be applied. Once clearing is apparent, the occasional use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel will usually maintain the remission. In those areas where occlusion is difficult or impossible, application may be made more frequently, hydration by wet packs or baths prior to application apparently enhances the effect (See WARNINGS ). Unless hands are being treated, hands should be rinsed thoroughly after application. Excessive repeated application of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel will not necessarily increase its therapeutic benefit, but could result in increased local intolerance and systemic adverse effects such as salicylism."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Salicylic acid has been shown to produce desquamation of the horny layer of skin while not affecting qualitative or quantitative changes in structure of the viable epidermis. 1,2 The mechanism of action has been attributed to dissolution of intercellular cement substance. 3 In a study of the percutaneous absorption of salicylic acid from Salicylic Acid 6% Gel in four patients with extensive active psoriasis, Taylor and Halprin 4 showed that peak serum salicylate levels never exceeded 5 mg/100 mL even though more than 60% of the applied salicylic acid was absorbed. Systemic toxic reactions are usually associated with much higher serum levels (30 to 40 mg/100mL). Peak serum levels occurred within 5 hours of the topical application under occlusion. The sites were occluded for 10 hours over the entire body surface below the neck. Since salicylates are distributed in the extracellular space, patients with a contracted extracellular space due to dehydration or diuretics have higher salicylate levels than those with a normal extracellular space. 5 (See PRECAUTIONS ). The major metabolites identified in the urine after topical administration are salicyluric acid (52%), salicylate glucuronides (42%), and free salicylic acid (6%). 4 The urinary metabolites after percutaneous absorption differ from those after oral salicylate administration; those derived from percutaneous absorption contain more glucuronides and less salicyluric and salicylic acid. Almost 95% of a single dose of salicylate is excreted within 24 hours of its entrance into the extracellular space. 5 Fifty to eighty percent of salicylate is protein bound to albumin. Salicylates compete with the binding of several drugs and can modify the action of these drugs. By similar competetive mechanisms other drugs can influence the serum levels of salicylate. (See PRECAUTIONS )."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Contact with eyes, lips, broken or inflamed skin, and all mucous membranes should be avoided. Prolonged use over large areas, especially in children and those patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment could result in salicylism. Concomitant use of other drugs which may contribute to elevated serum salicylate levels should be avoided where the potential for toxicity is present. In children under 12 years of age and those patients with renal or hepatic impairment, the area to be treated should be limited and the patient monitored closely for signs of salicylate toxicity: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, loss of hearing, tinnitus, lethargy, hyperpnoea, diarrhea, psychic disturbances. In the event of salicylic acid toxicity, the use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel should be discontinued. Fluids should be administered to promote urinary excretion. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate (oral or intravenous) should be instituted as appropriate. Considering the potential of developing Reye\u2019s syndrome, salicylate products should not be administered to children or teenagers with varicella or influenza, unless directed by a physician."

Keep away from heat and open flame. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children ."

      "Drug Interactions. (The following interactions are from a published review 5 and include reports concerning both oral and topical salicylate administration. The relationship of these interactions to the use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel is not known.) I.

      "Pregnancy (Category C) - Salicylic acid has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and monkeys. It is difficult to extrapolate from oral doses of acetylsalicylic acid used in these studies to topical administration as the oral dose to monkeys may represent 4 times the maximum daily human dose of salicylic acid (as supplied in one tube, 40 g of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel) when applied topically over a large body surface. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Salicylic Acid 6% Gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether topically applied salicylic acid is excreted in human milk. Due to the fact that many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised by physicians when administering Salicylic Acid 6% Gel to nursing mothers and nursing mothers should certainly not apply Salicylic Acid 6% Gel to the chest area or any other part of the body with which the nursing child\u2019s mouth is likely to come in contact. Because of the potential for serious advers reactions in nursing infants from the mother\u2019s use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The preferable method of use is to apply Salicylic Acid 6% Gel thoroughly to the affected area and occlude the area at night. Preferably, the skin should be hydrated for at least five minutes prior to application. The medication is washed off in the morning and if excessive drying and/or irritation is observed a bland cream or lotion may be applied. Once clearing is apparent, the occasional use of Salicylic Acid 6% Gel will usually maintain the remission. In those areas where occlusion is difficult or impossible, application may be made more frequently; hydration by wet packs or baths prior to application apparently enhances the effect. Unless hands are being treated, hands should be rinsed thoroughly after application."
