    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Fosinopril sodium is the sodium salt of fosinopril, the ester prodrug of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinoprilat. It contains a phosphinate group capable of specific binding to the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Fosinopril sodium is designated chemically as: L-proline, 4-cyclohexyl-1-[[[2-methyl-1-(1-oxopropoxy) propoxy] (4-phenylbutyl) phosphinyl] acetyl]-, sodium salt, trans- . Fosinopril sodium is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is soluble in water (100 mg/mL), methanol, and ethanol and slightly soluble in hexane. Its structural formula is: C 30 H 45 NNaO 7 P M.W. 585.65 Fosinopril sodium, USP, is available for oral administration as 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients include: crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and sodium stearyl fumarate.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) , the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N = 20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u2265 25 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and C max values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u2265 90% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following 4 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after 3 months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after 1 week and the total duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a 2 week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (1 study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to 2 years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 25 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to ACE inhibitors. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents increasing serum potassium Coadministration of fosinopril with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Other Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for 3 days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Do not administer fosinopril sodium tablets to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Pediatric Patients )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions )."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 2 to 3 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N = 688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N = 184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at > 1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.

Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported With ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS , General ). Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20-month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within 1 hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued 2 to 3 days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets USP (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets USP to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least 2 hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis, and if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances < 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis )."

      "DESCRIPTION Fosinopril sodium, USP is a white to almost white powder, soluble (>100 mg/mL) in water, in ethanol, and in methanol, and slightly soluble in hexane. Fosinopril sodium is designated chemically as L-proline, 4-cyclohexyl-1-[[[2-methyl-1-(1-oxopropoxy)propoxy](4-phenylbutyl)phosphinyl]acetyl]-, sodium salt, trans- ; its structural formula is: Its molecular formula is C 30 H 45 NNaO 7 P, and its molecular weight is 585.65. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, is a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Fosinopril is converted to fosinoprilat by hepatic cleavage of the ester group. Hydrochlorothiazide, USP is a white or practically white, practically odorless, crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water; freely soluble in sodium hydroxide solution, in n-butylamine, and in dimethylformamide; sparingly soluble in methanol; and insoluble in ether, in chloroform, and in dilute mineral acids. Hydrochlorothiazide is designated chemically as 6-chloro-3,4-dihydro-2 H -1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide; its structural formula is: Its molecular formula is C 7 H 8 ClN 3 O 4 S 2 , and its molecular weight is 297.73. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP are a combination of fosinopril sodium, USP and hydrochlorothiazide, USP. They are available for oral use in two tablet strengths: fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP 10 mg/12.5 mg, containing 10 mg of fosinopril sodium, USP and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, USP; and fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP 20 mg/12.5 mg, containing 20 mg of fosinopril sodium, USP and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, USP. The inactive ingredients of the tablets include lactose anhydrous, ferric oxide red, ferric oxide yellow, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, isopropyl alcohol, glyceryl distearate, and sodium lauryl sulfate.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Fosinopril and fosinoprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 8 weeks had elevations of serum potassium of approximately 0.1 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone had a mean reduction in serum potassium of 0.15 mEq/L, while patients who received combined treatment with 10/12.5 mg or 20/12.5 mg of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide had reductions of 0.07 and 0.03 mEq/L, respectively. (See PRECAUTIONS . ) Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism The absolute absorption of fosinopril averages 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine. While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Following oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 2.5 hours, and the extent of absorption is 50 to 80%. The reported studies of food effects on hydrochlorothiazide absorption have been inconclusive. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is increased by agents that reduce gastrointestinal motility. It is reported to be decreased by 50% in patients with congestive heart failure. Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts fosinopril to its active metabolite, fosinoprilat. The time to peak plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat is about 3 hours, independent of the administered dose of fosinopril. In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, conversion of fosinopril to fosinoprilat may be slowed, but the extent of this conversion is unchanged. Fosinoprilat is highly protein bound (95%), but has negligible binding to cellular components of blood. The peak serum concentration and the area under the concentration-time curve of fosinoprilat is directly proportional to the administered dose of fosinopril. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but fosinoprilat does cross the placenta of pregnant animals. In humans, hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely, and levels in umbilical-cord blood are similar to those in the maternal circulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6 to 7.8 L/kg, and its measured plasma protein binding is 67.9%. The drug also accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6 to 1.8 times those measured in plasma. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat is eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the effective half-life of accumulation of fosinoprilat following multiple dosing of fosinopril sodium is 11.5 hours. Thus, steady-state concentrations of fosinoprilat should be reached after 2 or 3 doses of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide given once daily. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal renal function, while absorption, bioavailability, and protein binding are not appreciably altered. The clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with the degree of renal insufficiency, because the diminished renal elimination is offset by increased hepatobiliary elimination. A modest increase in plasma AUC levels (less than two times that in normals) was observed in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency, including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . ) Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5 to 15 hours. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. When fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are administered concomitantly, the pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide are essentially unaffected. Serum levels of fosinoprilat are increased after several weeks of coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and fosinopril, but the increase is not sufficient to warrant any change in dosing. Pharmacodynamics After single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril, serum ACE activity was inhibited by at least 90% from 2 to 12 hours after dosing. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remains suppressed by 85 to 93%. Administration of fosinopril to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. In studies in hypertensive patients after three months of fosinopril monotherapy, hemodynamic responses to various stimuli (isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, mental challenges) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril did not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Instead, fosinopril-induced reduction in blood pressure appears to be mediated by a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. In similar studies, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal-muscle blood flows were all unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once-daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated blood pressures (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In clinical studies of various combinations that included 0 to 40 mg of fosinopril and 0 to 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, the antihypertensive effects were increased with increasing dose of either component. Peak blood pressure reductions were achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The mean reductions in seated blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) associated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10/12.5 after 24 hours were 9 to 18/5 to 7 mmHg greater than those associated with placebo; those associated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide 20/12.5 after 24 hours were 12 to 17/8 to 10 mmHg greater than those associated with placebo. These trough effects were 60 to 90% of the corresponding peak effects. Although hydrochlorothiazide tends to be more effective in low-renin hypertensive patients (mainly blacks), and fosinopril\u2014like other ACE inhibitors\u2014tends to be more effective in high-renin patients (mainly non-blacks), the effectiveness of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide is independent of race, age, and gender."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. These fixed dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . ) In using fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated in patients who are anuric. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide is also contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to fosinopril, to any other ACE inhibitor, to hydrochlorothiazide, or other sulfonamide-derived drugs, or any other ingredient or component in the formulation. Hypersensitivity reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine injection 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Impaired Renal Function Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with severe renal disease. Thiazides may precipitate azotemia in such patients, and the effects of repeated dosing may be cumulative. When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by ACE inhibitors, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (including fosinopril) may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In some studies of hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy, concomitant diuretic therapy, or both. When such patients are treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some ACE-inhibitor-treated hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when the ACE inhibitor has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be required. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients (incidence probably less than once per 10,000 exposures), but more frequently (incidence possibly as great as once per 1,000 exposures) in patients with renal impairment, especially those who also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has also been associated with thiazide diuretics. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia ( see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ). Intrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics is associated with fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that occurred in adults. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg (fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) basis, the doses used were up to 188/94 times (in rats) and 0.6/0.3 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. Impaired Hepatic Function Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that begins with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide who develops jaundice or marked elevation of hepatic enzymes should discontinue fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and receive appropriate medical follow-up. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Also, since the metabolism of fosinopril to fosinoprilat is normally dependent upon hepatic esterases, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of fosinopril. In a study of patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis the rate (but not the extent) of hydrolysis to fosinoprilat was reduced. In these patients the clearance of fosinoprilat was reduced, and the area under the fosinoprilat-time curve was approximately doubled. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Derangements of Serum Electrolytes In clinical trials of fosinopril monotherapy, hyperkalemia (serum potassium at least 10% greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia included renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Conversely, treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremic alkalosis. These disturbances have sometimes been manifest as one or more of dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Hypokalemia can also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The risk of hypokalemia is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH. The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice. Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen. Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result. Other Metabolic Disturbances Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout or overt diabetes may be precipitated in susceptible patients. Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing) and to take no more drug until after consulting with the prescribing physician. Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. The patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the prescribing physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening. Laboratory Tests Therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be interrupted for a few days before carrying out tests of parathyroid function. Fosinopril may cause false low measurement of serum digoxin levels when the Digi-Tab \u00ae (Nuclear Medical) RIA Kit is used. The accuracy of the Coat-A-Count \u00ae (Diagnostic Products Corporation) kit is not affected. Drug Interactions Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics As noted above (\u201cDerangements of Serum Electrolytes\u201d), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient\u2019s serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient\u2019s serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide. Other The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin . Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers , presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fosinopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine , but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied. By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of methenamine. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Fosinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide Reproductive studies and long-term carcinogenicity studies with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide have not been conducted. The combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay. The combination was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo . Fosinopril Sodium No evidence of a carcinogenicity was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to rats and mice for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose was about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 20 (mice) to 40 (rats) times the maximum human dose. Neither fosinopril nor the fosinoprilat moiety was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with up to 60 mg/kg daily. At doses 4 times higher, slight increases in pairing time were seen. This higher dose is about 125 (body surface area basis) or 600 (body-weight basis) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 20 mg a day. Hydrochlorothiazide Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide for two years at doses up to 100 (rats) and 600 (mice) mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, these highest doses were about 2400 times (mice) or 400 times (rats) the fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide dose of 12.5 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, these doses are 226 times (mice) and 82 times (rats) the fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide dose. These studies uncovered no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes; Chinese Hamster bone-marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mg/mL, positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays. Using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide, positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay. No adverse effects upon fertility were seen when rats and mice received dietary hydrochlorothiazide prior to mating and throughout gestation at doses up to 4 (rats) and 100 (mice) mg/kg/day. These doses are from 3.2 (body surface area basis in rats) to 400 (weight basis in mice) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 12.5 mg a day. Nursing Mothers Both fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "Drug Interactions Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics As noted above (\u201cDerangements of Serum Electrolytes\u201d), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient\u2019s serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient\u2019s serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide. Other The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin . Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers , presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fosinopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine , but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide have not been studied. By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of methenamine. Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Fosinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide Reproductive studies and long-term carcinogenicity studies with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide have not been conducted. The combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay. The combination was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo . Fosinopril Sodium No evidence of a carcinogenicity was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to rats and mice for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose was about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 20 (mice) to 40 (rats) times the maximum human dose. Neither fosinopril nor the fosinoprilat moiety was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with up to 60 mg/kg daily. At doses 4 times higher, slight increases in pairing time were seen. This higher dose is about 125 (body surface area basis) or 600 (body-weight basis) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 20 mg a day. Hydrochlorothiazide Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide for two years at doses up to 100 (rats) and 600 (mice) mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, these highest doses were about 2400 times (mice) or 400 times (rats) the fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide dose of 12.5 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, these doses are 226 times (mice) and 82 times (rats) the fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide dose. These studies uncovered no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes; Chinese Hamster bone-marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mg/mL, positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays. Using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide, positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay. No adverse effects upon fertility were seen when rats and mice received dietary hydrochlorothiazide prior to mating and throughout gestation at doses up to 4 (rats) and 100 (mice) mg/kg/day. These doses are from 3.2 (body surface area basis in rats) to 400 (weight basis in mice) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 12.5 mg a day."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 660 patients with hypertension; approximately 137 of these patients were treated for more than one year. The observed adverse events were generally mild, transient, and similar to those seen with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide taken separately. There was no relationship between the incidence of side effects and age. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, the usual duration of therapy was two months. Adverse clinical or laboratory events led to discontinuation of therapy by 4.3% of 368 placebo-treated patients and by 3.5% of 660 fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide in U.S. studies were headache (0.3%), cough (0.3%; see PRECAUTIONS ), and fatigue (0.2%). The side effects considered probably or possibly related to study drug that occurred in placebo-controlled trials in more than 2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide are shown in the table below. Reactions Possibly or Probably Drug-Related (Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Studies) Fosinopril Sodium and Hydrochlorothiazide (N=660) Placebo (N=368) % % Headache 7 12.8 Cough 5.6 1.1 Fatigue 3.9 2.4 Dizziness 3.2 2.2 Upper Respiratory Infection 2.3 2.7 Musculoskeletal Pain 2 1.9 Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in controlled trials in 0.5% to <2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide, and rarer but clinically significant events regardless of causal relationship were: General: Chest pain, weakness, fever, viral infection. Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (seen in 1.8% of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide patients and 0.3% of placebo patients; no patients discontinued therapy due to orthostatic hypotension), edema, flushing, rhythm disturbance, syncope. Dermatologic: Pruritus, rash. Endocrine/Metabolic: Sexual dysfunction, change in libido, breast mass. Gastrointestinal: Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia/heartburn, abdominal pain, gastritis/esophagitis. Immunologic: Angioedema (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema ). Musculoskeletal: Myalgia/muscle cramps. Neurologic/Psychiatric: Somnolence, depression, numbness/paresthesia. Respiratory: Sinus congestion, pharyngitis, rhinitis. Special Senses: Tinnitus. Urogenital: Urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, dysuria. Laboratory Test Abnormalities: Serum electrolytes, uric acid, glucose, magnesium, cholesterol, triglycerides, and calcium (see PRECAUTIONS ). Neutropenia. Antihypertensive monotherapy with fosinopril has been evaluated for safety in more than 1500 patients, of whom approximately 450 patients were treated for a year or more. The observed adverse events included events similar to those seen with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide; in addition, the following others have also been reported with fosinopril: Cardiovascular: Angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, hypotension, claudication. Dermatologic: Urticaria, photosensitivity. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, flatulence, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia. Neurologic/Psychiatric: Memory disturbance, tremor, confusion, mood change, sleep disturbance. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis, and (in two patients) a symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia. Special Senses: Vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency. Laboratory Test Abnormalities: Elevations (usually transient and minor) of BUN and creatinine have been observed, but these have not been more frequent than in parallel patients treated with placebo. The hemoglobin in fosinopril-treated patients generally decreases by an average of 0.1 g/dL, but this nonprogressive change has never been symptomatic. Leukopenia and eosinophilia have also been reported. Serum levels of liver function tests (transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin) have occasionally been found to be elevated, and these elevations have lead to discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of patients. Other risk factors for liver dysfunction have often been present in these cases; in any event the elevations generally have resolved after discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril. Other Adverse Events Reported with ACE Inhibitors Other adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include cardiac arrest; pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia; aplastic anemia; thrombocytopenia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; and a syndrome that may include one or more of arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermopathy, positive ANA titer, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated ESR. Hydrochlorothiazide has now been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency. Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics). Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia. Hematologic: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Immunologic: Necrotizing angiitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), anaphylactic reactions, purpura, urticaria, rash, and photosensitivity. Metabolic: Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hyperuricemia. Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasm. Neurologic: Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of \u226550,000mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is a certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hypotension should be treated by established procedures. In rats, single oral doses of 2600 mg/kg of fosinopril were associated with significant lethality. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses of up to 2750 mg/kg. Both doses are more than 6000 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended daily dose of either fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide in fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide. Data from human overdoses of fosinopril are scanty, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. In human hydrochlorothiazide overdose, the most common signs and symptoms observed have been those of dehydration and electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia). If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinopril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Fosinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of fosinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using fosinopril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses at 5 to 37.5 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component. The hazards (see WARNINGS ) of fosinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent hazards. To minimize dose-independent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to combination therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Dosage must be guided by clinical response; controlled clinical trials showed that the addition of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide to 10 to 20 mg of fosinopril will typically be associated with additional reduction in seated diastolic blood pressure at 24 hours after dosing. On average, the effect of the combination of 10 mg of fosinopril with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was similar to the effect seen with monotherapy using either 40 mg of fosinopril or 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Use in Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , serum creatine roughly \u22653 mg/dL or 265 \u00b5mol/L), loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. In patients with lesser degrees of renal impairment, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used with no change in dosage."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) , the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N = 20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u2265 25 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and C max values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u2265 90% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following 4 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after 3 months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after 1 week and the total duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a 2 week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (1 study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to 2 years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 25 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to ACE inhibitors. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents increasing serum potassium Coadministration of fosinopril with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Other Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for 3 days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Do not administer fosinopril sodium tablets to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Pediatric Patients )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions )."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to ACE inhibitors. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents increasing serum potassium Coadministration of fosinopril with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ).

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 2 to 3 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N = 688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N = 184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at > 1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.

Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported With ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS , General ). Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20-month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within 1 hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued 2 to 3 days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets USP (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets USP to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least 2 hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis, and if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances < 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) , the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N = 20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u2265 25 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and C max values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u2265 90% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following 4 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after 3 months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after 1 week and the total duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a 2 week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (1 study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to 2 years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 25 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to ACE inhibitors. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents increasing serum potassium Coadministration of fosinopril with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Other Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for 3 days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Do not administer fosinopril sodium tablets to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Pediatric Patients )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 2 to 3 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N = 688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N = 184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at > 1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N = 1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular: Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, decreased libido. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation, heartburn, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy. Immunologic: Angioedema (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema ). Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia/muscle cramp. Nervous/Psychiatric: Memory disturbance, tremor, confusion, mood change, paresthesia, sleep disturbance, drowsiness, vertigo. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, pharyngitis, sinusitis/rhinitis, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis. A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Heart Failure) Fosinopril Sodium (N = 361) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N = 373) Incidence (Discontinuation) Dizziness 11.9 (0.6) 5.4 (0.3) Cough 9.7 (0.8) 5.1 (0.0) Hypotension 4.4 (0.8) 0.8 (0.0) Musculoskeletal Pain 3.3 (0.0) 2.7 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 2.2 (0.6) 1.6 (0.3) Diarrhea 2.2 (0.0) 1.3 (0.0) Chest Pain (non-cardiac) 2.2 (0.0) 1.6 (0.0) Upper Respiratory Infection 2.2 (0.0) 1.3 (0.0) Orthostatic Hypotension 1.9 (0.0) 0.8 (0.0) Subjective Cardiac Rhythm Disturbance 1.4 (0.6) 0.8 (0.3) Weakness 1.4 (0.3) 0.5 (0.0) The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium tablets but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N = 516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain. Cardiovascular: Sudden death, cardiorespiratory arrest, shock (0.2%), atrial rhythm disturbance, cardiac rhythm disturbances, non-anginal chest pain, edema lower extremity, hypertension, syncope, conduction disorder, bradycardia, tachycardia. Dermatologic: Pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, sexual dysfunction. Gastrointestinal: Hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, decreased appetite, dry mouth, constipation, flatulence. Immunologic: Angioedema (0.2%). Musculoskeletal: Muscle ache, swelling of an extremity, weakness of an extremity. Nervous/Psychiatric: Cerebral infarction, TIA, depression, numbness, paresthesia, vertigo, behavior change, tremor. Respiratory: Abnormal vocalization, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tracheobronchitis, abnormal breathing, pleuritic chest pain. Special Senses: Vision disturbance, taste disturbance. Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported With ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS , General ). Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20-month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within 1 hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued 2 to 3 days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets USP (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets USP to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least 2 hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis, and if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances < 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Fosinopril and fosinoprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 8 weeks had elevations of serum potassium of approximately 0.1 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone had a mean reduction in serum potassium of 0.15 mEq/L, while patients who received combined treatment with 10/12.5 mg or 20/12.5 mg of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide had reductions of 0.07 and 0.03 mEq/L, respectively. (See PRECAUTIONS ) Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism The absolute absorption of fosinopril averages 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine. While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Following oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 2.5 hours, and the extent of absorption is 50 to 80%. The reported studies of food effects on hydrochlorothiazide absorption have been inconclusive. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is increased by agents that reduce gastrointestinal motility. It is reported to be decreased by 50% in patients with congestive heart failure. Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts fosinopril to its active metabolite, fosinoprilat. The time to peak plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat is about 3 hours, independent of the administered dose of fosinopril. In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, conversion of fosinopril to fosinoprilat may be slowed, but the extent of this conversion is unchanged. Fosinoprilat is highly protein bound (95%), but has negligible binding to cellular components of blood. The peak serum concentration and the area under the concentration-time curve of fosinoprilat is directly proportional to the administered dose of fosinopril. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but fosinoprilat does cross the placenta of pregnant animals. In humans, hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely, and levels in umbilical-cord blood are similar to those in the maternal circulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6 to 7.8 L/kg, and its measured plasma protein binding is 67.9%. The drug also accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6 to 1.8 times those measured in plasma. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat is eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the effective half-life of accumulation of fosinoprilat following multiple dosing of fosinopril sodium is 11.5 hours. Thus, steady-state concentrations of fosinoprilat should bereached after 2 or 3 doses of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets given once daily. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal renal function, while absorption, bioavailability, and protein binding are not appreciably altered. The clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with the degree of renal insufficiency, because the diminished renal elimination is offset by increased hepatobiliary elimination. A modest increase in plasma AUC levels (less than two times that in normals) was observed in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency, including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by the kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5 to 15 hours. In a study of patients with impaired renal function (mean creatine clearance of 19 mL/min), the half-life of hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours. When fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are administered concomitantly, the pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide are essentially unaffected. Serum levels of fosinoprilat are increased after several weeks of coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and fosinopril, but the increase is not sufficient to warrant any change in dosing. Pharmacodynamics After single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril, serum ACE activity was inhibited by at least 90% from 2 to 12 hours after dosing. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remains suppressed by 85 to 93%. Administration of fosinopril to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. In studies in hypertensive patients after three months of fosinopril monotherapy, hemodynamic responses to various stimuli (isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, mental challenges) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril did not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Instead, fosinopril-induced reduction in blood pressure appears to be mediated by a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. In similar studies, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flows were all unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reductions achieved 2to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once-daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated blood pressures (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In clinical studies of various combinations that included 0 to 40 mg of fosinopril and 0 to 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, the antihypertensive effects were increased with increasing dose of either component. Peak blood pressure reductions were achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The mean reductions in seated blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) associated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 10 mg/12.5 mg after 24 hours were 9 to 18/5 to 7 mmHg greater than those associated with placebo; those associated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 20 mg/12.5 mg after 24 hours were 12 to 17/8 to 10 mmHg greater than those associated with placebo. These trough effects were 60 to 90% of the corresponding peak effects. Although hydrochlorothiazide tends to be more effective in low-renin hypertensive patients (mainly blacks), and fosinopril-like other ACE inhibitors-tends to be more effective in high-renin patients (mainly non-blacks), the effectiveness of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is independent of race, age, and gender."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action Fosinopril and fosinoprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 8 weeks had elevations of serum potassium of approximately 0.1 mEq/L. Similar patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide alone had a mean reduction in serum potassium of 0.15 mEq/L, while patients who received combined treatment with 10/12.5 mg or 20/12.5 mg of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide had reductions of 0.07 and 0.03 mEq/L, respectively. (See PRECAUTIONS ) Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin, so coadministration of an ACE inhibitor tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism The absolute absorption of fosinopril averages 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine. While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Following oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, peak plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 2.5 hours, and the extent of absorption is 50 to 80%. The reported studies of food effects on hydrochlorothiazide absorption have been inconclusive. The absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is increased by agents that reduce gastrointestinal motility. It is reported to be decreased by 50% in patients with congestive heart failure. Cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts fosinopril to its active metabolite, fosinoprilat. The time to peak plasma concentrations of fosinoprilat is about 3 hours, independent of the administered dose of fosinopril. In patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis, conversion of fosinopril to fosinoprilat may be slowed, but the extent of this conversion is unchanged. Fosinoprilat is highly protein bound (95%), but has negligible binding to cellular components of blood. The peak serum concentration and the area under the concentration-time curve of fosinoprilat is directly proportional to the administered dose of fosinopril. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but fosinoprilat does cross the placenta of pregnant animals. In humans, hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta freely, and levels in umbilical-cord blood are similar to those in the maternal circulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized. Its apparent volume of distribution is 3.6 to 7.8 L/kg, and its measured plasma protein binding is 67.9%. The drug also accumulates in red blood cells, so that whole blood levels are 1.6 to 1.8 times those measured in plasma. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat is eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the effective half-life of accumulation of fosinoprilat following multiple dosing of fosinopril sodium is 11.5 hours. Thus, steady-state concentrations of fosinoprilat should bereached after 2 or 3 doses of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets given once daily. In patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal renal function, while absorption, bioavailability, and protein binding are not appreciably altered. The clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with the degree of renal insufficiency, because the diminished renal elimination is offset by increased hepatobiliary elimination. A modest increase in plasma AUC levels (less than two times that in normals) was observed in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency, including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old).

When fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are administered concomitantly, the pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide are essentially unaffected. Serum levels of fosinoprilat are increased after several weeks of coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and fosinopril, but the increase is not sufficient to warrant any change in dosing."

(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) In using fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS : Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, tongue, or glottis occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. When involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine injection 1:1000 (0.3 to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used cautiously in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other antihypertensives. The thiazide component of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs, especially ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic-blocking drugs. The antihypertensive effects of the thiazide component may also be enhanced in the post sympathectomy patient. In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria, azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Impaired Renal Function Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used with caution in patients with severe renal disease. Thiazides may precipitate azotemia in such patients, and the effects of repeated dosing may be cumulative. When the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is inhibited by ACE inhibitors, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure, whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (including fosinopril) may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In some studies of hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine; these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy, concomitant diuretic therapy, or both. When such patients are treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some ACE-inhibitor-treated hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when the ACE inhibitor has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be required. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients (incidence probably less than once per 10,000 exposures), but more frequently (incidence possibly as great as once per 1,000 exposures) in patients with renal impairment, especially those who also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has also been associated with thiazide diuretics. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. [ see Precautions, Pediatric Use ] Intrauterine exposure to thiazide diuretics is associated with fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that occurred in adults. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg (fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide) basis, the doses used were up to 188/94 times (in rats) and 0.6/0.3 times (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. Impaired Hepatic Function Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that begins with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets who develops jaundice or marked elevation of hepatic enzymes should discontinue fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and receive appropriate medical follow-up. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Also, since the metabolism of fosinopril to fosinoprilat is normally dependent upon hepatic esterases, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of fosinopril. In a study of patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis the rate (but not the extent) of hydrolysis to fosinoprilat was reduced. In these patients the clearance of fosinoprilat was reduced, and the area under the fosinoprilat-time curve was approximately doubled. Systemic lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Derangements of Serum Electrolytes: In clinical trials of fosinopril monotherapy, hyperkalemia (serum potassium at least 10% greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia included renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Conversely, treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremic alkalosis. These disturbances have sometimes been manifest as one or more of dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Hypokalemia can also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The risk of hypokalemia is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH. The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice. Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen. Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result. Other Metabolic Disturbances: Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout may be precipitated or overt diabetes in susceptible patients. Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonreproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Information for patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing) and to take no more drug until after consulting with the prescribing physician. Pregnancy : Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension: A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. The patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the prescribing physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening. Laboratory tests Therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be interrupted for a few days before carrying out tests of parathyroid function. Fosinopril may cause false low measurement of serum digoxin levels when the DIGI-TAB\u00ae (Nuclear Medical) RIA Kit is used. The accuracy of the COAT-A-COUNT\u00ae (Diagnostic Products Corporation) kit is not affected. Drug interactions Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing Diuretics: As noted above (\"Derangements of Serum Electrolytes\"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Other: The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin . Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with betaadrenergic blockers , presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fosinopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine , but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine . The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied. By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of methenamine . Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins : Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Dual Blockade of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Fosinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide: Reproductive studies and long-term carcinogenicity studies with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been conducted. The combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay. The combination was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo. Fosinopril Sodium: No evidence of a carcinogenicity was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to rats and mice for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose was about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 20 (mice) to 40 (rats) times the maximum human dose. Neither fosinopril nor the fosinoprilat moiety was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo. In Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with up to 60 mg/kg daily. At doses 4 times higher, slight increases in pairing time were seen. This higher dose is about 125 (body surface area basis) or 600 (body weight basis) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 20 mg a day. Hydrochlorothiazide: Under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program, rats and mice received hydrochlorothiazide for two years at doses up to 100 (rats) and 600 (mice) mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, these highest doses were about 2400 times (mice) or 400 times (rats) the fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet dose of 12.5 mg, given to a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, these doses are 226 times (mice) and 82 times (rats) the fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet dose. These studies uncovered no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or female mice, but there was equivocal evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay); in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations; or in in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes; Chinese Hamster bone-marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophila sex-linked recessive lethal trait gene. Using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide of 43 to 1300 mg/mL, positive test results were obtained in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) test and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays. Using an unspecified concentration of hydrochlorothiazide, positive test results were also obtained in the Aspergillus nidulans nondisjunction assay. No adverse effects upon fertility were seen when rats and mice received dietary hydrochlorothiazide prior to mating and throughout gestation at doses up to 4 (rats) and 100 (mice) mg/kg/day. These doses are from 3.2 (body surface area basis in rats) to 400 (weight basis in mice) times greater than the dose received by a 50 kg human receiving 12.5 mg a day. Nursing mothers Both fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Geriatric use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium-hydrochlorothiazide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Derangements of Serum Electrolytes: In clinical trials of fosinopril monotherapy, hyperkalemia (serum potassium at least 10% greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia included renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Conversely, treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremic alkalosis. These disturbances have sometimes been manifest as one or more of dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting. Hypokalemia can also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis. The risk of hypokalemia is greatest in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, in patients experiencing a brisk diuresis, in patients who are receiving inadequate oral intake of electrolytes, and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or ACTH. The opposite effects of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide on serum potassium will approximately balance each other in many patients, so that no net effect upon serum potassium will be seen. In other patients, one or the other effect may be dominant. Initial and periodic determinations of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. Chloride deficits are generally mild and require specific treatment only under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., in liver disease or renal disease). Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients; appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening. In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice. Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides. In a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy, pathological changes in the parathyroid gland have been observed, with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. More serious complications of hyperparathyroidism (renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration) have not been seen. Thiazides increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, and hypomagnesemia may result. Other Metabolic Disturbances: Thiazide diuretics tend to reduce glucose tolerance and to raise serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid. These effects are usually minor, but frank gout may be precipitated or overt diabetes in susceptible patients. Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonreproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing) and to take no more drug until after consulting with the prescribing physician. Pregnancy : Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Symptomatic Hypotension: A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and that it should be reported to the prescribing physician. The patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake, excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: A patient receiving fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the prescribing physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening."

      "Laboratory tests Therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be interrupted for a few days before carrying out tests of parathyroid function. Fosinopril may cause false low measurement of serum digoxin levels when the DIGI-TAB\u00ae (Nuclear Medical) RIA Kit is used. The accuracy of the COAT-A-COUNT\u00ae (Diagnostic Products Corporation) kit is not affected."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug interactions Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing Diuretics: As noted above (\"Derangements of Serum Electrolytes\"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. Antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Other: The bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat is not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with aspirin, chlorthalidone, cimetidine, digoxin, metoclopramide, nifedipine, propranolol, propantheline, or warfarin . Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with betaadrenergic blockers , presumably because drugs of both classes lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. Interaction studies with warfarin have failed to identify any clinically important effects of fosinopril on the serum concentration or clinical effects of the anticoagulant. Insulin requirements in diabetic patients may be increased, decreased, or unchanged. Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine , but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use. Thiazides may increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine . The diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics may be reduced by concurrent administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents ; the effects (if any) of these agents on the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied. By alkalinizing the urine, hydrochlorothiazide may decrease the effectiveness of methenamine . Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins : Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Dual Blockade of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min)."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in over 660 patients with hypertension; approximately 137 of these patients were treated for more than one year. The observed adverse events were generally mild, transient, and similar to those seen with fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide taken separately. There was no relationship between the incidence of side effects and age. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, the usual duration of therapy was two months. Adverse clinical or laboratory events led to discontinuation of therapy by 4.3% of 368 placebo-treated patients and by 3.5% of 660 fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablet-treated patients. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in U.S. studies were headache (0.3%), cough (0.3%; see PRECAUTIONS ), and fatigue (0.2%). The side effects considered probably or possibly related to study drug that occurred in placebo-controlled trials in more than 2% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are shown in the table below. Reactions Possibly or Probably Drug-Related (Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Studies) Reactions Possibly or Probably Drug-Related (Incidence in Placebo-Controlled Studies) Other side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in controlled trials in 0.5% to < 2.0% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, and rarer but clinically significant events regardless of causal relationship were: General: Chest pain, weakness, fever, viral infection. Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (seen in 1.8% of fosinopril sodium hydrochlorothiazide tablet patients and 0.3% of placebo patients; no patients discontinued therapy due to orthostatic hypotension), edema, flushing, rhythm disturbance, syncope. Dermatologic: Pruritus, rash. Endocrine/Metabolic: Sexual dysfunction, change in libido, breast mass. Gastrointestinal: Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia/heartburn, abdominal pain, gastritis/esophagitis. Immunologic: Angioedema (see WARNINGS : Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema ). Musculoskeletal: Myalgia/muscle cramps. Neurologic/Psychiatric: Somnolence, depression, numbness/paresthesia. Respiratory: Sinus congestion, pharyngitis, rhinitis. Special Senses: Tinnitus. Urogenital: Urinary tract infection, urinary frequency, dysuria. Laboratory Test Abnormalities: Serum electrolytes, uric acid, glucose, magnesium, cholesterol, triglycerides, and calcium (see PRECAUTIONS ). Neutropenia. Antihypertensive monotherapy with fosinopril has been evaluated for safety in more than 1500 patients, of whom approximately 450 patients were treated for a year or more. The observed adverse events included events similar to those seen with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets; in addition, the following others have also been reported with fosinopril: Cardiovascular: Angina, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, hypotension, claudication. Dermatologic: Urticaria, photosensitivity. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, flatulence, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia. Neurologic/Psychiatric: Memory disturbance, tremor, confusion, mood change, sleep disturbance. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis, and (in two patients) a symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia. Special Senses: Vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency. Laboratory Test Abnormalities: Elevations (usually transient and minor) of BUN and creatinine have been observed, but these have not been more frequent than in parallel patients treated with placebo. The hemoglobin in fosinopril-treated patients generally decreases by an average of 0.1 g/dL, but this nonprogressive change has never been symptomatic. Leukopenia and eosinophilia have also been reported. Serum levels of liver function tests (transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin) have occasionally been found to be elevated, and these elevations have lead to discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of patients. Other risk factors for liver dysfunction have often been present in these cases; in any event the elevations generally have resolved after discontinuation of therapy with fosinopril. Other Adverse Events Reported with ACE Inhibitors Other adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include cardiac arrest; pancytopenia, hemolytic anemia; aplastic anemia; thrombocytopenia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; and a syndrome that may include one or more of arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermopathy, positive ANA titer, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated ESR. Hydrochlorothiazide has now been extensively prescribed for many years, but there has not been enough systematic collection of data to support an estimate of the frequency of the observed adverse reactions. Within organ-system groups, the reported reactions are listed here in decreasing order of severity, without regard to frequency. Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension (may be potentiated by alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics). Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic), sialadenitis, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, nausea, gastric irritation, constipation, and anorexia. Hematologic: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia. Immunologic: Necrotizing angiitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, respiratory distress (including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema), anaphylactic reactions, purpura, urticaria, rash, and photosensitivity. Metabolic: Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and hyperuricemia. Musculoskeletal: Muscle spasm. Neurologic: Vertigo, lightheadedness, transient blurred vision, headache, paresthesia, xanthopsia, weakness, and restlessness. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of \u226550,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is a certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference(PDR). In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets; treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued, and the patient should be observed. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and hypotension should be treated by established procedures. In rats, single oral doses of 2600 mg/kg of fosinopril were associated with significant lethality. In single-dose studies of hydrochlorothiazide, most rats survived doses of up to 2750 mg/kg. Both doses are more than 6000 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended daily dose of either fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide in fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Data from human overdoses of fosinopril are scanty, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. In human hydrochlorothiazide overdose, the most common signs and symptoms observed have been those of dehydration and electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia). If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinopril and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Fosinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once-daily doses of 10 to 80 mg, while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg per day. In clinical trials of fosinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using fosinopril doses of 2.5 to 40 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses at 5to 37.5 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of either component. The hazards (see WARNINGS ) of fosinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose-dependent phenomena (primarily hypokalemia) and dose-independent phenomena (e.g., pancreatitis), the former much more common than the latter. Therapy with any combination of fosinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose-independent hazards. To minimize dose-independent hazards, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy. Dose Titration by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to combination therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Dosage must be guided by clinical response; controlled clinical trials showed that the addition of 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide to 10 to 20 mg of fosinopril will typically be associated with additional reduction in seated diastolic blood pressure at 24 hours after dosing. On average, the effect of the combination of 10 mg of fosinopril with 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was similar to the effect seen with monotherapy using either 40 mg of fosinopril or 37.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Use in Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , serum creatine roughly > 3 mg/dL or 265 \u00b5mol/L), loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended. In patients with lesser degrees of renal impairment, fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used with no change in dosage."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20% to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1% to 5% as a p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and Cmax values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reduction achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50% to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after one week and the total duration of treatment was four weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of four weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a two week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10,20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 mg to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (one study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to two years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered ( see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume-and /or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume-and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.[see Precautions , Pediatric Use ]. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE Inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure . ) Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit, for Digoxin. Other Kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for three days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients )."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized.

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (excepte as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular: Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, decreased libido. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation, heartburn, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy. Immunologic: Angioedema. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema . ) Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia/muscle cramp. Nervous/Psychiatric: Memory disturbance, tremor, confusion, mood change, paresthesia, sleep disturbance, drowsiness, vertigo. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, pharyngitis, sinusitis/rhinitis, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis. A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1 %). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below. The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium, but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain. Cardiovascular: Sudden death cardiorespiratory arrest, shock (0.2%), atrial rhythm disturbance, cardiac rhythm disturbances, non anginal chest pain, edema lower extremity, hypertension, syncope, conduction disorder, bradycardia, tachycardia. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, sexual dysfunction. Gastrointestinal: Hepatomegaly, abdominal distension, decreased appetite, dry mouth, constipation, flatulence. Immunologic: Angioedema (0.2%). Musculoskeletal: Muscle ache, swelling of an extremity, weakness of an extremity. Nervous/Psychiatric: Cerebral infarction, TIA, depression, numbness, paresthesia, vertigo, behavior change, tremor. Respiratory: Abnormal vocalization, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tracheobronchitis, abnormal breathing, pleuritic chest pain. Special Senses: Vision disturbance, taste disturbance. Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and possible related reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ; With diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General . ) Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other : Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril over dosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20 month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within one hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 mg to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis and, if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Fosinopril sodium tablet, USP is the sodium salt of fosinopril USP, the ester prodrug of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinoprilat. It contains a phosphinate group capable of specific binding to the active site of angiotensin converting enzyme.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20% to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1% to 5% as a p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and Cmax values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reduction achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50% to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after one week and the total duration of treatment was four weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of four weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a two week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10,20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 mg to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (one study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to two years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered ( see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume-and /or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume-and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.[see Precautions , Pediatric Use ]. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE Inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure . ) Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit, for Digoxin. Other Kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for three days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (excepte as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular: Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, decreased libido. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation, heartburn, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy. Immunologic: Angioedema. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema . ) Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia/muscle cramp. Nervous/Psychiatric: Memory disturbance, tremor, confusion, mood change, paresthesia, sleep disturbance, drowsiness, vertigo. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, pharyngitis, sinusitis/rhinitis, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis. A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1 %). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below. The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium, but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and possible related reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ; With diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General . ) Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other : Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied. image image"

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril over dosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20 month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within one hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 mg to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis and, if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20% to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1% to 5% as a p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and Cmax values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reduction achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50% to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after one week and the total duration of treatment was four weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of four weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a two week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10,20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 mg to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (one study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to two years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered ( see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume-and /or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume-and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.[see Precautions , Pediatric Use ]. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE Inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure . ) Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit, for Digoxin. Other Kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for three days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients )."

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (excepte as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular: Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, decreased libido. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation, heartburn, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy.

Respiratory: Bronchospasm, pharyngitis, sinusitis/rhinitis, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis. A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1 %). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below. The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium, but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and possible related reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ; With diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General . ) Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other : Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied. image image"

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril over dosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20 month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within one hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 mg to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis and, if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs), and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t \u00bd for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t \u00bd was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) , the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and C max values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following 4 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after 3 months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after 1 week and the total duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a 2-week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 1, 20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (1, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (1 study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to 2 years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium tablets do not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium tablets, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ). No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure .) Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient\u2019s serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Other Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for 3 days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects: Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients )."

Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N=688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N=184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0 (0) Dizziness 1.6 (0) 0 (0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0) The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular: Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic: hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, decreased libido. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, hepatitis, dysphagia, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, flatulence, constipation, heartburn, appetite/weight change, dry mouth. Hematologic: Lymphadenopathy.

Nervous/Psychiatric: Memory disturbance, tremor, confusion, mood change, paresthesia, sleep disturbance, drowsiness, vertigo. Respiratory: Bronchospasm, pharyngitis, sinusitis/rhinitis, laryngitis/hoarseness, epistaxis. A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Heart Failure) Fosinopril Sodium (N=361) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N=373) Incidence (Discontinuation) Dizziness 11.9 (0.6) 5.4 (0.3) Cough 9.7 (0.8) 5.1 (0) Hypotension 4.4 (0.8) 0.8 (0) Musculoskeletal Pain 3.3 (0) 2.7 (0) Nausea/Vomiting 2.2 (0.6) 1.6 (0.3) Diarrhea 2.2 (0) 1.3 (0) Chest Pain (non-cardiac) 2.2 (0) 1.6 (0) Upper Respiratory Infection 2.2 (0) 1.3 (0) Orthostatic Hypotension 1.9 (0) 0.8 (0) Subjective Cardiac Rhythm Disturbance 1.4 (0.6) 0.8 (0.3) Weakness 1.4 (0.3) 0.5 (0) The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium tablets but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain. Cardiovascular: Sudden death, cardiorespiratory arrest, shock (0.2%), atrial rhythm disturbance, cardiac rhythm disturbances, non-anginal chest pain, edema lower extremity, hypertension, syncope, conduction disorder, bradycardia, tachycardia. Dermatologic: Pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, sexual dysfunction. Gastrointestinal: Hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, decreased appetite, dry mouth, constipation, flatulence.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General .) Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20-month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within 1 hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued 2 to 3 days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions .) Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least 2 hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis, and if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, are as under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20% to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1% to 5% as a p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild-to-severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . ) Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and Cmax values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reduction achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50% to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no usual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flows were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after one week and the total duration of treatment was four weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of four weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a two week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10,20,or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 mg to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (one study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to two years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Fosinopril sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this product or to any other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (e.g., a patient who has experienced angioedema with any other ACE inhibitor therapy). Do not co-administer fosinopril sodium tablets with aliskiren in patients with diabetes."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume-and /or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.[see Precautions , Pediatric Use ]. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE Inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure . ) Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient\u2019s serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit, for Digoxin. Other Kits, such as the Coat-A-Counts \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing times was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 time the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for three days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for and elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients )."

      "Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient\u2019s serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing times was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 time the maximum recommended human dose."

      "Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects, Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuation due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General, Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N=688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N=184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (excepted as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating.

A symptom-complex of cough, bronchospasm, and eosinophilia has been observed in two patients treated with fosinopril. Special Senses: Tinnitus, vision disturbance, taste disturbance, eye irritation. Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse events, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly relate or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below.

The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4 to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N=516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain. Cardiovascular: Sudden death cardiorespiratory arrest, shock (0.2%), atrial rhythm disturbance, cardiac rhythm disturbances, non anginal chest pain, edema lower extremity, hypertension, syncope, conduction disorder, bradycardia, tachycardia. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients. Dermatologic: Urticaria, rash, photosensitivity, pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, sexual dysfunction.

Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid and possible related reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions; With diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General . ) Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other : Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril over dosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determination of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20 month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within one hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics presents as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis and, if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients with Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the totally body clearance for fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), including end stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Fosinopril sodium is the sodium salt of fosinopril, the ester prodrug of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinoprilat. It contains a phosphinate group capable of specific binding to the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Fosinopril sodium is designated chemically as: L-proline, 4-cyclohexyl-1-[[[2-methyl-1-(1-oxopropoxy) propoxy] (4-phenylbutyl) phosphinyl] acetyl]-, sodium salt, trans- . Fosinopril sodium is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is soluble in water (100 mg/mL), methanol, and ethanol and slightly soluble in hexane. Its structural formula is: C 30 H 45 NNaO 7 P M.W. 585.65 Fosinopril sodium, USP, is available for oral administration as 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients include: crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and sodium stearyl fumarate."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20 to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1 to 5% as a p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis) , the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N = 20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u2265 25 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and C max values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u2265 90% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt- and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within 1 hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following 4 weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50 to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after 3 months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after 1 week and the total duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a 2 week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (1 study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to 2 years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered (see PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 25 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Symptomatic Hypotension Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy Tell female patients of childbearing age about the consequences of exposure to ACE inhibitors. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Ask patients to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Diuretics Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents increasing serum potassium Coadministration of fosinopril with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. Lithium Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Other Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for 3 days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Do not administer fosinopril sodium tablets to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Pediatric Patients )."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent preexisting renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with preexisting renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (2 patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 2 to 3 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS , General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse Events in Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N = 688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N = 184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at > 1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.

Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1%). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo-controlled trials are shown in the table below.

Potential Adverse Effects Reported With ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS , General ). Hematology In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other: Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20-month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within 1 hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued 2 to 3 days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets USP (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets USP alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets USP with potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets USP to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least 2 hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis, and if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances < 80 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment (see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure and PRECAUTIONS , Hemodialysis )."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20% to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1% to 5% as a p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed after intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p-hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. After oral administration of radiolabeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2 was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10 to 80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and Cmax values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours after single doses of 10 to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10, 20, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ). Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reduction achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8 to 9/6 to 7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50% to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after one week and the total duration of treatment was four weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of four weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a two week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10,20, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10, 20, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours after dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 mg to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (one study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to two years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using fosinopril sodium, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema )."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered ( see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Intestinal Angioedema: Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume-and /or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume-and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and, rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia.[see Precautions , Pediatric Use ]. No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. When fosinopril was given to pregnant rats at doses about 80 to 250 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, three similar orofacial malformations and one fetus with situs inversus were observed among the offspring. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE Inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function: Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis, the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure . ) Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit, for Digoxin. Other Kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for three days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4 to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS: General , Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.2 to 1.0% of patients (excepte as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled or uncontrolled clinical trials (N=1479) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General: Chest pain, edema, weakness, excessive sweating. Cardiovascular: Angina/myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, rhythm disturbances, palpitations, hypotension, syncope, flushing, claudication. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with fosinopril monotherapy. Hypotension or orthostatic hypotension was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.1% of patients.

Urogenital: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium -treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1 %). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension.

Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ; With diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. (See PRECAUTIONS: General . ) Hematology: In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other : Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril over dosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril. There is a published report of a 20 month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within one hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 mg to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized. (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatrics In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets USP in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis and, if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia early in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Renal Impairment: In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.

      "DESCRIPTION Fosinopril sodium tablets, USP are the sodium salt of fosinopril, the ester prodrug of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, fosinoprilat. It contains a phosphinate group capable of specific binding to the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Fosinopril sodium is designated chemically as: L-proline, 4-cyclohexyl- 1-[[[2-methyl-1-(1-oxopropoxy)propoxy](4-phenylbutyl)phosphinyl]acetyl]-, sodium salt, trans-. Fosinopril sodium, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is soluble in water (100 mg/mL), methanol, and ethanol and slightly soluble in hexane. Its structural formula is: Empirical formula: C 30 H 45 NNa0 7 P Molecular weight: 585.65 Fosinopril Sodium, USP is available for oral administration as 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients include: carnauba wax, crospovidone, lactose anhydrous, microcrystalline cellulose, and zinc stearate. \"Image Description\""

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In animals and humans, fosinopril sodium is hydrolyzed by esterases to the pharmacologically active form, fosinoprilat, a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In 647 hypertensive patients treated with fosinopril alone for an average of 29 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L were observed. Similar increases were observed among all patients treated with fosinopril, including those receiving concomitant diuretic therapy. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of fosinopril sodium remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which fosinopril sodium lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fosinopril sodium has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although fosinopril sodium was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to ACE inhibitor monotherapy than non-black patients. In patients with heart failure, the beneficial effects of fosinopril sodium are thought to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme produces decreases in both preload and afterload. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration, fosinopril (the prodrug) is absorbed slowly. The absolute absorption of fosinopril averaged 36% of an oral dose. The primary site of absorption is the proximal small intestine (duodenum/jejunum). While the rate of absorption may be slowed by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract, the extent of absorption of fosinopril is essentially unaffected. Fosinoprilat is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.4%), has a relatively small volume of distribution, and has negligible binding to cellular components in blood. After single and multiple oral doses, plasma levels, areas under plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs), and peak concentrations (C maxs ) are directly proportional to the dose of fosinopril. Times to peak concentrations are independent of dose and are achieved in approximately 3 hours. After an oral dose of radiolabeled fosinopril, 75% of radioactivity in plasma was present as active fosinoprilat, 20% to 30% as a glucuronide conjugate of fosinoprilat, and 1% to 5% asap-hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat. Since fosinoprilat is not biotransformed alter intravenous administration, fosinopril, not fosinoprilat, appears to be the precursor for the glucuronide and p -hydroxy metabolites. In rats, the p -hydroxy metabolite of fosinoprilat is as potent an inhibitor of ACE as fosinoprilat; the glucuronide conjugate is devoid of ACE inhibitory activity. After intravenous administration, fosinoprilat was eliminated approximately equally by the liver and kidney. Alter oral administration of radio labeled fosinopril, approximately half of the absorbed dose is excreted in the urine and the remainder is excreted in the feces. In two studies involving healthy subjects, the mean body clearance of intravenous fosinoprilat was between 26 mL/min and 39 mL/min. In healthy subjects, the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of an intravenous dose of radiolabeled fosinoprilat is approximately 12 hours. In hypertensive patients with normal renal and hepatic function, who received repeated doses of fosinopril, the effective t 1/2 , for accumulation of fosinoprilat averaged 11.5 hours. In patients with heart failure, the effective t 1/2, was 14 hours. In patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance 10-80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably from normal, because of the large contribution of hepatobiliary elimination. In patients with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . Fosinopril is not well dialyzed. Clearance of fosinoprilat by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis averages 2% and 7%, respectively, of urea clearances. In patients with hepatic insufficiency (alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis), the extent of hydrolysis of fosinopril is not appreciably reduced, although the rate of hydrolysis may be slowed; the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately one-half of that in patients with normal hepatic function. In elderly (male) subjects (65 to 74 years old) with clinically normal renal and hepatic function, there appear to be no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters for fosinoprilat compared to those of younger subjects (20 to 35 years old). In pediatric patients , (N=20) age 6 to 16 years, with glomerular filtration rate \u226525 mL/min, given a single dose of fosinopril (0.3 mg/kg given as solution), the mean AUC and C max values of fosinoprilat (the active form of fosinopril) were similar to those seen in healthy adults receiving 20 mg (about 0.3 mg/kg for a 70 kg adult) of fosinopril as a solution. The terminal elimination half-life of fosinoprilat in pediatric patients was 11 to 13 hours, also similar to that observed in adults. Fosinoprilat was found to cross the placenta of pregnant animals. Studies in animals indicate that fosinopril and fosinoprilat do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Serum ACE activity was inhibited by \u226590% at 2 to 12 hours alter single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg of fosinopril. At 24 hours, serum ACE activity remained suppressed by 85%, 93%, and 93% in the 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg dose groups, respectively. Hypertension Adult : Administration of fosinopril sodium tablets to patients with mild to moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt-and/or volume-depleted (see WARNINGS ) . Use of fosinopril sodium in combination with thiazide diuretics gives a blood pressure-lowering effect greater than that seen with either agent alone. Following oral administration of single doses of 10 mg to 40 mg, fosinopril sodium lowered blood pressure within one hour, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 6 hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours. Following four weeks of monotherapy in placebo-controlled trials in patients with mild to moderate hypertension, once daily doses of 20 mg to 80 mg lowered supine or seated systolic and diastolic blood pressures 24 hours after dosing by an average of 8-9/6-7 mmHg more than placebo. The trough effect was about 50% to 60% of the peak diastolic response and about 80% of the peak systolic response. In most trials, the antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium increased during the first several weeks of repeated measurements. The antihypertensive effect of fosinopril sodium has been shown to continue during long-term therapy for at least 2 years. Abrupt withdrawal of fosinopril sodium has not resulted in a rapid increase in blood pressure. Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials combining fosinopril sodium with a calcium channel blocker or a loop diuretic has indicated no unusual drug-drug interactions. Other ACE inhibitors have had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE inhibitors are generally less effective in blacks than in non-blacks. The effectiveness of fosinopril sodium was not influenced by age, sex, or weight. In hemodynamic studies in hypertensive patients, after three months of therapy, responses (changes in BP, heart rate, cardiac index, and PVR) to various stimuli (e.g., isometric exercise, 45\u00b0 head-up tilt, and mental challenge) were unchanged compared to baseline, suggesting that fosinopril sodium does not affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reduction in systemic blood pressure appears to have been mediated by a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance without reflex cardiac effects. Similarly, renal, splanchnic, cerebral, and skeletal muscle blood flow were unchanged compared to baseline, as was glomerular filtration rate. Pediatric : Reduction of blood pressure with low (0.1 mg/kg), medium (0.3 mg/kg) and high (0.6 mg/kg) target doses of once-daily fosinopril was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 252 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age with hypertension or high-normal blood pressure. Fosinopril doses in the medium and high dose groups were titrated to target doses after 1 week and the total duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The maximum dose studied was 40 mg once daily. At the end of 4 weeks of treatment, the mean reductions from baseline in trough systolic blood pressure were similar in all three dose groups. Withdrawal of fosinopril treatment resulted in an increase in blood pressure towards baseline over a 2-week period. Fosinopril was generally well tolerated. Heart Failure In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 179 patients with heart failure, all receiving diuretics and some receiving digoxin, were administered single doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of fosinopril sodium or placebo. Doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of fosinopril sodium resulted in acute decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and mean arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (afterload). One hundred fifty-five of these patients were re-randomized to once daily therapy with fosinopril sodium (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) for an additional 10 weeks. Hemodynamic measurements made 24 hours alter dosing showed (relative to baseline) continued reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac index and stroke volume for the 20 mg and 40 mg dose groups. No tachyphylaxis was seen. Fosinopril sodium was studied in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 to 24 week trials including a total of 734 patients with heart failure, with fosinopril sodium doses from 10 to 40 mg daily. Concomitant therapy in 2 of these 3 trials included diuretics and digitalis; in the third trial patients were receiving only diuretics. All 3 trials showed statistically significant benefits of fosinopril sodium therapy, compared to placebo, in one or more of the following: exercise tolerance (one study), symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (2 studies), NYHA classification (2 studies), hospitalization for heart failure (2 studies), study withdrawals for worsening heart failure (2 studies), and/or need for supplemental diuretics (2 studies). Favorable effects were maintained for up to two years. Effects of fosinopril sodium on long-term mortality in heart failure have not been evaluated. The once daily dosage for the treatment of congestive heart failure was the only dosage regimen used during clinical trial development and was determined by the measurement of hemodynamic responses."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics. Fosinopril sodium tablets are indicated in the management of heart failure as adjunctive therapy when added to conventional therapy including diuretics with or without digitalis (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) . In using fosinopril sodium tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that fosinopril sodium tablets do not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS ). In considering use of fosinopril sodium tablets, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions, Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema) ."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including fosinopril sodium) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. If laryngeal stridor or angioedema of the face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or extremities occurs, treatment with fosinopril sodium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis, or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) should be promptly administered ( see PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS) . Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure: Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Fosinopril sodium can cause symptomatic hypotension. Like other ACE inhibitors, fosinopril has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Volume and/or salt depletion should be corrected before initiating therapy with fosinopril sodium. In patients with heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia, and (rarely) with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, fosinopril sodium therapy should be started under close medical supervision; they should be followed closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of fosinopril or diuretic is increased. Consideration should be given to reducing the diuretic dose in patients with normal or low blood pressure who have been treated vigorously with diuretics or who are hyponatremic. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position, and, if necessary, treated with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Fosinopril sodium treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients, but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma. Available data from clinical trials of fosinopril are insufficient to show that fosinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Monitoring of white blood cell counts should be considered in patients with collagen-vascular disease, especially if the disease is associated with impaired renal function. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue fosinopril as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue fosinopril, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to fosinopril for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ). No teratogenic effects of fosinopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 180 times (in rats) and one time (in rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including fosinopril sodium tablets, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of ACE inhibitor and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when fosinopril sodium has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of fosinopril sodium and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Impaired renal function decreases total clearance of fosinoprilat and approximately doubles AUC. In general, no adjustment of dosing is needed. However, patients with heart failure and severely reduced renal function may be more sensitive to the hemodynamic effects (e.g., hypotension) of ACE inhibition (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Hyperkalemia : In clinical trials, hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 10% above the upper limit of normal) has occurred in approximately 2.6% of hypertensive patients receiving fosinopril sodium. In most cases, these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. In clinical trials, 0.1% of patients (two patients) were discontinued from therapy due to an elevated serum potassium. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with fosinopril sodium tablets (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). Cough : Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Impaired Liver Function : Since fosinopril is primarily metabolized by hepatic and gut wall esterases to its active moiety, fosinoprilat, patients with impaired liver function could develop elevated plasma levels of unchanged fosinopril. In a study in patients with alcoholic or biliary cirrhosis. the extent of hydrolysis was unaffected, although the rate was slowed. In these patients, the apparent total body clearance of fosinoprilat was decreased and the plasma AUC approximately doubled. Surgery/Anesthesia : In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, fosinopril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Information for Patients Angioedema : Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, can occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, especially following the first dose. Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx, mucous membranes, and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions, Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema ). Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur, especially during the first days of therapy, and it should be reported to a physician. Patients should be told that if syncope occurs, fosinopril sodium should be discontinued until the physician has been consulted. All patients should be cautioned that inadequate fluid intake or excessive perspiration, diarrhea, or vomiting can lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure, with the same consequences of lightheadedness and possible syncope. Hyperkalemia : Patients should be told not to use potassium supplements or salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting the physician. Neutropenia : Patients should be told to promptly report any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which could be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy : Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to fosinopril during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Diuretics : Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium : Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co-administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Antacids : In a clinical pharmacology study, co-administration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administered alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours. Gold : Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium. Other : Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by co-administration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered. In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed. Drug/Laboratory Test Interaction Fosinopril may cause a false low measurement of serum digoxin levels with the Digi-Tab \u00ae RIA Kit for Digoxin. Other kits, such as the Coat-A-Count \u00ae RIA Kit, may be used. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was found when fosinopril was given in the diet to mice and rats for up to 24 months at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. On a body weight basis, the highest dose in mice and rats is about 250 times the maximum human dose of 80 mg, assuming a 50 kg subject. On a body surface area basis, in mice, this dose is 20 times the maximum human dose; in rats, this dose is 40 times the maximum human dose. Male rats given the highest dose level had a slightly higher incidence of mesentery/omentum lipomas. Neither fosinopril nor the active fosinoprilat was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test, the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, or a mitotic gene conversion assay. Fosinopril was also not genotoxic in a mouse micronucleus test in vivo and a mouse bone marrow cytogenetic assay in vivo . In the Chinese hamster ovary cell cytogenetic assay, fosinopril increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations when tested without metabolic activation at a concentration that was toxic to the cells. However, there was no increase in chromosomal aberrations at lower drug concentrations without metabolic activation or at any concentration with metabolic activation. There were no adverse reproductive effects in male and female rats treated with 15 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg daily. On a body weight basis, the high dose of 60 mg/kg is about 38 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose. There was no effect on pairing time prior to mating in rats until a daily dose of 240 mg/kg, a toxic dose, was given; at this dose, a slight increase in pairing time was observed. On a body weight basis, this dose is 150 times the maximum recommended human dose. On a body surface area basis, this dose is 24 times the maximum recommended human dose. Pregnancy Nursing Mothers Ingestion of 20 mg daily for three days resulted in detectable levels of fosinoprilat in breast milk. Fosinopril sodium should not be administered to nursing mothers. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fosinopril sodium did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to fosinopril sodium tablets: If oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. Removal of fosinopril, which crosses the placenta, from the neonatal circulation is not significantly accelerated by these means. The antihypertensive effects of fosinopril have been evaluated in a double-blind study in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Hypertension ). The pharmacokinetics of fosinopril have been evaluated in pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism ). Fosinopril was generally well tolerated and adverse effects were similar to those described in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS , Pediatric Patients )."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Fosinopril sodium has been evaluated for safety in more than 2,100 individuals in hypertension and heart failure trials, including approximately 530 patients treated for a year or more. Generally, adverse events were mild and transient, and their frequency was not prominently related to dose within the recommended daily dosage range. Hypertension In placebo-controlled clinical trials (688 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was two to three months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event were 4.1% and 1.1% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reasons (0.4% to 0.9%) were headache, elevated transaminases, fatigue, cough (see PRECAUTIONS, General, Cough ), diarrhea, and nausea and vomiting. During clinical trials with any fosinopril sodium regimen, the incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u226565 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium alone and at least as frequent on fosinopril sodium as on placebo in placebo-controlled clinical trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse events In Placebo-Controlled Trials (Hypertension) Fosinopril Sodium (N=688) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N=184) Incidence (Discontinuation) Cough 2.2 (0.4) 0.0 (0.0) Dizziness 1.6 (0.0) 0.0 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 1.2 (0.4) 0.5 (0.0) The following events were also seen at >1% on fosinopril sodium tablets but occurred in the placebo group at a greater rate: headache, diarrhea, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.

Urogenita l: Renal insufficiency, urinary frequency. Heart Failure In placebo-controlled clinical trials (361 fosinopril sodium-treated patients), the usual duration of therapy was 3 to 6 months. Discontinuations due to any clinical or laboratory adverse event, except for heart failure, were 8.0% and 7.5% in fosinopril sodium-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most frequent reason for discontinuation of fosinopril sodium was angina pectoris (1.1 %). Significant hypotension after the first dose of fosinopril sodium occurred in 14/590 (2.4%) of patients; 5/590 (0.8%) patients discontinued due to first dose hypotension. Clinical adverse events probably or possibly related or of uncertain relationship to therapy, occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with fosinopril sodium and at least as common as the placebo group, in placebo controlled trials are shown in the table below. Clinical Adverse events In Placebo-Controlled Trials (Heart Failure) Fosinopril Sodium (N=361) Incidence (Discontinuation) Placebo (N=373) Incidence (Discontinuation) Dizziness 11.9 (0.6) 5.4 (0.3) Cough 9.7 (0.8) 5.1 (0.0) Hypertension 4.4 (0.8) 0.8 (0.0) Musculoskeletal Pain 3.3 (0.0) 2.7 (0.0) Nausea/Vomiting 2.2 (0.6) 1.6 (0.3) Diarrhea 2.2 (0.0) 1.3 (0.0) Chest Pain (non-cardiac) 2.2 (0.0) 1.6 (0.0) Upper Respiratory Infection 2.2 (0.0) 1.3 (0.0) Orthostatic Hypotension 1.9 (0.0) 0.8 (0.0) Subjective Cardiac Rhythym Disturbance 1.4 (0.6) 0.8 (0.3) Weakness 1.4 (0.3) 0.5 (0.0) The following events also occurred at a rate of 1% or more on fosinopril sodium but occurred on placebo more often: fatigue, dyspnea, headache, rash, abdominal pain, muscle cramp, angina pectoris, edema, and insomnia. The incidence of adverse events in the elderly (\u2265 65 years old) was similar to that seen in younger patients. Other clinical events probably or possibly related, or of uncertain relationship to therapy occurring in 0.4% to 1.0% of patients (except as noted) treated with fosinopril sodium in controlled clinical trials (N; 516) and less frequent, clinically significant events include (listed by body system): General : Fever, influenza, weight gain, hyperhidrosis, sensation of cold, fall, pain. Cardiovascular : Sudden death, cardiorespiratory arrest, shock (0.2%), atrial rhythm disturbance, cardiac rhythm disturbances, non anginal chest pain, edema lower extremity, hypertension, syncope, conduction disorder, bradycardia, tachycardia. Dermatologic: pruritus. Endocrine/Metabolic: Gout, sexual dysfunction. Gastrointestinal: Hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, decreased appetite, dry mouth, constipation, flatulence.

Respiratory: Abnormal vocalization, rhinitis, sinus abnormality, tracheobronchitis, abnormal breathing, pleuritic chest pain. Special Senses: Vision disturbance, taste disturbance. Urogenital: Abnormal urination, kidney pain. Potential Adverse Effects Reported with ACE Inhibitors Body as a whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS, Hemodialysis ). Other medically important adverse effects reported with ACE inhibitors include: Cardiac arrest; eosinophilic pneumonitis; neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia; acute renal failure; hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic); symptomatic hyponatremia; bullous pemphigus, exfoliative dermatitis; a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive ANA, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, or an elevated ESR. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Serum Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia, (see PRECAUTIONS ); hyponatremia, (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions, Diuretics ). BUN/Serum Creatinine: Elevations, usually transient and minor, of BUN or serum creatinine have been observed. ln placebo-controlled clinical trials, there were no significant differences in the number of patients experiencing increases in serum creatinine (outside the normal range or 1.33 times the pre-treatment value) between the fosinopril and placebo treatment groups. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure by any antihypertensive therapy can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, and in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine (see PRECAUTIONS, General ). Hematology : In controlled trials, a mean hemoglobin decrease of 0.1 g/dL was observed in fosinopril-treated patients. In individual patients decreases in hemoglobin or hematocrit were usually transient, small, and not associated with symptoms. No patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Other : Neutropenia (see WARNINGS ), leukopenia and eosinophilia. Liver Function Tests: Elevations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have been reported. Fosinopril therapy was discontinued because of serum transaminase elevations in 0.7% of patients. In the majority of cases, the abnormalities were either present at baseline or were associated with other etiologic factors. In those cases which were possibly related to fosinopril therapy, the elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy. Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adult patients with hypertension. The long-term effects of fosinopril sodium on growth and development have not been studied."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Oral doses of fosinopril at 2600 mg/kg in rats were associated with significant lethality. Human overdoses of fosinopril have not been reported, but the most common manifestation of human fosinopril overdosage is likely to be hypotension. Laboratory determinations of serum levels of fosinoprilat and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of fosinopril overdose. No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of fosinopril and its metabolites. Fosinoprilat is poorly removed from the body by both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote in the setting of fosinopril overdose, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities. Because the hypotensive effect of fosinopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, it is reasonable to treat fosinopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution. No adverse clinical events were reported in 23 pediatric patients, age 6 months to 6 years, given a single 0.3 mg/kg oral dose of fosinopril sodium. There is a published report of a 20-month-old female, weighing 12 kg, who ingested approximately 200 mg fosinopril sodium. After receiving gastric lavage and activated charcoal within one hour of the ingestion, she made an uneventful recovery."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Adults The recommended initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets is 10 mg once a day, both as monotherapy and when the drug is added to a diuretic. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response at peak (2 to 6 hours) and trough (about 24 hours after dosing) blood levels. The usual dosage range needed to maintain a response at trough is 20 mg to 40 mg but some patients appear to have a further response to 80 mg. In some patients treated with once daily dosing, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. If trough response is inadequate, dividing the daily dose should be considered. If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to increases of serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets. To reduce the likelihood of hypotension, the diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued two to three days prior to beginning therapy with fosinopril sodium tablets (see WARNINGS ). Then, if blood pressure is not controlled with fosinopril sodium tablets alone, diuretic therapy should be resumed. If diuretic therapy cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium tablets should be used with careful medical supervision for several hours and until blood pressure has stabilized (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients and Drug Interactions ). Since concomitant administration of fosinopril sodium tablets with potassium supplements, or potassium containing salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases in serum potassium, they should be used with caution (see PRECAUTIONS ). Pediatric Patients In children, doses of fosinopril sodium tablets between 0.1 mg/kg and 0.6 mg/kg have been studied and shown to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects ). Based on this, the recommended dose of fosinopril sodium tablets in children weighing more than 50 kg is 5 mg to 10 mg once per day as monotherapy. An appropriate dosage strength is not available for children weighing less than 50 kg. Heart Failure Digitalis is not required for fosinopril sodium tablets to manifest improvements in exercise tolerance and symptoms. Most placebo-controlled clinical trial experience has been with both digitalis and diuretics present as background therapy. The usual starting dose of fosinopril sodium tablets should be 10 mg once daily. Following the initial dose of fosinopril sodium tablets, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours for the presence of hypotension or orthostasis, and if present, until blood pressure stabilizes. An initial dose of 5 mg is preferred in heart failure patients with moderate to severe renal failure or those who have been vigorously diuresed. Dosage should be increased, over a several week period, to a dose that is maximal and tolerated but not exceeding 40 mg once daily. The usual effective dosage range is 20 mg to 40 mg once daily. The appearance of hypotension, orthostasis, or azotemia easy in dose titration should not preclude further careful dose titration. Consideration should be given to reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic. For Hypertensive or Heart Failure Patients With Rena/Impairment : In patients with impaired renal function, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat is approximately 50% slower than in patients with normal renal function. Since hepatobiliary elimination partially compensates for diminished renal elimination, the total body clearance of fosinoprilat does not differ appreciably with any degree of renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances <80 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), including end-stage renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). This relative constancy of body clearance of active fosinoprilat, resulting from the dual route of elimination, permits use of the usual dose in patients with any degree of renal impairment.
