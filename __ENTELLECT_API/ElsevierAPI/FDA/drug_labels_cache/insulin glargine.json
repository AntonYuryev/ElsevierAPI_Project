      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, glycemic control, type of diabetes, and prior insulin use. ( 2.2 ) Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 2.3 ) and how to change to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulins. ( 2.4 ) Closely monitor glucose when switching to Insulin Glargine-yfgn and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is Insulin Glargine-yfgn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Visually inspect Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials and prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Administer Insulin Glargine-yfgn subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) ]. Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix Insulin Glargine-yfgn with any other insulin or solution. The Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. Use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Administer Insulin Glargine-yfgn subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn based on the patient\u2019s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine-yfgn must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. 2.3 Initiation of Insulin Glargine-yfgn Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Switching to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulin therapies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 ) ]. When switching from: Once-daily insulin glargine 300 units/mL to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine, 300 units/mL dosage that is being discontinued. Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued. Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen, insulin syringe, or needle between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitant drugs, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia due to medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin Glargine-yfgn. Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 ) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine-yfgn Prefilled Pen, Insulin Syringe, or Needle Between Patients Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials must never re-use or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including insulin glargine products. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. The long-acting effect of insulin glargine products may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of insulin glargine products may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7) ]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine-yfgn and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including insulin glargine products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Glargine-yfgn; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Insulin Glargine-yfgn is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine products or one of the excipients. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including insulin glargine products, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine-yfgn, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with insulin glargine products include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2,327 patients with type 1 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies A, B, C, and D [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 39 years, 54% were male and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 kg/m 2 . Ninety-seven percent were White, 2% were Black or African American and less than 1% were Asian. Approximately 3% of the patients in studies B and C were Hispanic. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1,563 patients with type 2 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies E, F, and G [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 59 years, 58% were male, and the mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2 . Eighty-seven percent were White, 8% were Black or African American, and 3% were Asian. Approximately 9% of patients in Study F were Hispanic. The frequencies of adverse reactions during insulin glargine clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 1,257) NPH,% (n = 1,070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body system not specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 849) NPH,% (n = 714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body system not specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 10% in a 5-Year Study of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 514) NPH,% (n = 503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in a 28-Week Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 174) NPH,% (n = 175) Infection Body system not specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with insulin glargine. Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (\u2264 56 mg/dL in the 5-year study and \u2264 36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN study) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Percentages of insulin glargine-treated adult patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult studies with type 1 diabetes.

Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Study ORIGIN Study Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years Insulin Glargine n = 6231 Standard Care n = 6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking insulin glargine products have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including insulin glargine products, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulin including insulin glargine products and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Hypersensitivity Reactions Local Reactions Patients taking insulin glargine experienced injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of injection site pain in insulin glargine-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock have occurred with insulin, including insulin glargine products and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other insulin glargine products may be misleading. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In clinical studies of insulin glargine, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of insulin glargine products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which rapid-acting insulins and other insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine products. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine products during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine products and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine products and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), on a mg/kg basis. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day on a mg/kg basis, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine products in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Insulin Glargine-yfgn, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Glargine-yfgn or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine-yfgn to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus have been established. Use of Insulin Glargine-yfgn for this indication is supported by Insulin Glargine-yfgn's approval as a biosimilar to insulin glargine and evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study D) in 174 insulin glargine-treated pediatric patients aged 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus and from adequate and well-controlled studies of insulin glargine in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2)] . In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in studies with type 1 diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with insulin glargine, 15% (n=316) were \u2265 65 years of age and 2% (n=42) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of insulin glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine-yfgn is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dosage increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of insulin glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine-yfgn is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dosage increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.6) ]. Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine-yfgn is a long-acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a recombinant yeast strain, Pichia pastoris . Insulin glargine-yfgn differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C-terminus of the B-chain. Insulin glargine-yfgn has a molecular weight of 6063 Da. Insulin Glargine-yfgn is a sterile, clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous use in a 10 mL multiple-dose vial and a 3 mL single-patient-use prefilled pen. Prefilled Pen and Vial: Each mL contains 100 units of insulin glargine-yfgn and the inactive ingredients: glycerol (20 mg), metacresol (2.7 mg), zinc chloride (content adjusted to provide 30 mcg zinc ion), and Water for Injection, USP. The vial also contains polysorbate 20 (20 mcg). The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. Insulin Glargine-yfgn has a pH of approximately 4.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine products, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to > 24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for insulin glargine. Figure 1: Glucose-Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including insulin glargine products, may vary between patients and within the same patient. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Elimination Metabolism A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des- 30 B -Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation. Specific Populations Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n = 3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n = 349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between insulin glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of insulin glargine given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Tables 9-11). In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with insulin glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Study A, n = 585, Study B n = 534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. In Study A, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (99%) and 56% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 24.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. In Study B, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (95%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 19 years. In these 3 adult studies, insulin glargine and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 11.7 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 52% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 18.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 5 years.

The average age was 60 years old. The majority of patients were White (93%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 29.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin glargine administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11). The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in insulin glargine and NPH insulin treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in adult patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications (n = 518), a basal-bolus regimen of insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59 years. The majority of patients were White (81%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. Insulin glargine had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily insulin glargine or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of insulin glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started insulin glargine at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the insulin glargine and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose \u2264 100 mg/dL. After the insulin glargine or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted, other anti-diabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55 years. The majority of patients were White (85%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The insulin glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the insulin glargine group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 41 years. All patients were White (100%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. Insulin glargine administered at pre-breakfast or at pre-dinner (both once daily) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to insulin glargine injection regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the insulin glargine-breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two groups (pre-dinner, bedtime) discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of once daily insulin glargine administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 61 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as insulin glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12).

Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 years) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations and indicate similarity of insulin glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. In this study, the numbers of retinal adverse events reported for insulin glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of insulin glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults \u2265 50 years of age with: Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that insulin glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints: The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients were randomized to either insulin glargine (N = 6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of \u2264 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N = 6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m 2 . Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors. Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of patients randomized to insulin glargine and standard care respectively at end of study. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the study was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the insulin glargine and standard care group respectively. The median dose of insulin glargine at end of study was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to insulin glargine were using insulin glargine at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the insulin glargine group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

If you have any questions about your pen or about diabetes, ask your healthcare provider, or call Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 Extra Items You Will Need A new sterile needle (see Step 2 ). An alcohol swab. A puncture-resistant container for used needles and pens. (See \" Throwing your pen away\" ) Places to inject Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Get to know your pen Step 1: Check your pen Take a new pen out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before you inject. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 1A Check the name and expiration date on the label of your pen. Make sure you have the correct insulin (See Figure a). Do not use your pen after the expiration date (See Figure b). 1B Pull off the pen cap (See Figure c) . 1C Check that the insulin is clear (See Figure d). Do not use the pen if the insulin looks cloudy, colored or contains particles. 1D Wipe the rubber seal with an alcohol swab (See Figure e). If you have other injector pens: Making sure you have the correct medicine is especially important if you have other injector pens. Step 2: Attach a new needle Do not reuse needles. Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, contamination, and infection. Only use needles that are compatible for use with Insulin Glargine-yfgn, such as Embecta Ultra fine 2A Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal (See Figure f) . 2B Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not over-tighten (See Figure g). 2C Pull off the outer needle cap (See Figure h) . Keep this for later. 2D Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away (See Figure i). Handling needles Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Step 3: Do a safety test Always do a safety test before each injection to: Check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly . Make sure that you get the correct Insulin Glargine-yfgn dose. 3A Select 2 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark (See Figure j). 3B Press the injection button all the way in (See Figure k). When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly. If no insulin appears: You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin. If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ), then repeat the safety test ( Step 3 ). Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. If you see air bubbles: You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. Step 4: Select the dose Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen. 4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to \u201c0\u201d (See Figure l) . 4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose (See Figure m). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left. If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and use a new pen to complete your dose. How to read the dose window Even numbers are shown in line with dose pointer (See Figure n). Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers (See Figure o). Units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in your pen: Your pen contains a total of 300 units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than 1 dose. You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale. Step 5: Injecting Your Insulin Glargine-yfgn Dose If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. See the section below for help. Choose a place to inject as shown in the section \"Places to Inject\" Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider (See Figure p) . Do not touch the injection button yet. 5C Place your thumb on the injection button. Slowly press all the way in and hold (see Figure q). Do not press hard . Do not press at an angle. Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 5D Keep the injection button held in and when you see \"0\" in the dose window, slowly count to 10 (See Figure r) . This will make sure you get your full dose. 5E After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin. If you find it hard to press the button in: Change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ) then do a safety test (see Step 3 ). If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. Step 6: Remove the needle Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Do not put the inner needle cap back on. 6A Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap. Then push firmly on (See Figure s) . \u2022 The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. 6B Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle (See Figure t) . Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. 6C Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see \u201cThrowing your pen away\u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use). (See Figure u) . 6D Put your pen cap back on (See Figure v). Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. Storing the Insulin Glargine-yfgn Pen Before first use: \u2022 Keep new pens in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) . \u2022 Do not freeze.

( 2.2 ) \u2022 Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes (2.3) and how to change to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulins. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Closely monitor glucose when switching to Insulin Glargine-yfgn and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is SEMGLEE (insulin glargine-yfgn) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. \u2022 Visually inspect Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials and prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. \u2022 Administer Insulin Glargine-yfgn subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . \u2022 During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. \u2022 Do not dilute or mix Insulin Glargine-yfgn with any other insulin or solution. \u2022 The Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. \u2022 Use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions \u2022 Administer Insulin Glargine-yfgn subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. \u2022 Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn based on the patient\u2019s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . \u2022 In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine-yfgn must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. 2.3 Initiation of Insulin Glargine-yfgn Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Switching to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . When switching from: \u2022 Once-daily insulin glargine 300 units/mL to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine, 300 units/mL dosage that is being discontinued. \u2022 Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued. \u2022 Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Never share an Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen, insulin syringe, or needle between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitant drugs, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia due to medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin Glargine-yfgn. Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine-yfgn Prefilled Pen, Insulin Syringe, or Needle Between Patients Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials must never re-use or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including insulin glargine products. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. The long-acting effect of insulin glargine products may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of insulin glargine products may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine-yfgn and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including insulin glargine products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Glargine-yfgn; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Insulin Glargine-yfgn is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine products or one of the excipients. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including insulin glargine products, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine-yfgn, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2,327 patients with type 1 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies A, B, C, and D [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 39 years. 54% were male, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 Kg/m2. Ninety-seven percent were White, 2% were Black or African American and less than 1% were Asian. Approximately 3% of the patients in studies B and C were Hispanic. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1,563 patients with type 2 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies E, F, and G [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 59 years. 58% were male, and mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2 . Eighty-seven percent were White, 8% were Black or African American and 3% were Asian. Approximately 9% of patients in Study F were Hispanic. The frequencies of adverse reactions during insulin glargine clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 1,257) NPH, % (n = 1,070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body system not specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 849) NPH, % (n = 714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body system not specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 10% in a 5-Year Study of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 514) NPH, % (n = 503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in a 28-Week Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 174) NPH, % (n = 175) Infection Body system not specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with insulin glargine. Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (\u2264 56 mg/dL in the 5-year study and \u2264 36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN study) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Percentages of insulin glargine-treated adult patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult studies with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine n = 292 NPH n = 293 Insulin Glargine n = 264 NPH n = 270 Insulin Glargine n = 310 NPH n = 309 Insulin Glargine n = 174 NPH n = 175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine n = 289 NPH n = 281 Insulin Glargine n = 259 NPH n = 259 Insulin Glargine n = 513 NPH n = 504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Study ORIGIN Study Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years Insulin Glargine n = 6231 Standard Care n = 6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking insulin glargine products have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including insulin glargine products, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulin including insulin glargine products and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Hypersensitivity Reactions Local Reactions Patients taking insulin glargine experienced injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of injection site pain in insulin glargine-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock have occurred with insulin, including insulin glargine products and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other insulin glargine products may be misleading. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In clinical studies of insulin glargine, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of insulin glargine products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which rapid-acting insulins and other insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine products. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine products during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine products and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine products and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), on a mg/kg basis. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day on a mg/kg basis, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine products in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Insulin Glargine-yfgn, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Glargine-yfgn or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine - yfgn to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus have been established. Use of Insulin Glargine for this indication is supported by Insulin Glargine - yfgn\u2019s approval as a biosimilar to insulin glargine and evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study D) in 174 insulin glargine-treated pediatric patients aged 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and from adequate and well-controlled studies of insulin glargine in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in studies with type 1 diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with insulin glargine, 15% (n = 316) were \u2265 65 years of age and 2% (n = 42) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of insulin glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine-yfgn is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dosage increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine-yfgn is a long-acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a recombinant yeast strain, Pichia pastoris. Insulin glargine-yfgn differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C-terminus of the B-chain. Insulin glargine-yfgn has a molecular weight of 6063 Da. Insulin Glargine-yfgn is a sterile, clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous use in a 10 mL multiple-dose vial and a 3 mL single-patient-use prefilled pen. Prefilled Pen and Vial: Each mL contains 100 units of insulin glargine-yfgn and the inactive ingredients: glycerol (20 mg), metacresol (2.7 mg), zinc chloride (content adjusted to provide 30 mcg zinc ion), and Water for Injection, USP. The vial also contains polysorbate 20 (20 mcg). The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. Insulin Glargine - yfgn has a pH of approximately 4."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine products, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to > 24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for insulin glargine. Figure 1: Glucose-Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including insulin glargine products, may vary between patients and within the same patient. Glucose-Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Elimination Metabolism A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des- 30 B -Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation. Specific Populations Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n = 3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n = 349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between insulin glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with insulin glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Study A, n = 585, Study B n = 534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. In Study A, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (99%) and 56% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 24.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. In Study B, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (95%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 19 years. In these 3 adult studies, insulin glargine and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in adult patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications (n = 518), a basal-bolus regimen of insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59 years. The majority of patients were White (81%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. Insulin glargine had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily insulin glargine or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of insulin glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started insulin glargine at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the insulin glargine and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose \u2264 100 mg/dL. After the insulin glargine or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted, other anti-diabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55 years. The majority of patients were White (85%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The insulin glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the insulin glargine group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 41 years. All patients were White (100%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. Insulin glargine administered at pre-breakfast or at pre-dinner (both once daily) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to insulin glargine injection regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the insulin glargine-breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two groups (pre-dinner, bedtime) discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of once daily insulin glargine administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 61 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as insulin glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12).

Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 years) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations, and indicate similarity of insulin glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. In this study, the numbers of retinal adverse events reported for insulin glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of insulin glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults \u2265 50 years of age with: \u2022 Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and \u2022 Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that insulin glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints: \u2022 The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. \u2022 The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients were randomized to either insulin glargine (N = 6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of \u2264 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N = 6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m 2 . Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors. Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of patients randomized to insulin glargine and standard care respectively at end of study. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the study was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the insulin glargine and standard care group respectively. The median dose of insulin glargine at end of study was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to insulin glargine were using insulin glargine at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the insulin glargine group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. \u2022 Check the Insulin Glargine-yfgn in the vial to make sure it is clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Glargine-yfgn if it is colored or cloudy, or if you see particles in the solution. \u2022 Do not use Insulin Glargine-yfgn after the expiration date stamped on the label or 28 days after you first use it. \u2022 Always use a syringe that is marked for U-100 insulin. If you use a syringe other than a U-100 insulin syringe, you may get the wrong dose of Insulin Glargine-yfgn. \u2022 Always use a new syringe and a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and prevent blocked needles. Step 1: If you are using a new Insulin Glargine-yfgn vial, remove the protective cap. Do not remove the rubber stopper. Step 2: Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. You do not have to shake the vial of Insulin Glargine-yfgn before use. Step 3: Draw air into the syringe equal to your Insulin Glargine-yfgn dose. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject the air into the vial. Step 4: Leave the syringe in the vial and turn both upside down. Hold the syringe and vial firmly in one hand. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the Insulin Glargine-yfgn solution. With your free hand, pull the plunger to withdraw the correct dose into the syringe. Step 5: Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are in the syringe, hold the syringe straight up and tap the side of the syringe until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and draw insulin back in until you have the correct dose. Step 6: Remove the needle from the vial. Do not let the needle touch anything. You are now ready to inject. Injecting Insulin Glargine-yfgn: \u2022 Inject your Insulin Glargine-yfgn (with a syringe) exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. \u2022 Inject Insulin Glargine-yfgn 1 time per day. Inject at any time of the day but at the same time every day. Step 7: Choose your injection site: \u2022 Insulin Glargine-yfgn is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper arms, thighs, or stomach area (abdomen). \u2022 Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in the skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. \u2022 Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. \u2022 Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. \u2022 Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab to clean the injection site. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Step 8: \u2022 Pinch the skin. \u2022 Insert the needle under the skin in the way your healthcare provider showed you. \u2022 Release the skin. \u2022 Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the Insulin Glargine-yfgn. \u2022 Leave the needle in the skin for about 10 seconds. Step 9: \u2022 Pull the needle straight out of your skin. \u2022 Gently press the injection site for several seconds. Do not rub the area. \u2022 Do not recap the used needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle-stick injury. Disposing of Used Needles and Syringes \u2022 Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Storing and Disposing Insulin Glargine-yfgn? Unopened (not in-use) Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials \u2022 Store unused Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials in the refrigerator from 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Glargine-yfgn. \u2022 Keep Insulin Glargine-yfgn away from direct heat and light. \u2022 If a vial has been frozen or overheated, throw it away. \u2022 Unopened vials can be used until the expiration date on the carton and vial label if they have been stored in the refrigerator (they can be stored past 28 days in the refrigerator). \u2022 Unopened vials should be thrown away after 28 days if they are stored at room temperature. After Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials have been opened (in-use) \u2022 Store in-use (opened) Insulin Glargine-yfgn injection vials in a refrigerator from 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) or at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) for up to 28 days . \u2022 Do not freeze Insulin Glargine-yfgn. If a vial has to be frozen, throw it away. \u2022 Keep Insulin Glargine-yfgn injection out of direct heat and light. \u2022 The Insulin Glargine-yfgn vial you are using should be thrown away after 28 days or if the expiration date has passed, even if it still has insulin left in it.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Glargine-yfgn (in' su lin glar' jeen) injection, for subcutaneous use 3 mL Single-Patient-Use PREFILLED PEN: 100 units/mL (U-100) This product is SEMGLEE (insulin glargine-yfgn). Read these Instructions for Use before you start using the Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen and each time you get a new Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen without help from a person trained to use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen. Insulin Glargine-yfgn is a disposable prefilled pen used to inject Insulin Glargine-yfgn. Each Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen has 300 units of insulin which can be used for multiple injections. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will only move to the end of the cartridge when 300 units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn have been given. Important Information You Need to Know Before Injecting Insulin Glargine-yfgn: Do not use your pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Do not use a syringe to remove Insulin Glargine-yfgn from your pen. Do not reuse needles. If you do, you might get the wrong dose of Insulin Glargine-yfgn or you may increase the chances of getting an infection. Always perform a safety test (see Step 3 ). Always carry a spare pen and spare needles in case they get lost or stop working. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose (see Places to Inject ) Learn to Inject \u2022 Talk with your healthcare provider about how to inject before using your pen. \u2022 Ask for help if you have problems handling the pen, for example if you have problems with your sight. \u2022 Read all these instructions before using your pen. If you do not follow all these instructions, you may get too much or too little insulin. Need Help? If you have any questions about your pen or about diabetes, ask your healthcare provider, or call Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468. Extra Items You Will Need \u2022 A new sterile needle (see Step 2 ). \u2022 An alcohol swab. \u2022 A puncture-resistant container for used needles and pens. (See Throwing your pen away ) Places to inject Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Get to know your pen Step 1: Check your pen Take a new pen out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before you inject. Cold Insulin is more painful to inject. 1A Check the name and expiration date on the label of your pen. \u2022 Make sure you have the correct insulin (See Figure a). \u2022 Do not use your pen after the expiration date (See Figure b). 1B Pull off the pen cap (See Figure c). 1C Check that the insulin is clear (See Figure d). \u2022 Do not use the pen if the insulin looks cloudy, colored or contains particles. 1D Wipe the rubber seal with an alcohol swab (See Figure e). If you have other injector pens: \u2022 Making sure you have the correct medicine is especially important if you have other injector pens. Step 2: Attach a new needle \u2022 Do not reuse needles. Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, contamination, and infection. Only use needles that are compatible for use with Insulin Glargine-yfgn, such as Embecta Ultra Fine. 2A Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal (See Figure f). 2B Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not over-tighten (See Figure g). 2C Pull off the outer needle cap (See Figure h). Keep this for later. 2D Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away (See Figure i). Handling needles \u2022 Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Step 3: Do a safety test Always do a safety test before each injection to: \u2022 Check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly. \u2022 Make sure that you get the correct Insulin Glargine-yfgn dose. 3A Select 2 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark (See Figure j). 3B Press the injection button all the way in (See Figure k). When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly. If no insulin appears: \u2022 You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin. \u2022 If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: - change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ), - then repeat the safety test ( Step 3 ). \u2022 Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. \u2022 Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. If you see air bubbles: \u2022 You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. Step 4: Select the dose Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen. 4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to \u201c0\u201d (See Figure l). 4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose (See Figure m). \u2022 If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. \u2022 If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left. \u2022 If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and use a new pen to complete your dose. How to read the dose window Even numbers are shown in line with dose pointer (See Figure n). Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers (See Figure o). Units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in your pen: \u2022 Your pen contains a total of 300 units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than 1 dose. \u2022 You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale. Step 5: Injecting Your Insulin Glargine-yfgn Dose If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. See the section below for help. 5A Choose a place to inject as shown in the section \u201cPlaces to Inject\u201d 5B Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider (See Figure p). Do not touch the injection button yet. 5C Place your thumb on the injection button. Slowly press all the way in and hold (see Figure q). Do not press hard. \u2022 Do not press at an angle. Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 5D Keep the injection button held in and when you see \u201c0\u201d in the dose window, slowly count to 10 (See Figure r). \u2022 This will make sure you get your full dose. 5E After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin. If you find it hard to press the button in: \u2022 Change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ) then do a safety test (see Step 3 ). \u2022 If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. \u2022 Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. Step 6: Remove the needle \u2022 Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. \u2022 Do not put the inner needle cap back on. 6A Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap. Then push firmly on (See Figure s). \u2022 The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. 6B Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle (See Figure t). \u2022 Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. 6C Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see Throwing your pen away at the end of this Instructions for Use). (See Figure u). 6D Put your pen cap back on (See Figure v). \u2022 Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. Storing the Insulin Glargine-yfgn Pen Before first use: \u2022 Keep new pens in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Do not freeze. Do not use Insulin Glargine-yfgn if it has been frozen. After first use: \u2022 Keep your pen at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) . \u2022 Keep your pen away from heat or light. \u2022 Store your pen with the pen cap on. \u2022 Do not put your pen back in the refrigerator. \u2022 Do not store your pen with the needle attached. \u2022 Keep out of the reach of children. \u2022 Only use your pen for up to 28 days after its first use. Throw away the Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen you are using after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. Caring for Your Insulin Glargine-yfgn Pen Handle your pen with care \u2022 Do no t drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. \u2022 If you think that your pen may be damaged, do not try to fix it. Use a new one. Protect your pen from dust and dirt You can clean the outside of your pen by wiping it with a damp cloth (water only). Do not soak, wash or lubricate your pen. This may damage it. Throwing your Pen away \u2022 The used Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. \u2022 Put the used needle in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the used needles in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: - made of a heavy-duty plastic, - can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, - upright and stable during use, - leak-resistant, and - properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, glycemic control, type of diabetes, and prior insulin use. ( 2.2 ) Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 2.3 ) and how to change to Insulin Glargine from other insulins ( 2.4 ) Closely monitor glucose when switching to Insulin Glargine and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is LANTUS (insulin glargine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Visually inspect Insulin Glargine vials and SoloStar prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Administer Insulin Glargine subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix Insulin Glargine with any other insulin or solution. The Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. Use Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Administer Insulin Glargine subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Glargine based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. 2.3 Initiation of Insulin Glargine Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Switching to Insulin Glargine from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. When switching from: Once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) to once-daily Insulin Glargine (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is 80% of the TOUJEO dosage that is being discontinued. Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued. Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen, insulin syringe, or needle between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen : Make changes to a patient's insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia : May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitant drugs, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia due to medication errors : Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin Glargine. Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 ) Hypokalemia : May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar Prefilled Pen, Insulin Syringe, or Needle Between Patients Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Glargine vials must never re-use or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including Insulin Glargine. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. The long-acting effect of Insulin Glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Glargine may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Glargine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Glargine; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Insulin Glargine is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Glargine, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Insulin Glargine include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2,327 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Glargine or NPH in Studies A, B, C, and D [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 39 years, 54% were male, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 kg/m 2 . Ninety-seven percent were White, 2% were Black or African American and less than 1% were Asian. Approximately 3% of the patients in studies B and C were Hispanic. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1,563 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Glargine or NPH in Studies E, F, and G [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 59 years, 58% were male, and mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2 . Eighty-seven percent were White, 8% were Black or African American and 3% were Asian. Approximately 9 % of patients in Study F were Hispanic. The frequencies of adverse reactions during Insulin Glargine clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=1,257) NPH, % (n=1,070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body system not specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body system not specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u226510% in a 5-Year Study of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in a 28-Week Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection Body system not specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with Insulin Glargine. Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the Insulin Glargine clinical studies. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (\u226456 mg/dL in the 5-year study and \u226436 mg/dL in the ORIGIN study) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Percentages of Insulin Glargine\u2013treated adult patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Insulin Glargine clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6 ). In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult studies with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine N=292 NPH N=293 Insulin Glargine N=264 NPH N=270 Insulin Glargine N=310 NPH N=309 Insulin Glargine N=174 NPH N=175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine N=289 NPH N=281 Insulin Glargine N=259 NPH N=259 Insulin Glargine N=513 NPH N=504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Insulin Glargine and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Study ORIGIN Study Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years Insulin Glargine N=6231 Standard Care N=6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking Insulin Glargine have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including Insulin Glargine, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulin including Insulin Glargine and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Hypersensitivity Reactions Local Reactions Patients taking Insulin Glargine experienced injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of injection site pain in Insulin Glargine\u2013treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock have occurred with insulin, including Insulin Glargine and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In clinical studies of Insulin Glargine, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and Insulin Glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Insulin Glargine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which rapid-acting insulins and other insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of Insulin Glargine. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), on a mg/kg basis. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day on a mg/kg basis, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Insulin Glargine, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Glargine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus have been established. Use of Insulin Glargine for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study D) in 174 Insulin Glargine-treated pediatric patients aged 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and from adequate and well-controlled studies of Insulin Glargine in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in studies with type 1 diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with Insulin Glargine, 15% (n=316) were \u226565 years of age and 2% (n=42) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Insulin Glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dosage increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Glargine has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Glargine has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine is a long-acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12). Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C-terminus of the B-chain. Insulin glargine has a molecular weight of 6063 Da. Insulin Glargine injection is a sterile, clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous use in a 10 mL multiple-dose vial or a 3 mL single-patient use prefilled pen (Insulin Glargine Solostar). Prefilled Pen (Insulin Glargine Solostar) and Vial: Each mL contains 100 units of insulin glargine and the inactive ingredients: glycerol 85% (20 mg), m-cresol (2.7 mg), zinc (30 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. The vial also contains polysorbate 20 (20 mcg). The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Insulin Glargine has a pH of approximately 4."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous Insulin Glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to >24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for Insulin Glargine. Figure 1: Glucose-Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of Insulin Glargine was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including Insulin Glargine, may vary between patients and within the same patient. Figure 1 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection of Insulin Glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Elimination Metabolism A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des-30 B -Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation. Specific Populations Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n=3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n=349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Tables 9\u201311). In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with Insulin Glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Study A, n=585, Study B n=534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. Insulin Glargine was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. In Study A, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (99%) and 56% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 24.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. In Study B, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (95%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 diabetes (n=619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. Insulin Glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 19 years. In these 3 adult studies, Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Insulin Glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 11.7 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 52% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 18.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 5 years.

The average age was 60 years old. The majority of patients were White (93%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 29.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin Glargine administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11). The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in adult patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications (n=518), a basal-bolus regimen of Insulin Glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59 years. The majority of patients were White (81%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. Insulin Glargine had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily Insulin Glargine or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started Insulin Glargine at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose \u2264100 mg/dL. After the Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted, other antidiabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55 years. The majority of patients were White (85%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The Insulin Glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the Insulin Glargine group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 41 years. All patients were White (100%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. Insulin Glargine administered at pre-breakfast or at pre-dinner (both once daily) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12 ). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to Insulin Glargine injection regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the Insulin Glargine-breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two groups (pre-dinner, bedtime) discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of once daily Insulin Glargine administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n=697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 61 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin Glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as Insulin Glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12 ).

Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 years) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations, and indicate similarity of Insulin Glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. In this study, the numbers of retinal adverse events reported for Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of Insulin Glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults \u226550 years of age with: Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that Insulin Glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints: The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients were randomized to either Insulin Glargine (N=6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of \u226495 mg/dL or to standard care (N=6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m 2 . Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors. Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of patients randomized to Insulin Glargine and standard care respectively at end of study. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the study was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the Insulin Glargine and standard care group respectively. The median dose of Insulin Glargine at end of study was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to Insulin Glargine were using Insulin Glargine at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the Insulin Glargine group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14 ). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

Do not use Insulin Glargine after the expiration date stamped on the label or 28 days after you first use it. Always use a syringe that is marked for U-100 insulin . If you use a syringe other than a U-100 insulin syringe, you may get the wrong dose of Insulin Glargine. Always use a new syringe and a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and prevent blocked needles. Step 1: If you are using a new Insulin Glargine vial, remove the protective cap. Do not remove the stopper. Step 2: Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. You do not have to shake the vial of Insulin Glargine before use. Step 3: Draw air into the syringe equal to your Insulin Glargine dose. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject the air into the vial. Step 4: Leave the syringe in the vial and turn both upside down. Hold the syringe and vial firmly in one hand. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the Insulin Glargine solution. With your free hand, pull the plunger to withdraw the correct dose into the syringe. Step 5: Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are in the syringe, hold the syringe straight up and tap the side of the syringe until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and draw insulin back in until you have the correct dose. Step 6: Remove the needle from the vial. Do not let the needle touch anything. You are now ready to inject. Injecting Insulin Glargine: Inject your Insulin Glargine (with a syringe) exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Insulin Glargine is injected once daily at any time of the day but at the same time every day. Step 7: Choose your injection site: Insulin Glargine is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper arms, thighs, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in the skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab to clean the injection site. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Step 8: Pinch the skin. Insert the needle under the skin in the way your healthcare provider showed you. Release the skin. Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the Insulin Glargine. Leave the needle in the skin for about 10 seconds. Step 9: Pull the needle straight out of your skin. Gently press the injection site for several seconds. Do not rub the area. Do not recap the used needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle-stick injury. Disposing of Used Needles and Syringes Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Storing and Disposing Insulin Glargine? Unopened (not in-use) Insulin Glargine vials Store unused Insulin Glargine vials in the refrigerator from 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C).

      "INTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Glargine SOLOSTAR \u00ae (IN-su-lin-GLAR-gine) injection, for subcutaneous use 3 mL Single-Patient-Use PREFILLED PEN: 100 units/mL (U-100) This product is LANTUS \u00ae (insulin glargine). Read these Instructions for Use before you start taking the Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen and each time you get a new Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen without help from a person trained to use the Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen. Insulin Glargine SoloStar is a disposable prefilled pen used to inject Insulin Glargine. Each Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen has 300 units of insulin which can be used for multiple injections. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will only move to the end of the cartridge when 300 units of Insulin Glargine have been given. Important Information You Need to Know Before Injecting Insulin Glargine Do not use your pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Do not use a syringe to remove Insulin Glargine from your pen. Do not reuse needles. If you do, you might get the wrong dose of Insulin Glargine and/or increase the chance of getting an infection. Always perform a safety test (see Step 3 ). Always carry a spare pen and spare needles in case they got lost or stop working. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose (see \" Places to inject \" ). Learn to Inject Talk with your healthcare provider about how to inject before using your pen. Ask for help if you have problems handling the pen, for example if you have problems with your sight. Read all these instructions before using your pen. If you do not follow all these instructions, you may get too much or too little insulin. Need Help? If you have any questions about your pen or about diabetes, ask your healthcare provider, or go to www.winthropus.com or call sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610. Extra Items You Will Need a new sterile needle (see Step 2 ). an alcohol swab. a puncture-resistant container for used needles and pens. (See \" Throwing your pen away \" ) Places to Inject Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Get to know your pen Step 1: Check your pen Take a new pen out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before you inject. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 1A Check the name and expiration date on the label of your pen. Make sure you have the correct insulin. Do not use your pen after the expiration date. 1B Pull off the pen cap. 1C Check that the insulin is clear. Do not use the pen if the insulin looks cloudy, colored or contains particles. 1D Wipe the rubber seal with an alcohol swab. If you have other injector pens: Making sure you have the correct medicine is especially important if you have other injector pens. Step 2: Attach a new needle Do not reuse needles. Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, contamination, and infection. Only use needles Other brands listed are the registered trademarks of their respective owners and are not trademarks of sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC. that are compatible for use with Insulin Glargine SoloStar, such as BD Ultra-Fine \u00ae . 2A Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal. 2B Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not over-tighten. 2C Pull off the outer needle cap. Keep this for later. 2D Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away. Handling needles Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Step 3: Do a safety test Always do a safety test before each injection to: Check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly. Make sure that you get the correct Insulin Glargine dose. 3A Select 2 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark. 3B Press the injection button all the way in. When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly: If no insulin appears: You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin. If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: \u2013 change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ), \u2013 then repeat the safety test ( Step 3 ). Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. If you see air bubbles: You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. Step 4: Select the dose Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen. 4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to \"0.\" 4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose. If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left. If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and use a new pen to complete your dose. How to read the dose window Even numbers are shown in line with dose pointer. Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers. Units of Insulin Glargine in your pen: Your pen contains a total of 300 units of Insulin Glargine. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than 1 dose. You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale. Step 5: Injecting Your Insulin Glargine Dose If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. See the section below for help. 5A Choose a place to inject as shown in the picture above. 5B Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider. Do not touch the injection button yet. 5C Place your thumb on the injection button. Then press all the way in and hold. Do not press at an angle. Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 5D Keep the injection button held in and when you see \"0\" in the dose window, slowly count to 10. This will make sure you get your full dose. 5E After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin. If you find it hard to press the button in: Change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ) then do a safety test (see Step 3 ). If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. Step 6: Remove the needle Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Do not put the inner needle cap back on. 6A Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap. Then push firmly on. The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. 6B Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle. Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. 6C Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see \" Throwing your pen away \" at the end of this Instructions for Use). 6D Put your pen cap back on. Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. Storing the Insulin Glargine Solostar Pen Before first use Keep new pens in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) . Do not freeze. Do not use Insulin Glargine if it has been frozen. After first use Keep your pen at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) . Keep your pen away from heat or light. Store your pen with the pen cap on. Do not put your pen back in the refrigerator. Do not store your pen with the needle attached. Keep out of the reach of children. Only use your pen for up to 28 days after its first use. Throw away the Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen you are using after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. Caring for Your Insulin Glargine SoloStar Pen Handle your pen with care Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. If you think that your pen may be damaged, do not try to fix it. Use a new one. Protect your pen from dust and dirt You can clean the outside of your pen by wiping it with a damp cloth (water only). Do not soak, wash or lubricate your pen. This may damage it. Throwing your pen away The used Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. Put the used needle in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the used needles in your household trash.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, glycemic control, type of diabetes, and prior insulin use. ( 2.2 ) Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 2.3 ) and how to change to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulins. ( 2.4 ) Closely monitor glucose when switching to Insulin Glargine-yfgn and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is Insulin Glargine-yfgn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Visually inspect Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials and prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Administer Insulin Glargine-yfgn subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. During changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 ) ]. Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix Insulin Glargine-yfgn with any other insulin or solution. The Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. Use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Administer Insulin Glargine-yfgn subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn based on the patient\u2019s metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine-yfgn must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. 2.3 Initiation of Insulin Glargine-yfgn Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Switching to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulin therapies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 ) ]. When switching from: Once-daily insulin glargine 300 units/mL to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine, 300 units/mL dosage that is being discontinued. Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued. Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen, insulin syringe, or needle between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitant drugs, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia due to medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin Glargine-yfgn. Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 ) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine-yfgn Prefilled Pen, Insulin Syringe, or Needle Between Patients Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Glargine-yfgn vials must never re-use or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including insulin glargine products. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. The long-acting effect of insulin glargine products may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of insulin glargine products may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )]. Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7) ]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine-yfgn and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including insulin glargine products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Glargine-yfgn; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Insulin Glargine-yfgn is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine products or one of the excipients. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including insulin glargine products, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine-yfgn, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with insulin glargine products include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2,327 patients with type 1 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies A, B, C, and D [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 39 years, 54% were male and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 kg/m 2 . Ninety-seven percent were White, 2% were Black or African American and less than 1% were Asian. Approximately 3% of the patients in studies B and C were Hispanic. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1,563 patients with type 2 diabetes to insulin glargine or NPH in Studies E, F, and G [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 59 years, 58% were male, and the mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2 . Eighty-seven percent were White, 8% were Black or African American, and 3% were Asian. Approximately 9% of patients in Study F were Hispanic. The frequencies of adverse reactions during insulin glargine clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 1,257) NPH,% (n = 1,070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body system not specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 849) NPH,% (n = 714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body system not specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 10% in a 5-Year Study of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 514) NPH,% (n = 503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u2265 5% in a 28-Week Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n = 174) NPH,% (n = 175) Infection Body system not specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with insulin glargine. Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (\u2264 56 mg/dL in the 5-year study and \u2264 36 mg/dL in the ORIGIN study) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Percentages of insulin glargine-treated adult patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6). In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult studies with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine n = 292 NPH n = 293 Insulin Glargine n = 264 NPH n = 270 Insulin Glargine n = 310 NPH n = 309 Insulin Glargine n = 174 NPH n = 175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine n = 289 NPH n = 281 Insulin Glargine n = 259 NPH n = 259 Insulin Glargine n = 513 NPH n = 504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the insulin glargine and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Study ORIGIN Study Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years Insulin Glargine n = 6231 Standard Care n = 6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking insulin glargine products have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including insulin glargine products, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulin including insulin glargine products and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Hypersensitivity Reactions Local Reactions Patients taking insulin glargine experienced injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of injection site pain in insulin glargine-treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock have occurred with insulin, including insulin glargine products and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other insulin glargine products may be misleading. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In clinical studies of insulin glargine, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of insulin glargine products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which rapid-acting insulins and other insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine products. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine products during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine products and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data ). In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine products and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), on a mg/kg basis. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day on a mg/kg basis, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine products in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Insulin Glargine-yfgn, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Glargine-yfgn or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine-yfgn to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus have been established. Use of Insulin Glargine-yfgn for this indication is supported by Insulin Glargine-yfgn's approval as a biosimilar to insulin glargine and evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study D) in 174 insulin glargine-treated pediatric patients aged 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus and from adequate and well-controlled studies of insulin glargine in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2)] . In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in studies with type 1 diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with insulin glargine, 15% (n=316) were \u2265 65 years of age and 2% (n=42) were \u2265 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of insulin glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine-yfgn is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dosage increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine products, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to > 24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for insulin glargine. Figure 1: Glucose-Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including insulin glargine products, may vary between patients and within the same patient. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Elimination Metabolism A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des- 30 B -Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation. Specific Populations Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine products has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n = 3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n = 349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between insulin glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In mice and rats, standard two-year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0.455 mg/kg, which was for the rat approximately 65 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day) on a mg/kg basis. Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats and mice in acid vehicle containing groups and are considered a response to chronic tissue irritation and inflammation in rodents. These tumors were not found in female animals, in saline control, or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle. Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells (Ames and HGPRT-test) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations (cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters). In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which was approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day) maternal toxicity due to dose-dependent hypoglycemia, including some deaths, was observed. Consequently, a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high-dose group only. Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of insulin glargine given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Tables 9-11). In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with insulin glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Study A, n = 585, Study B n = 534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. In Study A, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (99%) and 56% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 24.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. In Study B, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (95%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 19 years. In these 3 adult studies, insulin glargine and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 11.7 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 52% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 18.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Similar effects on HbA1c (Table 10) were observed in both treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

The average age was 60 years old. The majority of patients were White (93%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 29.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin glargine administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11). The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in insulin glargine and NPH insulin treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in adult patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications (n = 518), a basal-bolus regimen of insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59 years. The majority of patients were White (81%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. Insulin glargine had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily insulin glargine or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of insulin glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started insulin glargine at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the insulin glargine and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose \u2264 100 mg/dL. After the insulin glargine or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted, other anti-diabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55 years. The majority of patients were White (85%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The insulin glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the insulin glargine group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 41 years. All patients were White (100%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. Insulin glargine administered at pre-breakfast or at pre-dinner (both once daily) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to insulin glargine injection regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the insulin glargine-breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two groups (pre-dinner, bedtime) discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of once daily insulin glargine administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n = 697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 61 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as insulin glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12).

Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 years) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations and indicate similarity of insulin glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. In this study, the numbers of retinal adverse events reported for insulin glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of insulin glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults \u2265 50 years of age with: Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that insulin glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints: The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients were randomized to either insulin glargine (N = 6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of \u2264 95 mg/dL or to standard care (N = 6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m 2 . Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors. Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of patients randomized to insulin glargine and standard care respectively at end of study. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the study was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the insulin glargine and standard care group respectively. The median dose of insulin glargine at end of study was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to insulin glargine were using insulin glargine at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the insulin glargine group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

Read these Instructions for Use before you start using the Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen and each time you get a new Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen without help from a person trained to use the Insulin Glargine-yfgn prefilled pen . Insulin Glargine-yfgn is a disposable prefilled pen used to inject Insulin Glargine-yfgn. Each Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen has 300 units of insulin which can be used for multiple injections. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will only move to the end of the cartridge when 300 units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn have been given. Important Information You Need to Know Before Injecting Insulin Glargine-yfgn: Do not use your pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Do not use a syringe to remove Insulin Glargine-yfgn from your pen. Do not reuse needles. If you do, you might get the wrong dose of Insulin Glargine-yfgn or you may increase the chances of getting an infection. Always perform a safety test (see Step 3 ). Always carry a spare pen and spare needles in case they get lost or stop working. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose (see \" Places to Inject\" ). Learn to Inject Talk with your healthcare provider about how to inject before using your pen. Ask for help if you have problems handling the pen, for example if you have problems with your sight. Read all these instructions before using your pen. If you do not follow all these instructions, you may get too much or too little insulin. Need Help? If you have any questions about your pen or about diabetes, ask your healthcare provider, or call Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 Extra Items You Will Need A new sterile needle (see Step 2 ). An alcohol swab. A puncture-resistant container for used needles and pens. (See \" Throwing your pen away\" ) Places to inject Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Get to know your pen Step 1: Check your pen Take a new pen out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before you inject. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 1A Check the name and expiration date on the label of your pen. Make sure you have the correct insulin (See Figure a). Do not use your pen after the expiration date (See Figure b). 1B Pull off the pen cap (See Figure c) . 1C Check that the insulin is clear (See Figure d). Do not use the pen if the insulin looks cloudy, colored or contains particles. 1D Wipe the rubber seal with an alcohol swab (See Figure e). If you have other injector pens: Making sure you have the correct medicine is especially important if you have other injector pens. Step 2: Attach a new needle Do not reuse needles. Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, contamination, and infection. Only use needles that are compatible for use with Insulin Glargine-yfgn, such as Embecta Ultra fine 2A Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal (See Figure f) . 2B Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not over-tighten (See Figure g). 2C Pull off the outer needle cap (See Figure h) . Keep this for later. 2D Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away (See Figure i). Handling needles Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Step 3: Do a safety test Always do a safety test before each injection to: Check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly . Make sure that you get the correct Insulin Glargine-yfgn dose. 3A Select 2 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark (See Figure j). 3B Press the injection button all the way in (See Figure k). When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly. If no insulin appears: You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin. If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ), then repeat the safety test ( Step 3 ). Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. If you see air bubbles: You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. Step 4: Select the dose Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen. 4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to \u201c0\u201d (See Figure l) . 4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose (See Figure m). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left. If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and use a new pen to complete your dose. How to read the dose window Even numbers are shown in line with dose pointer (See Figure n). Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers (See Figure o). Units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in your pen: Your pen contains a total of 300 units of Insulin Glargine-yfgn. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than 1 dose. You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale. Step 5: Injecting Your Insulin Glargine-yfgn Dose If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. See the section below for help. Choose a place to inject as shown in the section \"Places to Inject\" Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider (See Figure p) . Do not touch the injection button yet. 5C Place your thumb on the injection button. Slowly press all the way in and hold (see Figure q). Do not press hard . Do not press at an angle. Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 5D Keep the injection button held in and when you see \"0\" in the dose window, slowly count to 10 (See Figure r) . This will make sure you get your full dose. 5E After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin. If you find it hard to press the button in: Change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ) then do a safety test (see Step 3 ). If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. Step 6: Remove the needle Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Do not put the inner needle cap back on. 6A Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap. Then push firmly on (See Figure s) . \u2022 The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. 6B Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle (See Figure t) . Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. 6C Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see \u201cThrowing your pen away\u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use). (See Figure u) . 6D Put your pen cap back on (See Figure v). Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. Storing the Insulin Glargine-yfgn Pen Before first use: \u2022 Keep new pens in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) . \u2022 Do not freeze. Do not use Insulin Glargine-yfgn if it has been frozen. After first use: \u2022 Keep your pen at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C). \u2022 Keep your pen away from heat or light. \u2022 Store your pen with the pen cap on. \u2022 Do not put your pen back in the refrigerator. \u2022 Do not store your pen with the needle attached \u2022 Keep out of the reach of children. \u2022 Only use your pen for up to 28 days after its first use. Throw away the Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen you are using after 28 days, even if it still has insulin left in it. Caring for Your Insulin Glargine-yfgn Pen Handle your pen with care \u2022 Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. \u2022 If you think that your pen may be damaged, do not try to fix it. Use a new one. Protect your pen from dust and dirt You can clean the outside of your pen by wiping it with a damp cloth (water only). Do not soak, wash or lubricate your pen. This may damage it. Throwing your Pen away The used Insulin Glargine-yfgn pen may be thrown away in your household trash after you have removed the needle. Put the used needle in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the used needles in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2014 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2014 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2014 upright and stable during use, \u2014 leak-resistant, and \u2014 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, glycemic control, type of diabetes, and prior insulin use. ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.2 ) Closely monitor glucose when changing to Insulin glargine and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Administer Insulin glargine subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Prior to initiation of Insulin glargine, train patients on proper use and injection technique. Patient should follow the Instructions for Use to correctly administer Insulin glargine. Administer Insulin glargine subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Visually inspect Insulin glargine vials and SoloStar prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. The Insulin glargine SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. Use Insulin glargine SoloStar prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. Refrigerate unused (unopened) Insulin glargine vials and SoloStar \u00ae prefilled pens. Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix Insulin glargine with any other insulin or solution. The SoloStar prefilled pen is for single patient use only [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin glargine based on the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.3 Initiation of Insulin Glargine Therapy Type 1 Diabetes In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin glargine must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. The recommended starting dose of Insulin glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short-acting, premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dose of Insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. One may need to adjust the amount and timing of short- or rapid-acting insulins and dosages of any oral antidiabetic drugs. 2.4 Changing to Insulin Glargine from Other Insulin Therapies If changing patients from once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine) 300 units/mL to once-daily Insulin glargine, the recommended initial Insulin glargine dose is 80% of the TOUJEO dose that is being discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Insulin glargine, a change in the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the amount and timing of the shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral antidiabetic drugs may need to be adjusted. If changing patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin glargine, the recommended initial Insulin glargine dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued. If changing patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin glargine, the recommended initial Insulin glargine dosage is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued. This dosage reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an Insulin glargine SoloStar prefilled pen between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen : Make changes to a patient's insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia : May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, coadministered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 , 6.1 ) Medication Errors : Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 , 6.3 ) Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin glargine. Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Hypokalemia : May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar Prefilled Pen, Syringe, or Needle Between Patients Insulin glargine SoloStar prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin glargine vials must never re-use or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including Insulin glargine. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin glargine may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to coadministered medication [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. The long-acting effect of Insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. 5.4 Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products, particularly between long-acting insulins and rapid-acting insulins, have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin glargine and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulin products, including Insulin glargine. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin glargine; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Insulin glargine is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulin products, including Insulin glargine, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin glargine, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Insulin glargine include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2327 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin glargine or NPH. The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 38.5 years. Fifty-four percent were male, 96.9% were Caucasian, 1.8% were Black or African American and 2.7% were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 25.1 kg/m 2 . The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1563 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin glargine or NPH. The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59.3 years. Fifty-eight percent were male, 86.7% were Caucasian, 7.8% were Black or African American and 9% were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2 . The frequencies of adverse events during Insulin glargine clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below. Table 1: Adverse Events in Pooled Clinical Trials up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes (adverse events with frequency \u22655%) Insulin glargine, % (n=1257) NPH, % (n=1070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body system not specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse Events in Pooled Clinical Trials up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (adverse events with frequency \u22655%) Insulin glargine, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body system not specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse Events in a 5-Year Trial of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (adverse events with frequency \u226510%) Insulin glargine, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse Events in a 28-Week Clinical Trial of Children and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes (adverse events with frequency \u22655%) Insulin glargine, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection Body system not specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin glargine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the Insulin glargine individual clinical trials. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (\u226456 mg/dL in the 5-year trial and \u226436 mg/dL in the ORIGIN trial) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Percentages of Insulin glargine\u2013treated adult patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Insulin glargine clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6 ). In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin Insulin glargine N=292 NPH N=293 Insulin glargine N=264 NPH N=270 Insulin glargine N=310 NPH N=309 Insulin glargine N=174 NPH N=175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin Insulin glargine N=289 NPH N=281 Insulin glargine N=259 NPH N=259 Insulin glargine N=513 NPH N=504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Insulin glargine and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Trial ORIGIN Trial Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years Insulin glargine N=6231 Standard Care N=6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking Insulin glargine have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including Insulin glargine, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including Insulin glargine and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Allergic Reactions Local allergy As with any insulin therapy, patients taking Insulin glargine may experience injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of treatment-emergent injection site pain in Insulin glargine\u2013treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic allergy Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock may occur with any insulin, including Insulin glargine and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In phase 3 clinical trials of Insulin glargine, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and Insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Insulin glargine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly rapid-acting insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of Insulin glargine [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . To avoid medication errors between Insulin glargine and other insulins, patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes [see Data ] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dose of 0.2 units/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with an HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), on a mg/kg basis. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0.2 units/kg/day on a mg/kg basis, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for insulin glargine, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from insulin glargine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin glargine have been established in pediatric patients (age 6 to 15 years) with type 1 diabetes [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Insulin glargine in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age with type 1 diabetes and pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes have not been established. The dosage recommendation when changing to Insulin glargine in pediatric patients (age 6 to 15 years) with type 1 diabetes is the same as that described for adults [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4) , Clinical Studies (14) ] . As in adults, the dosage of Insulin glargine must be individualized in pediatric patients (age 6 to 15 years) with type 1 diabetes based on metabolic needs and frequent monitoring of blood glucose. In the pediatric clinical trial, pediatric patients (age 6 to 15 years) with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in trials with type 1 diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with Insulin glargine, 15% were \u226565 years of age and 2% were \u226575 years of age. The only difference in safety or effectiveness in the subpopulation of patients \u226565 years of age compared to the entire study population was a higher incidence of cardiovascular events typically seen in an older population in the Insulin glargine and NPH treatment groups. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin glargine is administered to geriatric patients. In elderly patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin glargine has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for Insulin glargine in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin glargine has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for Insulin glargine in patients with renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.8 Obesity In controlled clinical trials, subgroup analyses based on BMI did not show differences in safety and efficacy between Insulin glargine and NPH."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in drug dosage, meal patterns, or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine (insulin glargine injection) is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for subcutaneous use. Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog that is a long-acting, parenteral blood-glucose-lowering agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) ] . Insulin glargine has low aqueous solubility at neutral pH. At pH 4 insulin glargine is completely soluble. After injection into the subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralized, leading to formation of microprecipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are slowly released, resulting in a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This profile allows once-daily dosing as a basal insulin. Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C-terminus of the B-chain. Chemically, insulin glargine is 21 A -Gly-30 B a-L-Arg-30 B b-L-Arg-human insulin and has the empirical formula C 267 H 404 N 72 O 78 S 6 and a molecular weight of 6063. Insulin glargine has the following structural formula: Insulin glargine consists of insulin glargine dissolved in a clear aqueous fluid. Each milliliter of insulin glargine injection contains 100 units (3.6378 mg) insulin glargine. The 10 mL vial presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL: 30 mcg zinc, 2.7 mg m-cresol, 20 mg glycerol 85%, 20 mcg polysorbate 20, and water for injection. The 3 mL prefilled pen presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL: 30 mcg zinc, 2.7 mg m-cresol, 20 mg glycerol 85%, and water for injection. The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Insulin glargine has a pH of approximately 4. Chemical Structure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after the injection. The median time between injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to >24.0 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for insulin glargine. Figure 1: Activity Profile in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including Insulin glargine, may vary between individuals and within the same individual. Figure 1 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability After subcutaneous injection of Insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Metabolism and Elimination A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des-30 B -Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation. Special Populations Age, race, and gender Effect of age, race, and gender on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin glargine has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical trials in adults (n=3890) and a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients (n=349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between Insulin glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .

Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats and mice in acid vehicle containing groups and are considered a response to chronic tissue irritation and inflammation in rodents. These tumors were not found in female animals, in saline control, or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle. Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells (Ames and HGPRT-test) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations (cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters). In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which was approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day) maternal toxicity due to dose-dependent hypoglycemia, including some deaths, was observed.

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In mice and rats, standard two-year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0.455 mg/kg, which was for the rat approximately 65 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day) on a mg/kg basis. Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats and mice in acid vehicle containing groups and are considered a response to chronic tissue irritation and inflammation in rodents. These tumors were not found in female animals, in saline control, or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle. Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells (Ames and HGPRT-test) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations (cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters). In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which was approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day) maternal toxicity due to dose-dependent hypoglycemia, including some deaths, was observed. Consequently, a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high-dose group only. Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of Insulin glargine given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Tables 9\u201311). In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with Insulin glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), patients with type 1 diabetes (Study A n=585, Study B n=534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with Insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. In Study A, the average age was 39.2 years. The majority of patients were White (99%) and 55.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 24.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15.5 years. In Study B, the average age was 38.5 years. The majority of patients were White (95.3%) and 50.6% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17.4 years. In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 diabetes (n=619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with Insulin glargine or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 39.2 years. The majority of patients were White (96.9%) and 50.6% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 18.5 years. In these 3 studies, Insulin glargine and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 11.7 years. The majority of patients were White (96.8%) and 51.9% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 18.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 4.8 years. Similar effects on HbA1c (Table 10) were observed in both treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

The average age was 59.5 years. The majority of patients were White (92.8%) and 53.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 29.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10.3 years. Insulin glargine administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11). The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in Insulin glargine and NPH insulin treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications (n=518), a basal-bolus regimen of Insulin glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59.3 years. The majority of patients were White (80.7%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 13.7 years. Insulin glargine had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily Insulin glargine or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dose of Insulin glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started Insulin glargine at a dose that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dose. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the Insulin glargine and NPH insulin doses to a target fasting plasma glucose \u2264100 mg/dL. After the Insulin glargine or NPH insulin dose was adjusted, other antidiabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55.1 years. The majority of patients were White (85.3%) and 53.9% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10.8 years. The Insulin glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the Insulin glargine group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 40.9 years. All patients were White (100%) and 53.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17.3 years. Insulin glargine administered at different times of the day resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12 ). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to injection of Insulin glargine regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the Insulin glargine\u2013breakfast arm discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two arms discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of Insulin glargine administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n=697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 60.8 years. The majority of patients were White (96.6%) and 53.7% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10.1 years. Insulin glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as Insulin glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12 ).

The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for Insulin glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Insulin glargine was compared to NPH insulin in a 5-year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS). Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 years) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations, and indicate similarity of Insulin glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome.

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of Insulin glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 12,537 participants \u226550 years of age with abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular (i.e., CV) disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that Insulin glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard care. Two coprimary composite cardiovascular endpoints were used in ORIGIN. The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Participants were randomized to either Insulin glargine (N=6264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of \u226495 mg/dL or to standard care (N=6273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of participants were 75 years of age or older. The majority of participants were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were Caucasian, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m 2 . Approximately 12% of participants had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of participants had had a prior cardiovascular event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors. Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of participants randomized to Insulin glargine and standard care respectively at end of trial. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the trial was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the Insulin glargine and standard care group respectively. The median dose of Insulin glargine at end of trial was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to Insulin glargine were using Insulin glargine at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the Insulin glargine group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14 ). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

      "Instructions for Use Insulin glargine (IN-su-lin-GLAR-gine) injection for subcutaneous use 10 mL Vial (100 Units/mL, U-100) Read the Instructions for Use before you start taking Insulin glargine and each time you get a new Insulin glargine vial. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Insulin glargine syringes with other people even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Supplies needed to give your injection: an Insulin glargine 10 mL vial a U-100 insulin syringe and needle 2 alcohol swabs 1 sharps container for throwing away used needles and syringes. See \" Disposing of used needles and syringes \" at the end of these instructions. Preparing your Insulin glargine dose: Wash your hands with soap and water or with alcohol. Check the Insulin glargine label to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. Check the insulin to make sure it is clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin glargine if it is colored or cloudy, or if you see particles in the solution. Do not use Insulin glargine after the expiration date stamped on the label or 28 days after you first use it. Always use a syringe that is marked for U-100 insulin . If you use a syringe other than a U-100 insulin syringe, you may get the wrong dose of insulin. Always use a new syringe or needle for each injection. Do not re-use or share your syringes or needles with other people. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them. Step 1: If you are using a new vial, remove the protective cap. Do not remove the stopper. Step 2: Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. You do not have to shake the vial of Insulin glargine before use. Step 3: Draw air into the syringe equal to your insulin dose. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject the air into the vial. Step 4: Leave the syringe in the vial and turn both upside down. Hold the syringe and vial firmly in one hand. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin. With your free hand, pull the plunger to withdraw the correct dose into the syringe. Step 5: Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are in the syringe, hold the syringe straight up and tap the side of the syringe until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and draw insulin back in until you have the correct dose. Step 6: Remove the needle from the vial. Do not let the needle touch anything. You are now ready to inject. Giving your Insulin glargine injection: Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in the skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Step 7: Choosing your injection site: Insulin glargine is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper arm, thigh, or stomach area (abdomen). Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab to clean the injection site. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Step 8: Pinch the skin. Insert the needle in the way your healthcare provider showed you. Release the skin. Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the insulin. Leave the needle in the skin for about 10 seconds. Step 9: Pull the needle straight out of your skin. Gently press the injection site for several seconds. Do not rub the area. Do not recap the used needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle stick injury. Disposing of used needles and syringes: Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes.

      "Instructions for Use Insulin Glargine \u00ae SOLOSTAR \u00ae Single-Patient-Use Prefilled Pen (insulin glargine injection) Your healthcare professional has decided that SoloStar is right for you. Talk with your healthcare professional about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to follow all the instructions completely on your own, use SoloStar only if you have help from a person who is able to follow the instructions. Do not share your Insulin glargine SoloStar pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. People who are blind or have vision problems should not use Insulin glargine SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pen without help from a person trained to use Insulin glargine SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pen. Follow these instructions completely each time you use SoloStar to ensure that you get an accurate dose. If you do not follow these instructions you may get too much or too little insulin, which may affect your blood glucose. SoloStar is a disposable pen for the injection of insulin. Each SoloStar contains in total 300 units of insulin. You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. The pen plunger moves with each dose. The plunger will only move to the end of the cartridge when 300 units of insulin have been given. Keep this leaflet for future reference. If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your healthcare professional, go to www.winthropus.com or call sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610. Important information for use of SoloStar: Do not share your Insulin glargine SoloStar pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Do not re-use needles. Always attach a new needle before each use. BD Ultra-Fine \u00ae needles The brands listed are the registered trademarks of their respective owners and are not trademarks of sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC are compatible with SoloStar. These are sold separately and are manufactured by BD. Contact your healthcare professional for further information. Always perform the safety test before each injection. Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose (see \" Places to inject \" ). Places to inject Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Step 1. Check the insulin A. Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. The Insulin glargine SoloStar is grey with a purple injection button. B. Take off the pen cap. C. Check the appearance of your insulin. Insulin glargine is a clear insulin. Do not use this SoloStar if the insulin is cloudy, colored or has particles. Step 2. Attach the needle Do not re-use needles. Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination and potential needle blocks. A. Wipe the Rubber Seal with alcohol. B. Remove the protective seal from a new needle. C. Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, depending on the needle type). If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause leakage, or break the needle. Step 3. Perform a Safety test Always perform the safety test before each injection. Performing the safety test ensures that you get an accurate dose by: ensuring that pen and needle work properly removing air bubbles A. Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. B. Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the inner needle cap and discard it. C. Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. D. Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. E. Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen. If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to remove them. If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use this SoloStar. Step 4. Select the dose You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. A. Check that the dose window shows \"0\" following the safety test. B. Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. Step 5. Inject the dose A. Use the injection method as instructed by your healthcare professional. B. Insert the needle into the skin. C. Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window will return to \"0\" as you inject. D. Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. Step 6. Remove and discard the needle Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. This helps prevent: Contamination and/or infection. Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. A. Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing the needle. Follow recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (e.g., a one-handed capping technique) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of infectious diseases. B. Dispose of the needle safely. Used needles should be placed in sharps containers (such as red biohazard containers), hard plastic containers (such as detergent bottles), or metal containers (such as an empty coffee can). Such containers should be sealed and disposed of properly. If you are giving an injection to another person, you should remove the needle in an approved manner to avoid needle-stick injuries. C. Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. Storage Instructions Please check the leaflet for the insulin for complete instructions on how to store SoloStar. If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. Keep SoloStar out of the reach and sight of children. Keep your SoloStar in cool storage (36\u00b0F\u201346\u00b0F [2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C]) until first use. Do not allow it to freeze. Do not put it next to the freezer compartment of your refrigerator or next to a freezer pack. Once you take your SoloStar out of cool storage, for use or as a spare, you can use it for up to 28 days. During this time it can be safely kept at room temperature up to 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C). Do not use it after this time. SoloStar in use must not be stored in a refrigerator. Do not use SoloStar after the expiration date printed on the label of the pen or on the carton. Protect SoloStar from light. Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. Maintenance Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt. You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. Do not soak, wash, or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. Your SoloStar is designed to work accurately and safely. It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, glycemic control, type of diabetes, and prior insulin use. ( 2.2 ) Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time of day, but at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 2.3 ) and how to change to Insulin Glargine from other insulins ( 2.4 ) Closely monitor glucose when switching to Insulin Glargine and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is LANTUS (insulin glargine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Visually inspect Insulin Glargine vials and SoloStar prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Administer Insulin Glargine subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid, and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix Insulin Glargine with any other insulin or solution. The Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1-unit increments. Use Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Administer Insulin Glargine subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day. Individualize and adjust the dosage of Insulin Glargine based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), during acute illness, or changes in renal or hepatic function. Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin Glargine must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. 2.3 Initiation of Insulin Glargine Therapy Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements. Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. 2.4 Switching to Insulin Glargine from Other Insulin Therapies Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. When switching from: Once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) to once-daily Insulin Glargine (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is 80% of the TOUJEO dosage that is being discontinued. Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued. Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pen, insulin syringe, or needle between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen : Make changes to a patient's insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia : May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitant drugs, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia due to medication errors : Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin Glargine. Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 ) Hypokalemia : May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar Prefilled Pen, Insulin Syringe, or Needle Between Patients Insulin Glargine SoloStar prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Glargine vials must never re-use or share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins, including Insulin Glargine. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. The long-acting effect of Insulin Glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Glargine may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups among insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Glargine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Glargine; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. Insulin Glargine is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Glargine, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Insulin Glargine include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2,327 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Glargine or NPH in Studies A, B, C, and D [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 39 years, 54% were male, and mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.1 kg/m 2 . Ninety-seven percent were White, 2% were Black or African American and less than 1% were Asian. Approximately 3% of the patients in studies B and C were Hispanic. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1,563 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Glargine or NPH in Studies E, F, and G [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: the mean age was 59 years, 58% were male, and mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m 2 . Eighty-seven percent were White, 8% were Black or African American and 3% were Asian. Approximately 9 % of patients in Study F were Hispanic. The frequencies of adverse reactions during Insulin Glargine clinical studies in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below (Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 28 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=1,257) NPH, % (n=1,070) Upper respiratory tract infection 22.4 23.1 Infection Body system not specified 9.4 10.3 Accidental injury 5.7 6.4 Headache 5.5 4.7 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in Pooled Clinical Studies up to 1 Year Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=849) NPH, % (n=714) Upper respiratory tract infection 11.4 13.3 Infection Body system not specified 10.4 11.6 Retinal vascular disorder 5.8 7.4 Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u226510% in a 5-Year Study of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=514) NPH, % (n=503) Upper respiratory tract infection 29.0 33.6 Edema peripheral 20.0 22.7 Hypertension 19.6 18.9 Influenza 18.7 19.5 Sinusitis 18.5 17.9 Cataract 18.1 15.9 Bronchitis 15.2 14.1 Arthralgia 14.2 16.1 Pain in extremity 13.0 13.1 Back pain 12.8 12.3 Cough 12.1 7.4 Urinary tract infection 10.7 10.1 Diarrhea 10.7 10.3 Depression 10.5 9.7 Headache 10.3 9.3 Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in a 28-Week Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, % (n=174) NPH, % (n=175) Infection Body system not specified 13.8 17.7 Upper respiratory tract infection 13.8 16.0 Pharyngitis 7.5 8.6 Rhinitis 5.2 5.1 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia was the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with Insulin Glargine. Tables 5, 6, and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the Insulin Glargine clinical studies. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg/dL (\u226456 mg/dL in the 5-year study and \u226436 mg/dL in the ORIGIN study) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration. Percentages of Insulin Glargine\u2013treated adult patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Insulin Glargine clinical studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH-treated patients for all treatment regimens (see Tables 5 and 6 ). In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult studies with type 1 diabetes. Table 5: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine N=292 NPH N=293 Insulin Glargine N=264 NPH N=270 Insulin Glargine N=310 NPH N=309 Insulin Glargine N=174 NPH N=175 Percent of patients 10.6 15.0 8.7 10.4 6.5 5.2 23.0 28.6 Table 6: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin Insulin Glargine N=289 NPH N=281 Insulin Glargine N=259 NPH N=259 Insulin Glargine N=513 NPH N=504 Percent of patients 1.7 1.1 0.4 2.3 7.8 11.9 Table 7 displays the proportion of patients who experienced severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Insulin Glargine and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Table 7: Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Study ORIGIN Study Median duration of follow-up: 6.2 years Insulin Glargine N=6231 Standard Care N=6273 Percent of patients 5.6 1.8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking Insulin Glargine have experienced sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously, including Insulin Glargine, has resulted in lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulin including Insulin Glargine and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Hypersensitivity Reactions Local Reactions Patients taking Insulin Glargine experienced injection site reactions, including redness, pain, itching, urticaria, edema, and inflammation. In clinical studies in adult patients, there was a higher incidence of injection site pain in Insulin Glargine\u2013treated patients (2.7%) compared to NPH insulin-treated patients (0.7%). The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy. Systemic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, generalized skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, and shock have occurred with insulin, including Insulin Glargine and may be life threatening. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies. The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose. In clinical studies of Insulin Glargine, increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and Insulin Glargine treatment groups with similar incidences. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Insulin Glargine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors have been reported in which rapid-acting insulins and other insulins, have been accidentally administered instead of Insulin Glargine. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), on a mg/kg basis. In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 units/kg/day on a mg/kg basis, were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Insulin Glargine, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Glargine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients with diabetes mellitus have been established. Use of Insulin Glargine for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study (Study D) in 174 Insulin Glargine-treated pediatric patients aged 6 to 15 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and from adequate and well-controlled studies of Insulin Glargine in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . In the pediatric clinical study, pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in studies with type 1 diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with Insulin Glargine, 15% (n=316) were \u226565 years of age and 2% (n=42) were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Insulin Glargine have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine is administered to geriatric patients. In geriatric patients with diabetes, the initial dosing, dosage increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in geriatric patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Glargine has not been studied. Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine in patients with kidney impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Glargine has not been studied. Frequent glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary for Insulin Glargine in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]."

Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns or exercise may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia, continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine is a long-acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12). Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C-terminus of the B-chain. Insulin glargine has a molecular weight of 6063 Da. Insulin Glargine injection is a sterile, clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous use in a 10 mL multiple-dose vial or a 3 mL single-patient use prefilled pen (Insulin Glargine Solostar). Prefilled Pen (Insulin Glargine Solostar) and Vial: Each mL contains 100 units of insulin glargine and the inactive ingredients: glycerol 85% (20 mg), m-cresol (2.7 mg), zinc (30 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. The vial also contains polysorbate 20 (20 mcg). The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Insulin Glargine has a pH of approximately 4."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, the glucose-lowering effect on a molar basis (i.e., when given at the same doses) of intravenous Insulin Glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin. Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after subcutaneous injection of Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin. The median time between subcutaneous injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14.5 hours (range: 9.5 to 19.3 hours) for NPH insulin, and 24 hours (range: 10.8 to >24 hours) (24 hours was the end of the observation period) for Insulin Glargine. Figure 1: Glucose-Lowering Effect Over 24 Hours in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels The duration of action after abdominal, deltoid, or thigh subcutaneous administration of Insulin Glargine was similar. The time course of action of insulins, including Insulin Glargine, may vary between patients and within the same patient. Figure 1 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous injection of Insulin Glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes, the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower, more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration/time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin. Elimination Metabolism A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin, M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des-30 B -Thr-insulin). Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation. Specific Populations Age, Race, Body Mass Index, and Gender Effect of age, race, body mass index (BMI), and gender on the pharmacokinetics of insulin glargine has not been evaluated. However, in controlled clinical studies in adults (n=3,890) and a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients (n=349), subgroup analyses based on age, race, BMI, and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin [see Clinical Studies (14) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine given once-daily at bedtime was compared to that of once-daily and twice-daily NPH insulin in open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel studies of 2,327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1,563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see Tables 9\u201311). In general, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) with Insulin Glargine was similar to that with NPH insulin. 14.2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies (Studies A and B), adult patients with type 1 diabetes (Study A, n=585, Study B n=534) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin. Regular human insulin was administered before each meal. Insulin Glargine was administered at bedtime. NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily. In Study A, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (99%) and 56% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 24.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 16 years. In Study B, the average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (95%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.8 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. In another clinical study (Study C), patients with type 1 diabetes (n=619) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin. Insulin lispro was used before each meal. Insulin Glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 39 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 51% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.6 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 19 years. In these 3 adult studies, Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c (Table 9) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Insulin Glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily. The average age was 11.7 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 52% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 18.9 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 5 years. Similar effects on HbA1c (Table 10) were observed in both treatment groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

The average age was 60 years old. The majority of patients were White (93%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 29.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin Glargine administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11). The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in adult patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications (n=518), a basal-bolus regimen of Insulin Glargine once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as needed. The average age was 59 years. The majority of patients were White (81%) and 60% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 30.5 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 14 years. Insulin Glargine had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 11) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily Insulin Glargine or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started Insulin Glargine at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose \u2264100 mg/dL. After the Insulin Glargine or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted, other antidiabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55 years. The majority of patients were White (85%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The Insulin Glargine group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the Insulin Glargine group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .

Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime. The average age was 41 years. All patients were White (100%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 25.3 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 17 years. Insulin Glargine administered at pre-breakfast or at pre-dinner (both once daily) resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration (see Table 12 ). In these patients, data are available from 8-point home glucose monitoring. The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to Insulin Glargine injection regardless of time of administration. In this study, 5% of patients in the Insulin Glargine-breakfast group discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy. No patients in the other two groups (pre-dinner, bedtime) discontinued for this reason. The safety and efficacy of once daily Insulin Glargine administered pre-breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized, active-controlled clinical study (Study I, n=697) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy. All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily. The average age was 61 years. The majority of patients were White (97%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 28.7 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 10 years. Insulin Glargine given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as Insulin Glargine given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime (see Table 12 ).

Patients had type 2 diabetes (mean age 55 years) with no (86%) or mild (14%) retinopathy at baseline. Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.4%. The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint. Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures (pan-retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, local photocoagulation for new vessels, and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy) were also considered as 3-step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline. Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment. The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations, and indicate similarity of Insulin Glargine to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome. In this study, the numbers of retinal adverse events reported for Insulin Glargine and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of Insulin Glargine to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in 12,537 adults \u226550 years of age with: Abnormal glucose levels (i.e., impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and/or impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and Established CV disease or CV risk factors at baseline. The objective of the study was to demonstrate that Insulin Glargine use could significantly lower the risk of major CV outcomes compared to standard care. There were two coprimary composite CV endpoints: The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse CV event defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure. Patients were randomized to either Insulin Glargine (N=6,264) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of \u226495 mg/dL or to standard care (N=6,273). Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline. The mean age was 64 years and 8% of patients were 75 years of age or older. The majority of patients were male (65%). Fifty nine percent were White, 25% were Latin, 10% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. The median baseline BMI was 29 kg/m 2 . Approximately 12% of patients had abnormal glucose levels (IGT and/or IFG) at baseline and 88% had type 2 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, 59% were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug, 23% had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6% were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure. The mean HbA1c (SD) at baseline was 6.5% (1.0). Fifty-nine percent of the patients had had a prior CV event and 39% had documented coronary artery disease or other CV risk factors. Vital status was available for 99.9% and 99.8% of patients randomized to Insulin Glargine and standard care respectively at end of study. The median duration of follow-up was 6.2 years (range: 8 days to 7.9 years). The mean HbA1c (SD) at the end of the study was 6.5% (1.1) and 6.8% (1.2) in the Insulin Glargine and standard care group respectively. The median dose of Insulin Glargine at end of study was 0.45 U/kg. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to Insulin Glargine were using Insulin Glargine at end of the study. The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2.2 kg greater in the Insulin Glargine group than in the standard care group. Overall, the incidence of major adverse CV outcomes was similar between groups (see Table 14 ). All-cause mortality was also similar between groups.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). There are separate Instructions for Use for the Vial and Insulin Glargine SoloStar Pen. Never Share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar Prefilled Pen or insulin Syringe Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share an Insulin Glargine SoloStar pen with another person, even if the needle is changed. Advise patients using Insulin Glargine vials not to re-use or share needles or insulin syringes with another person. Sharing carries a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin. Inform patients of the symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., impaired ability to concentrate and react). This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Advise patients that changes in insulin regimen can predispose to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and that changes in insulin regimen should be made under close medical supervision [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypoglycemia Due to Medications Errors Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection to reduce the risk of a medication error [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients that hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with Insulin Glargine. Inform patients about the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] ."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Insulin Glargine (IN-su-lin-GLAR-gine) injection, for subcutaneous use VIAL: 100 units/mL (U-100) This product is LANTUS \u00ae (insulin glargine). These Instructions for Use contain information on how to inject Insulin Glargine using the vial. Read these Instructions for Use before you start taking Insulin Glargine and each time you get a new Insulin Glargine vial. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Do not share your Insulin Glargine syringes with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. Supplies Needed to Give Your Injection: an Insulin Glargine 10 mL vial a U-100 insulin syringe and needle 2 alcohol swabs 1 sharps container for throwing away used needles and syringes. See \" Disposing of used needles and syringes \" at the end of these instructions. Preparing to inject Insulin Glargine: Wash your hands with soap and water or clean your hands with alcohol. Check the Insulin Glargine label to make sure you are taking the right type of insulin. This is especially important if you use more than 1 type of insulin. Check the Insulin Glargine in the vial to make sure it is clear and colorless. Do not use Insulin Glargine if it is colored or cloudy, or if you see particles in the solution. Do not use Insulin Glargine after the expiration date stamped on the label or 28 days after you first use it. Always use a syringe that is marked for U-100 insulin . If you use a syringe other than a U-100 insulin syringe, you may get the wrong dose of Insulin Glargine. Always use a new syringe and a new needle for each injection to help prevent infections and prevent blocked needles. Step 1: If you are using a new Insulin Glargine vial, remove the protective cap. Do not remove the stopper. Step 2: Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. You do not have to shake the vial of Insulin Glargine before use. Step 3: Draw air into the syringe equal to your Insulin Glargine dose. Put the needle through the rubber top of the vial and push the plunger to inject the air into the vial. Step 4: Leave the syringe in the vial and turn both upside down. Hold the syringe and vial firmly in one hand. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the Insulin Glargine solution. With your free hand, pull the plunger to withdraw the correct dose into the syringe. Step 5: Before you take the needle out of the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are in the syringe, hold the syringe straight up and tap the side of the syringe until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and draw insulin back in until you have the correct dose. Step 6: Remove the needle from the vial. Do not let the needle touch anything. You are now ready to inject. Injecting Insulin Glargine: Inject your Insulin Glargine (with a syringe) exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Insulin Glargine is injected once daily at any time of the day but at the same time every day. Step 7: Choose your injection site: Insulin Glargine is injected under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper arms, thighs, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in the skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Wipe the skin with an alcohol swab to clean the injection site. Let the injection site dry before you inject your dose. Step 8: Pinch the skin. Insert the needle under the skin in the way your healthcare provider showed you. Release the skin. Slowly push in the plunger of the syringe all the way, making sure you have injected all the Insulin Glargine. Leave the needle in the skin for about 10 seconds. Step 9: Pull the needle straight out of your skin. Gently press the injection site for several seconds. Do not rub the area. Do not recap the used needle. Recapping the needle can lead to a needle-stick injury. Disposing of Used Needles and Syringes Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose (see \" Places to inject \" ). Learn to Inject Talk with your healthcare provider about how to inject before using your pen. Ask for help if you have problems handling the pen, for example if you have problems with your sight. Read all these instructions before using your pen. If you do not follow all these instructions, you may get too much or too little insulin. Need Help? If you have any questions about your pen or about diabetes, ask your healthcare provider, or go to www.winthropus.com or call sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610. Extra Items You Will Need a new sterile needle (see Step 2 ). an alcohol swab. a puncture-resistant container for used needles and pens. (See \" Throwing your pen away \" ) Places to Inject Inject your insulin exactly as your healthcare provider has shown you. Inject your insulin under the skin (subcutaneously) of your upper legs (thighs), upper arms, or stomach area (abdomen). Change (rotate) your injection sites within the area you choose for each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy (pits in skin or thickened skin) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (skin with lumps) at the injection sites. Do not inject where the skin has pits, is thickened, or has lumps. Do not inject where the skin is tender, bruised, scaly or hard, or into scars or damaged skin. Get to know your pen Step 1: Check your pen Take a new pen out of the refrigerator at least 1 hour before you inject. Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 1A Check the name and expiration date on the label of your pen. Make sure you have the correct insulin. Do not use your pen after the expiration date. 1B Pull off the pen cap. 1C Check that the insulin is clear. Do not use the pen if the insulin looks cloudy, colored or contains particles. 1D Wipe the rubber seal with an alcohol swab. If you have other injector pens: Making sure you have the correct medicine is especially important if you have other injector pens. Step 2: Attach a new needle Do not reuse needles. Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps stop blocked needles, contamination, and infection. Only use needles Other brands listed are the registered trademarks of their respective owners and are not trademarks of sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC. that are compatible for use with Insulin Glargine SoloStar, such as BD Ultra-Fine \u00ae . 2A Take a new needle and peel off the protective seal. 2B Keep the needle straight and screw it onto the pen until fixed. Do not over-tighten. 2C Pull off the outer needle cap. Keep this for later. 2D Pull off the inner needle cap and throw away. Handling needles Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Step 3: Do a safety test Always do a safety test before each injection to: Check your pen and the needle to make sure they are working properly. Make sure that you get the correct Insulin Glargine dose. 3A Select 2 units by turning the dose selector until the dose pointer is at the 2 mark. 3B Press the injection button all the way in. When insulin comes out of the needle tip, your pen is working correctly: If no insulin appears: You may need to repeat this step up to 3 times before seeing insulin. If no insulin comes out after the third time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: \u2013 change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ), \u2013 then repeat the safety test ( Step 3 ). Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. If you see air bubbles: You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. Step 4: Select the dose Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen. 4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to \"0.\" 4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose. If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left. If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, use a new pen or inject the remaining units and use a new pen to complete your dose. How to read the dose window Even numbers are shown in line with dose pointer. Odd numbers are shown as a line between even numbers. Units of Insulin Glargine in your pen: Your pen contains a total of 300 units of Insulin Glargine. You can select doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains more than 1 dose. You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale. Step 5: Injecting Your Insulin Glargine Dose If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. See the section below for help. 5A Choose a place to inject as shown in the picture above. 5B Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider. Do not touch the injection button yet. 5C Place your thumb on the injection button. Then press all the way in and hold. Do not press at an angle. Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 5D Keep the injection button held in and when you see \"0\" in the dose window, slowly count to 10. This will make sure you get your full dose. 5E After holding and slowly counting to 10, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin. If you find it hard to press the button in: Change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ) then do a safety test (see Step 3 ). If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. Step 6: Remove the needle Take care when handling needles to prevent needle-stick injury and cross-infection. Do not put the inner needle cap back on. 6A Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap. Then push firmly on. The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. 6B Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle. Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. 6C Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see \" Throwing your pen away \" at the end of this Instructions for Use). 6D Put your pen cap back on. Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. Storing the Insulin Glargine Solostar Pen Before first use Keep new pens in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C) . Do not freeze. Do not use Insulin Glargine if it has been frozen. After first use Keep your pen at room temperature below 86\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) . Keep your pen away from heat or light.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dose based on type of diabetes, metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. ( 2.2 ) Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid once daily at any time during the day, at the same time every day. ( 2.1 ) Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 2.3 ) and how to switch to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other insulins ( 2.4 ) Closely monitor glucose when switching to Insulin Glargine, U-300 and during initial weeks thereafter. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Always check insulin labels before administration. This product is TOUJEO (insulin glargine). [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Visually inspect the Insulin Glargine, U-300 solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles. Inject Insulin Glargine, U-300 subcutaneously into the abdominal area, thigh, or deltoid. Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Use Insulin Glargine, U-300 with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose. Do not administer Insulin Glargine, U-300 intravenously or in an insulin pump. Do not dilute or mix Insulin Glargine, U-300 with any other insulin products or solutions. Never transfer Insulin Glargine, U-300 from the cartridges of the Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen into a syringe for administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . 2.2 General Dosing Instructions Insulin Glargine, U-300 is available in 2 single-patient-use prefilled pens: The Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar prefilled pen contains 450 units of insulin glargine. It delivers doses in 1-unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection. The Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen contains 900 units of insulin glargine. It delivers doses in 2-unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection. It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day. When changing between Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar and Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar, if the patient's previous dose was an odd number, the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen. The dose counter of the Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of Insulin Glargine, U-300 to be injected and no conversion is required. Inject Insulin Glargine, U-300 subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day. During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Individualize and titrate the dosage of Insulin Glargine, U-300 based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal. Titrate the dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days. Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . 2.3 Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes. The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . When initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose daily. Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily. 2.4 Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start Insulin Glargine, U-300 at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage. When switching patients to Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share an Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Max SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pen between patients, even if the needle is changed. ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient's insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitant drugs, meal pattern, physical activity, and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness. ( 5.3 , 6.1 ) Hypoglycemia Due to Medication errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection. ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue Insulin Glargine, U-300, monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Never Share an Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar Pen Between Patients Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pens must never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Pen sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed. Changing to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other Insulin Therapies On a unit-to-unit basis, Insulin Glargine, U-300 has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . In clinical trials, patients who changed to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300 monitor glucose daily, titrate Insulin Glargine, U-300 as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] . 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine, U-300. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may be life-threatening, or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving, or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly, and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic neuropathy, in patients using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions (7) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. The long-acting effect of an Insulin Glargine, U-300 may delay recovery from hypoglycemia compared to shorter-acting insulins. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin formulation. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Glargine, U-300 may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, do not administer Insulin Glargine, U-300 intravenously, intramuscularly or in an insulin pump, or dilute or mix with any other insulin products or solutions. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between Insulin Glargine, U-300 and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. To avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, never use a syringe to remove Insulin Glargine, U-300 from the Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen into a syringe [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Glargine, U-300. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Glargine, U-300; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Insulin Glargine, U-300 is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or any of the excipients in Insulin Glargine, U-300. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Glargine, U-300, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia, if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Glargine, U-300, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere: Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 (\u22655%) are: Hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain. ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 304 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Glargine, U-300 with mean exposure duration of 23 weeks. The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 46 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-five percent were male, 86% were White, 5% were Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 82 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 35% of patients had eGFR \u226590 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28 kg/m 2 . HbA1c at baseline was greater than or equal to 8% in 58% of patients. The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1242 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Glargine, U-300 with mean exposure duration of 25 weeks. The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics: Mean age was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 13 years. Fifty-three percent were male, 88% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 17% were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, mean eGFR was 79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 27% of patients had an eGFR \u226590 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The mean BMI was 35 kg/m 2 . HbA1c at baseline was greater than or equal to 8% in 66% of patients. Insulin Glargine, U-300 was studied in 233 pediatric patients (6\u201317 years of age) with type 1 diabetes for a mean duration of 26 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Common adverse reactions (occurring \u22655%) in Insulin Glargine, U-300-treated subjects during clinical trials in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Common adverse reactions for Insulin Glargine, U-300-treated pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus were similar to the adverse reactions listed in Table 1. Hypoglycemia is discussed in a dedicated subsection below. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in Two Pooled Clinical Trials of 26 Weeks and 16 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, U-300 + Mealtime Insulin \"mealtime insulin\" refers to insulin glulisine, insulin lispro, or insulin aspart. , % (n=304) Nasopharyngitis 12.8 Upper respiratory tract infection 9.5 Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring \u22655% in Three Pooled Clinical Trials of 26 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Insulin Glargine, U-300 one of the trials in type 2 diabetes included mealtime insulin. , % (n=1242) Nasopharyngitis 7.1 Upper respiratory tract infection 5.7 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Glargine, U-300 with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. In the Insulin Glargine, U-300 adult program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action. In the pediatric program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with semiconsciousness, unconsciousness, coma and/or convulsions in a patient who had altered mental status and could not assist in his own care, and who may have required glucagon or intravenous glucose. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 1 diabetes receiving Insulin Glargine, U-300 as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6.6% at 26 weeks. The incidence of hypoglycemia with a glucose level less than 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms was 77.7% at 26 weeks. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes receiving Insulin Glargine, U-300 as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6% at 26 weeks and the incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg/dL regardless of symptoms was 80.3%. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 2 diabetes was 5% at 26 weeks in patients receiving Insulin Glargine, U-300 as part of a multiple daily injection regimen, and 1.0% and 0.9% respectively at 26 weeks in the two studies where patients received Insulin Glargine, U-300 as part of a basal-insulin only regimen. The incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg/dL regardless of symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving Insulin Glargine, U-300 ranged from 9% to 44.6% at 26 weeks and the highest risk was again seen in patients receiving Insulin Glargine, U-300 as part of a multiple daily injection regimen. Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Peripheral Edema Insulin, including Insulin Glargine, U-300, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Insulin Glargine, U-300, can cause lipoatrophy (depression in the skin) or lipohypertrophy (enlargement or thickening of tissue) in some patients and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulins including Insulin Glargine, U-300 and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients taking Insulin Glargine, U-300 experienced erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the site of injection. These conditions were usually self-limiting. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In a 6-month study of type 1 diabetes patients, 79% of patients who received Insulin Glargine, U-300 once daily were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the study, including 62% that were positive at baseline and 44% of patients who developed antidrug antibody (i.e., anti-insulin glargine antibody [ADA]) during the study. Eighty percent of the AIA-positive patients on Insulin Glargine, U-300 with antibody test at baseline remained AIA positive at month 6. In two 6-month studies in type 2 diabetes patients, 25% of patients who received Insulin Glargine, U-300 once daily were positive for AIA at least once during the study, including 42% who were positive at baseline and 20% of patients who developed ADA during the study. Ninety percent of the AIA-positive patients on Insulin Glargine, U-300 with antibody test at baseline, remained AIA positive at month 6. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as: assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Glargine, U-300 with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Insulin Glargine, U-300. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dose of 0.2 unit/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 Units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day). In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 Units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine in human milk, the effects on breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Endogenous insulin is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Insulin Glargine, U-300, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Glargine, U-300 or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine, U-300 to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with diabetes mellitus have been established. The use of Insulin Glargine, U-300 for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 463 pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with type 1 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The safety and effectiveness of Insulin Glargine, U-300 have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age. 8.5 Geriatric Use In controlled clinical studies, 30 of 304 (9.8%) Insulin Glargine, U-300-treated patients with type 1 diabetes and 327 of 1242 (26.3%) Insulin Glargine, U-300-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were \u226565 years of age, among them 2.0% of the patients with type 1 and 3.0% of the patients with type 2 diabetes were \u226575 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Insulin Glargine, U-300 have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when Insulin Glargine, U-300 is administered to geriatric patients.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes (see Data ) . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis, respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dose of 0.2 unit/kg/day. Overall, the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin (see Data ) . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to 10% in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with a peri-conceptional HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre-gestational diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups. Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits. Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating, during mating, and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0.36 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 Units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day). In rabbits, doses of 0.072 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0.2 Units/kg/day (0.007 mg/kg/day), were administered during organogenesis. The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits. However, in rabbits, five fetuses from two litters of the high-dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles. Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal."

Lowering the insulin dosage, and adjustments in meal patterns, or physical activity level may be needed. More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine is a long-acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a nonpathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines remain at the C-terminus of the B-chain. Insulin glargine has a molecular weight of 6063 Da. Insulin Glargine, U-300 injection is a sterile, clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous injection. Each mL of Insulin Glargine, U-300 contains 300 units of insulin glargine dissolved in a clear aqueous fluid. The 1.5 mL Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar prefilled pen presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL: glycerin (20 mg), metacresol (2.7 mg), zinc (90 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. The 3 mL Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar prefilled pen presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL: glycerin (20 mg), metacresol (2.7 mg), zinc (90 mcg), and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Insulin Glargine, U-300 has a pH of approximately 4."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Onset of Action The pharmacodynamic profiles for Insulin Glargine, U-300 given subcutaneously as a single dose of 0.4, 0.6, or 0.9 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that on average, the onset of action develops over 6 hours post dose for all three single doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300. Single-Dose Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. On a unit-to-unit basis, Insulin Glargine, U-300 had a lower maximum (GIR max ) and 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC 0\u201324 ) compared to LANTUS. The overall glucose lowering effect of Insulin Glargine, U-300 0.4 U/kg was 12% of the glucose lowering effect of an equivalent dose of LANTUS. Glucose lowering at least 30% of the effect of a single 0.4 U/kg dose of LANTUS was not observed until the single dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 exceeded 0.6 U/kg. Multiple Once-Daily Dose Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of Insulin Glargine, U-300 after 8 days of daily injection was evaluated in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. At steady state, the 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC 0\u201324 ) of Insulin Glargine, U-300 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The glucose lowering effect of an Insulin Glargine, U-300 dose increased with each daily administration. The pharmacodynamic profile for Insulin Glargine, U-300 given subcutaneously as multiple once-daily subcutaneous injections of 0.4 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Glucose Infusion Rate in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes in Multiple-Dose Administration of Insulin Glargine, U-300 Glucose infusion rate: determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels. Figure 1 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 (8\u201314), 12 (12\u201318), and 16 (12\u201320) hours, respectively. Mean serum insulin concentrations declined to the lower limit of quantitation of 5.02 \u00b5U/mL by 16, 28, and beyond 36 hours, respectively. Steady-state insulin concentrations are reached by at least 5 days of once-daily subcutaneous administration of 0.4 U/kg to 0.6 U/kg doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 over 8 days in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. After subcutaneous injection of Insulin Glargine, U-300, the intra-subject variability, defined as the coefficient of variation for the insulin exposure during 24 hours, was 21.0% at steady state. Elimination After subcutaneous injection of Insulin Glargine, U-300 in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B-chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 (21 A -Gly-insulin) and M2 (21 A -Gly-des-30 B -Thr-insulin). The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of human insulin. Specific Populations Pediatrics Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for Insulin Glargine, U-300 based on concentration data of its main metabolite M1 using data from 75 pediatric patients (6 to <18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes. The findings with regard to the effect of body weight on systemic exposure of M1 are generally consistent with findings in adults. Elderly, Race, Sex, and Obesity Effect of age \u226565, race, and sex on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Glargine, U-300 has not been evaluated. When weight is taken into account as a covariate on clearance, BMI is not an additional covariate."

At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with Insulin Glargine, U-300 titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of Insulin Glargine, U-300 than LANTUS. 14.2 Clinical Study in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n=546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. Insulin Glargine, U-300 and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m 2 . At week 26, treatment with Insulin Glargine, U-300 provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with Insulin Glargine, U-300 used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when Insulin Glargine, U-300 was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e., ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]). In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups."

Pen sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia Inform patients that hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction with insulin. Inform patients of the symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., impaired ability to concentrate and react). This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ] . Advise patients that changes in insulin regimen can predispose to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and that changes in insulin regimen should be made under close medical supervision [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Inform patients that if they change to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other basal insulins they may experience higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy. Advise patients to monitor glucose daily when initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The \"300 units/mL (U-300)\" is highlighted in honey gold on the labels of Insulin Glargine, U-300 and Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pens. Inform patients that Insulin Glargine, U-300 contains 300 units of insulin glargine per mL (U-300) compared to formulations of insulin glargine that contain100 units/mL (U-100). To avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, instruct patients to never use a syringe to remove Insulin Glargine, U-300 from the Insulin Glargine, U-300 SoloStar or Max SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Inform patients that the dose counter of Insulin Glargine, U-300, SoloStar or Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar single-patient-use prefilled pen shows the number of units of Insulin Glargine, U-300 to be injected and no dose recalculation is required [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.4) ] . Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients that hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with Insulin Glargine, U-300. Inform patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]."

If no insulin comes out after the sixth time, the needle may be blocked. If this happens: \u2013 change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ), \u2013 then repeat the safety test (see Step 3 ). Do not use your pen if there is still no insulin coming out of the needle tip. Use a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. If you see air bubbles You may see air bubbles in the insulin. This is normal, they will not harm you. Step 4: Select the dose Do not select a dose or press the injection button without a needle attached. This may damage your pen. Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar is made to deliver the number of insulin units that your healthcare provider prescribed. You do not need to do any dose calculations . The dose selector of your Insulin Glargine, U-300 Max SoloStar pen dials by 2 units and can only dial even doses of insulin. 4A Make sure a needle is attached and the dose is set to \"0.\" 4B Turn the dose selector until the dose pointer lines up with your dose. Set the dose by turning the dose selector to a line in the dose window. Each line equals 2 units. The dose selector clicks as you turn it. Always check the number in the dose window to make sure you dialed the correct dose. Do not dial your dose by counting the clicks. You may dial the wrong dose. This may lead to you getting too much insulin or not enough insulin. If you turn past your dose, you can turn back down. If there are not enough units left in your pen for your dose, the dose selector will stop at the number of units left. If you cannot select your full prescribed dose, split the dose into 2 injections or use a new pen. If you use a new pen, perform a safety test (see Step 3 ) How to read the dose window The dose selector dials by 2 units. Each line in the dose window is an even number. 60 units selected 58 units selected Units of insulin in your pen Your pen contains a total of 900 units of insulin. You can select doses from 2 to 160 units. The dose is adjusted by 2 units at a time. Each pen contains more than 1 dose. You can see roughly how many units of insulin are left by looking at where the plunger is on the insulin scale. Step 5: Inject your dose If you find it hard to press the injection button in, do not force it as this may break your pen. See the section below for help. 5A Choose a place to inject as shown in the picture labeled \"Places to inject.\" The site you choose for the injection should be clean and dry. If your skin is dirty, clean it as instructed by your healthcare provider. 5B Push the needle into your skin as shown by your healthcare provider. Do not touch the injection button yet. 5C Place your thumb on the injection button. Then press all the way in and hold. Do not press at an angle. Your thumb could block the dose selector from turning. 5D Keep the injection button held in and when you see \"0\" in the dose window, slowly count to 5. This will make sure you get your full dose. 5E After holding and slowly counting to 5, release the injection button. Then remove the needle from your skin. If you find it hard to press the injection button in: Change the needle (see Step 6 and Step 2 ) then do a safety test (see Step 3 ). If you still find it hard to press in, get a new pen. Do not use a syringe to remove insulin from your pen. Step 6: Remove the needle Take care when handling needles to prevent needle injury and cross-infection. Do not put the inner needle cap back on. 6A Grip the widest part of the outer needle cap. Keep the needle straight and guide it into the outer needle cap. Then push firmly on. The needle can puncture the cap if it is recapped at an angle. 6B Grip and squeeze the widest part of the outer needle cap. Turn your pen several times with your other hand to remove the needle. Try again if the needle does not come off the first time. 6C Throw away the used needle in a puncture-resistant container (see \" Throwing your pen away \" at the end of this Instructions for Use). 6D Put the pen cap back on. Do not put the pen back in the refrigerator. Use by Only use your pen for up to 56 days after its first use.
