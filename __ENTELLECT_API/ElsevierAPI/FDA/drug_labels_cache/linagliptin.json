      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic acidosis: See boxed warning ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia: Consider lowering the dosage of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions) have occurred with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. If hypersensitivity reactions occur discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking linagliptin. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous pemphigoid : There have been reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. ( 5.7 ) Heart failure: Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor for signs and symptoms. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis Metformin There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. In linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] : \u2022 Before initiating linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \u2022 Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ]. \u2022 Initiation of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . \u2022 Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \u2022 In patients taking linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7 )]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 )]. Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, has been reported in patients treated with linagliptin. In the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )], acute pancreatitis was reported in 9 (0.3%) patients treated with linagliptin and in 5 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo. Two patients treated with linagliptin in the CARMELINA trial had acute pancreatitis with a fatal outcome. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients treated with linagliptin. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . Therefore, a lower dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred predominantly within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with linagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes mellitus. Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. 5.5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] . 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking linagliptin. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Bullous pemphigoid was reported in 7 (0.2%) patients treated with linagliptin compared to none in patients treated with placebo in the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2 )] , and 3 of these patients were hospitalized due to bullous pemphigoid. Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 5.8 Heart Failure An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride."

Linagliptin/Metformin The safety of concomitantly administered linagliptin (daily dosage 5 mg) and metformin (mean daily dosage of approximately 1,800 mg) has been evaluated in 2,816 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for \u226512 weeks in clinical trials. Three placebo-controlled trials with linagliptin + metformin were conducted: 2 studies were 24 weeks in duration, 1 trial was 12 weeks in duration. In the 3 placebo-controlled clinical studies, adverse reactions which occurred in \u22655% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformin (n=875) and were more common than in patients given placebo+ metformin (n=539) included nasopharyngitis (5.7% vs 4.3%). In a 24-week factorial design trial, adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients receiving linagliptin + metformin and were more common than in patients given placebo are shown in Table 1.

Linagliptin Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo included: nasopharyngitis (7% vs 6.1%), diarrhea (3.3% vs 3%), and cough (2.1% vs 1.4%). Rates for other adverse reactions for linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo when linagliptin was used in combination with specific anti-diabetic agents were: urinary tract infection (3.1% vs 0%) and hypertriglyceridemia (2.4% vs 0%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to sulfonylurea; hyperlipidemia (2.7% vs 0.8%) and weight increased (2.3% vs 0.8%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to pioglitazone; and constipation (2.1% vs 1%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to basal insulin therapy. Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin monotherapy were hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity) and myalgia. In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with linagliptin compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin. Metformin The most common (>5%) adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. Other Adverse Reactions Hypoglycemia Linagliptin/Metformin In a 24-week factorial design trial, hypoglycemia was reported in 4 (1.4%) of 286 subjects treated with linagliptin + metformin, 6 (2.1%) of 291 subjects treated with metformin, and 1 (1.4%) of 72 subjects treated with placebo. The incidence of hypoglycemia with plasma glucose <54 mg/dL was 8.1% in the linagliptin group (N=792) compared to 5.3% in the placebo group (N=263) when administered in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea in a 24-week trial. Linagliptin The incidence of severe hypoglycemia (requiring assistance) was 1.7% in the linagliptin group (N=631) compared to 1.1% in the placebo group (N=630) when administered in combination with basal insulin in a 52-week trial. Laboratory Test Abnormalities in Clinical Trials of Linagliptin or Metformin Linagliptin Increase in Uric Acid: Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequently in the linagliptin group and \u22651% more than in the placebo group were increases in uric acid (1.3% in the placebo group, 2.7% in the linagliptin group). Increase in Lipase: In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with linagliptin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria, a mean increase of 30% in lipase concentrations from baseline to 24 weeks was observed in the linagliptin arm compared to a mean decrease of 2% in the placebo arm. Lipase levels above 3 times upper limit of normal were seen in 8.2% compared to 1.7% patients in the linagliptin and placebo arms, respectively. Increase in Amylase: In a cardiovascular safety trial comparing linagliptin versus glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, amylase levels above 3 times upper limit of normal were seen in 1% compared to 0.5% of patients in the linagliptin and glimepiride arms, respectively. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase and amylase with linagliptin is unknown in the absence of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 )]. Metformin Decrease in Vitamin B 12 : In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Linagliptin \u2022 Gastrointestinal Disorders: Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1 )] , mouth ulceration, stomatitis \u2022 Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions \u2022 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis, severe and disabling arthralgia \u2022 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Bullous pemphigoid, rash Metformin \u2022 Hepatobiliary Disorders: Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 2 describes clinically relevant interactions with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Table 2 Clinically Relevant Interactions with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact Topiramate or other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Intervention Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. Intervention Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Alcohol Clinical Impact Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Intervention Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride is used in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin. Intervention Coadministration of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require lower dosages of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. Intervention When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycemic control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. Inducers of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 Enzymes Clinical Impact Rifampin decreased linagliptin exposure, suggesting that the efficacy of linagliptin may be reduced when administered in combination with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer. Intervention Use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended when linagliptin is to be administered with a strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inducer. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors: May increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7 ) Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance: May increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider benefits and risks of concomitant use. (7 ) Alcohol: Can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. ( 7 ) Strong P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 Inducer: Efficacy may be reduced when administered in combination (e.g., rifampin). Use of alternative treatments is strongly recommended. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride and linagliptin use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride-associated or linagliptin-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defector miscarriage risk [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when the combination of linagliptin and metformin was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the maximum recommended clinical dose, based on exposure [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6% to10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c>7 and has been reported to be as high as 20% to 25% in women with HbA1c>10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from postmarketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Linagliptin and metformin, the components of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride, were coadministered to pregnant Wistar Han rats during the period of organogenesis. No adverse developmental outcome was observed at doses similar to the maximum recommended clinical dose, based on exposure. At higher doses associated with maternal toxicity, the metformin component of the combination was associated with an increased incidence of fetal rib and scapula malformations at \u22659-times a 2,000 mg clinical dose, based on exposure. Linagliptin No adverse developmental outcome was observed when linagliptin was administered to pregnant Wistar Han rats and Himalayan rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses represent approximately 943-times (rats) and 1,943-times (rabbits) the 5 mg maximum clinical dose, based on exposure. No adverse functional, behavioral, or reproductive outcome was observed in offspring following administration of linagliptin to Wistar Han rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 at a dose 49-times the maximum recommended human dose, based on exposure. Linagliptin crosses the placenta into the fetus following oral dosing in pregnant rats and rabbits. Metformin HCl Metformin HCl did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of approximately 2- and 6-times a clinical dose of 2,000 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is limited information regarding the presence of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride or its components (linagliptin or metformin) in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, linagliptin is present in rat milk. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data]. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride have not been established in pediatric patients. \"Pediatric information describing a clinical study in which efficacy was not demonstrated is approved for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s Jentadueto\u00ae (Linagliptin; Metformin hydrochloride) Tablets. However, due to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.\" 8.5 Geriatric Use Linagliptin is minimally excreted by the kidney; however, metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Linagliptin In linagliptin studies, 1,085 linagliptin-treated patients were 65 years of age and older and 131 patients were 75 years of age and older. In these linagliptin studies, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness of linagliptin were observed between geriatric patients and younger adult patients. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Contraindications (4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ), Contraindications (4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 )]. In the linagliptin treatment arm of the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], 2,200 (63%) patients had renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Approximately 20% of the population had eGFR \u226545 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 28% of the population had eGFR \u226530 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 15% had eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The overall incidence of adverse reactions were generally similar between the linagliptin and placebo treatment arms. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Linagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride contains: linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin, a biguanide. Linagliptin Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Metformin HCl Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Linagliptin Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in a better regulation of the glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and selectively inhibits DPP-4, but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100 mg dose. At the 100 mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5 mg dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Linagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Administration of linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin HCl 1,000 mg fixed-dose combination with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of linagliptin. There was no change in metformin AUC; however, mean peak serum concentration of metformin was decreased by 18% when administered with food. A delayed time-to-peak serum concentrations by 2 hours was observed for metformin under fed conditions. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant. Absorption Linagliptin The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Following oral administration, plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in at least a biphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (>100 hours), related to the saturable binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. However, the prolonged elimination does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of linagliptin 5 mg, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin 5 mg are reached by the third dose, and C max and AUC increased by a factor of 1.3 at steady-state compared with the first dose. Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin is similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin HCl The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Distribution Linagliptin The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state following a single intravenous dose of linagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects is approximately 1,110 L, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75% to 89% at \u226530 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high concentrations, where DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70% to 80% of linagliptin remains bound to plasma proteins and 20% to 30% is unbound in plasma. Plasma binding is not altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Metformin HCl The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654\u00b1358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Elimination Linagliptin : Linagliptin has a terminal half-life of about 200 hours at steady-state, though the accumulation half-life is about 11 hours. Renal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min. Metformin HCl: Metformin has a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Linagliptin : Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linagliptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linagliptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite, which shows a steady-state exposure of 13.3% relative to linagliptin. Metformin HCl: Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Linagliptin : Following administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated via the enterohepatic system (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Metformin HCl: Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is excreted via the renal route within the first 24 hours. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride in renally impaired patients have not been performed. Linagliptin : Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In patients with moderate renal impairment under steady-state conditions, mean exposure of linagliptin increased (AUC \u03c4,ss by 71% and C max by 46%) compared with healthy subjects. This increase was not associated with a prolonged accumulation half-life, terminal half-life, or an increased accumulation factor. Renal excretion of linagliptin was below 5% of the administered dose and was not affected by decreased renal function. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than that of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUC by 42% and C max by 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitus groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose. These findings were further supported by the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. Metformin HCl: In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4 ) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Hepatic Impairment Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride in hepatically impaired patients have not been performed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Linagliptin: In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) steady-state exposure (AUC\u03c4,ss) of linagliptin was approximately 25% lower and Cmax,ss was approximately 36% lower than in healthy subjects. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), AUCss of linagliptin was about 14% lower and C max,ss was approximately 8% lower than in healthy subjects. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) had comparable exposure of linagliptin in terms of AUC 0-24 and approximately 23% lower C max compared with healthy subjects. Reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters seen in patients with hepatic impairment did not result in reductions in DPP-4 inhibition. Metformin HCl: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Linagliptin : Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics of linagliptin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Metformin HCl: Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared with healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin HCl in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Caucasians (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interactions Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Linagliptin In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Linagliptin is a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes and is not an inducer of CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 4A11. Linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and inhibits P-gp mediated transport of digoxin at high concentrations. Based on these results and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates at therapeutic concentrations. In vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Strong inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp (e.g., rifampin) decrease exposure to linagliptin to subtherapeutic and likely ineffective concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7 )]. In vivo studies indicated evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Linagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride contains: linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin, a biguanide. Linagliptin Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Metformin HCl Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Linagliptin Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in a better regulation of the glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and selectively inhibits DPP-4, but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100 mg dose. At the 100 mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5 mg dose."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Linagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride Administration of linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin HCl 1,000 mg fixed-dose combination with food resulted in no change in overall exposure of linagliptin. There was no change in metformin AUC; however, mean peak serum concentration of metformin was decreased by 18% when administered with food. A delayed time-to-peak serum concentrations by 2 hours was observed for metformin under fed conditions. These changes are not likely to be clinically significant. Absorption Linagliptin The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Following oral administration, plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in at least a biphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (>100 hours), related to the saturable binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. However, the prolonged elimination does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of linagliptin 5 mg, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin 5 mg are reached by the third dose, and C max and AUC increased by a factor of 1.3 at steady-state compared with the first dose. Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin is similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin HCl The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Distribution Linagliptin The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state following a single intravenous dose of linagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects is approximately 1,110 L, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75% to 89% at \u226530 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high concentrations, where DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70% to 80% of linagliptin remains bound to plasma proteins and 20% to 30% is unbound in plasma. Plasma binding is not altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Metformin HCl The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654\u00b1358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. Elimination Linagliptin : Linagliptin has a terminal half-life of about 200 hours at steady-state, though the accumulation half-life is about 11 hours. Renal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min. Metformin HCl: Metformin has a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Linagliptin : Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linagliptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linagliptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite, which shows a steady-state exposure of 13.3% relative to linagliptin. Metformin HCl: Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Linagliptin : Following administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated via the enterohepatic system (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Metformin HCl: Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is excreted via the renal route within the first 24 hours. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Renal Impairment Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride in renally impaired patients have not been performed. Linagliptin : Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In patients with moderate renal impairment under steady-state conditions, mean exposure of linagliptin increased (AUC \u03c4,ss by 71% and C max by 46%) compared with healthy subjects. This increase was not associated with a prolonged accumulation half-life, terminal half-life, or an increased accumulation factor. Renal excretion of linagliptin was below 5% of the administered dose and was not affected by decreased renal function. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than that of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUC by 42% and C max by 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitus groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose. These findings were further supported by the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. Metformin HCl: In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4 ) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Hepatic Impairment Linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride: Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin and metformin after administration of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride in hepatically impaired patients have not been performed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )]. Linagliptin: In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) steady-state exposure (AUC\u03c4,ss) of linagliptin was approximately 25% lower and Cmax,ss was approximately 36% lower than in healthy subjects. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), AUCss of linagliptin was about 14% lower and C max,ss was approximately 8% lower than in healthy subjects. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) had comparable exposure of linagliptin in terms of AUC 0-24 and approximately 23% lower C max compared with healthy subjects. Reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters seen in patients with hepatic impairment did not result in reductions in DPP-4 inhibition. Metformin HCl: No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Linagliptin : Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics of linagliptin [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Metformin HCl: Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared with healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin HCl in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Caucasians (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interactions Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. Linagliptin In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Linagliptin is a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes and is not an inducer of CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 4A11. Linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and inhibits P-gp mediated transport of digoxin at high concentrations. Based on these results and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates at therapeutic concentrations. In vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Strong inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp (e.g., rifampin) decrease exposure to linagliptin to subtherapeutic and likely ineffective concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7 )]. In vivo studies indicated evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Linagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride No carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of linagliptin and metformin HCl. Linagliptin Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in male and female rats in a 2-year study at doses of 6, 18, and 60 mg/kg. The highest dose of 60 mg/kg is approximately 418 times the clinical dose of 5 mg/day based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice in a 2-year study at doses up to 80 mg/kg (males) and 25 mg/kg (females), or approximately 35 and 270 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure. Higher doses of linagliptin in female mice (80 mg/kg) increased the incidence of lymphoma at approximately 215 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In fertility studies in rats, linagliptin had no adverse effects on early embryonic development, mating, fertility, or bearing live young up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg (approximately 943 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure). Metformin HCl Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1,500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,000 mg/kg/day based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium) , gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Initial Combination Therapy with Linagliptin and Metformin A total of 791 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in the 24-week, randomized, double-blind, portion of this placebo-controlled factorial trial designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin as initial therapy with metformin. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (52%) underwent a drug washout period of 4 weeks\u2019 duration. After the washout period and after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657% to \u226410.5%) were randomized. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657.5% to <11%) not on antihyperglycemic agents at trial entry (48%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Randomization was stratified by baseline A1C (<8.5% vs \u22658.5%) and use of a prior oral antidiabetic drug (none vs monotherapy). Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2:2 ratio to either placebo or one of 5 active-treatment arms. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 5 mg of linagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1,000 mg of metformin twice daily, or 2.5 mg of linagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1,000 mg of metformin twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin rescue therapy. Initial therapy with the combination of linagliptin and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to linagliptin alone (Table 7, Figure 1). The adjusted mean treatment difference in A1C from baseline to week 24 (LOCF) was -0.5% (95% CI -0.7, -0.3; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg twice daily compared to metformin 1,000 mg twice daily; -1.1% (95% CI -1.4, -0.9; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily; -0.6% (95% CI -0.8, -0.4; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to metformin 500 mg twice daily; and -0.8% (95% CI -1, -0.6; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily. Lipid effects were generally neutral. No meaningful change in body weight was noted in any of the 6 treatment groups.

Patients were randomized (1:1), after a 2-week run-in period, to either linagliptin 5 mg plus metformin (1,500 to 2,000 mg per day, n=159) or linagliptin 5 mg plus placebo, (n=157) administered once daily. Patients in the linagliptin and metformin treatment group were up-titrated to a maximum tolerated dosage of metformin (1,000 to 2,000 mg per day) over a three-week period. Initial therapy with the combination of linagliptin and metformin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C compared to linagliptin (Table 8). The mean difference between groups in A1C change from baseline was -0.8% with 2-sided 95% confidence interval (-1.23%, -0.45%).

FPG: MMRM model included treatment, continuous baseline A1C, continuous baseline FPG, baseline FPG by visit interaction, visit by treatment interaction, baseline renal impairment by treatment interaction and baseline renal impairment by treatment by visit interaction. The adjusted mean changes for A1C (%) from baseline over time for linagliptin and metformin as compared to linagliptin alone were maintained throughout the 24 week treatment period. Using the completers analysis the respective adjusted means for A1C (%) changes from baseline for linagliptin and metformin as compared to linagliptin alone were -1.9 and -1.3 at week 6, -2.6 and -1.8 at week 12, -2.7 and -1.9 at week 18, and -2.7 and -1.9 at week 24. Changes in body weight from baseline were not clinically significant in either treatment group. Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin (n=491) at a dosage of at least 1,500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (n=207) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 6 weeks on metformin (at a dosage of at least 1,500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either linagliptin 5 mg or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glimepiride rescue. In combination with metformin, linagliptin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared with placebo (Table 9). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 7.8% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and in 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Active-Controlled Trial vs Glimepiride in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of linagliptin was evaluated in a 104-week, double-blind, glimepiride-controlled non-inferiority trial in type 2 diabetic patients with insufficient glycemic control despite metformin therapy. Patients being treated with metformin only entered a run-in period of 2 weeks\u2019 duration, whereas patients pretreated with metformin and one additional antihyperglycemic agent entered a run-in treatment period of 6 weeks\u2019 duration with metformin monotherapy (dosage of \u22651,500 mg per day) and washout of the other agent. After an additional 2-week placebo run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of linagliptin 5 mg once daily or glimepiride. Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs \u22658.5%), and the previous use of antidiabetic drugs (metformin alone vs metformin plus one other OAD). Patients receiving glimepiride were given an initial dosage of 1 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 12 weeks to a maximum dosage of 4 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glimepiride dosage was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. After 52 weeks and 104 weeks, linagliptin and glimepiride both had reductions from baseline in A1C (52 weeks: -0.4% for linagliptin, -0.6% for glimepiride; 104 weeks: -0.2% for linagliptin, -0.4% for glimepiride) from a baseline mean of 7.7% (Table 10). The mean difference between groups in A1C change from baseline was 0.2% with 2-sided 97.5% confidence interval (0.1%, 0.3%) for the intent-to-treat population using last observation carried forward. These results were consistent with the completers analysis.

FPG: ANCOVA model included treatment and number of prior OADs as class-effects, as well as baseline HbA1c and baseline FPG as continuous covariates. Patients treated with linagliptin had a mean baseline body weight of 86 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean decrease in body weight of 1.1 kg at 52 weeks and 1.4 kg at 104 weeks. Patients on glimepiride had a mean baseline body weight of 87 kg and were observed to have an adjusted mean increase from baseline in body weight of 1.4 kg at 52 weeks and 1.3 kg at 104 weeks (treatment difference p<0.0001 for both timepoints). Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin and a Sulfonylurea A total of 1,058 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of linagliptin in combination with a sulfonylurea and metformin. The most common sulfonylureas used by patients in the trial were glimepiride (31%), glibenclamide (26%), and gliclazide (26% [not available in the United States]). Patients on a sulfonylurea and metformin were randomized to receive linagliptin 5 mg or placebo, each administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the trial were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Glycemic end points measured included A1C and FPG. In combination with a sulfonylurea and metformin, linagliptin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared with placebo (Table 11). In the entire trial population (patients on linagliptin in combination with a sulfonylurea and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.6% and in FPG of -13 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 5.4% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and in 13% of patients treated with placebo. Change from baseline in body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.

The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between linagliptin and placebo when these were added to standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. The trial was event driven, the median duration of follow-up was 2.2 years and vital status was obtained for 99.7% of patients. Patients were eligible to enter the trial if they were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with HbA1c of 6.5% to 10%, and had either albuminuria and previous macrovascular disease (39% of enrolled population), or evidence of impaired renal function by eGFR and Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) criteria (42% of enrolled population), or both (18% of enrolled population). At baseline the mean age was 66 years and the population was 63% male, 80% White, 9% Asian, 6% Black or African American and 36% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean HbA1c was 8% and mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 15 years. The trial population included 17% patients \u226575 years of age and 62% patients with renal impairment defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The mean eGFR was 55 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 27% of patients had mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), 47% of patients had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and 15% of patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Patients were taking at least one antidiabetic drug (97%), and the most common were insulin and analogues (57%), metformin (54%) and sulfonylurea (32%). Patients were also taking antihypertensives (96%), lipid lowering drugs (76%) with 72% on statin, and aspirin (62%). The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of one of three composite outcomes which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. The results of CARMELINA, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 12. The estimated hazard ratio for MACE associated with linagliptin relative to placebo was 1.02 with a 95% confidence interval of (0.89, 1.17). The upper bound of this confidence interval, 1.17, excluded the risk margin of 1.3. The Kaplan-Meier curve depicting time to first occurrence of MACE is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier: Time to First Occurrence of MACE in the CARMELINA Trial CAROLINA The cardiovascular risk of linagliptin was evaluated in CAROLINA, a multi-center, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial comparing linagliptin (N=3,023) to glimepiride (N=3,010) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of established cardiovascular disease and/or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) between linagliptin and glimepiride when these were added to standard of care treatments for diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. The trial was event driven, the median duration of follow-up was 6.23 years and vital status was obtained for 99.3% of patients. Patients were eligible to enter the trial if they were adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient glycemic control (defined as HbA1c of 6.5% to 8.5% or 6.5% to 7.5% depending on whether treatment-na\u00efve, on monotherapy or on combination therapy), and were defined to be at high cardiovascular risk with previous vascular disease, evidence of vascular related end-organ damage, age \u226570 years, and/or two cardiovascular risk factors (duration of diabetes mellitus >10 years, systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg, current smoker, LDL cholesterol \u2265135 mg/dL). At baseline, the mean age was 64 years and the population was 60% male, 73% White, 18% Asian, 5% Black or African American, and 17% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean HbA1c was 7.15% and mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 7.6 years. The trial population included 34% patients \u226570 years of age and 19% patients with renal impairment defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . The mean eGFR was 77 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Patients were taking at least one antidiabetic drug (91%) and the most common were metformin (83%) and sulfonylurea (28%). Patients were also taking antihypertensives (89%), lipid lowering drugs (70%) with 65% on statin, and aspirin (47%). The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of one of three composite outcomes which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The trial was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the upper bound of the 95% CI for the hazard ratio of MACE. The results of CAROLINA, including the contribution of each component to the primary composite endpoint, are shown in Table 13.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue linagliptin. (5.1) Heart failure: Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of linagliptin in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor for signs and symptoms. (5.2) Hypoglycemia: When used with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea (SU)) or insulin, consider lowering the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia (5.3) Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions) have occurred with linagliptin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue linagliptin, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. (5.4) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. (5.5) Bullous pemphigoid: There have been reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue linagliptin (5.6) . 5.1 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, has been reported in patients treated with linagliptin. Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue linagliptin and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using linagliptin. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between DPP-4 inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of linagliptin prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of linagliptin. 5.3 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia Insulin secretagogues and insulin are known to cause hypoglycemia. The use of linagliptin in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia compared with placebo in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The use of linagliptin in combination with insulin in subjects with severe renal impairment was associated with a higher rate of hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Therefore, a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with linagliptin. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with linagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions predominantly occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with linagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue linagliptin, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with linagliptin. 5.5 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.6 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving linagliptin. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, linagliptin should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

The safety evaluation of linagliptin 5 mg once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes is based on 14 placebo-controlled trials, 1 active-controlled study, and one study in patients with severe renal impairment. In the 14 placebo-controlled studies, a total of 3625 patients were randomized and treated with linagliptin 5 mg daily and 2176 with placebo. The mean exposure in patients treated with linagliptin across studies was 29.6 weeks. The maximum follow-up was 78 weeks. Linagliptin 5 mg once daily was studied as monotherapy in three placebo-controlled trials of 18 and 24 weeks\u2019 duration and in five additional placebo-controlled studies lasting \u226418 weeks. The use of linagliptin in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents was studied in six placebo-controlled trials: two with metformin (12 and 24 weeks\u2019 treatment duration); one with a sulfonylurea (18 weeks\u2019 treatment duration); one with metformin and sulfonylurea (24 weeks\u2019 treatment duration); one with pioglitazone (24 weeks\u2019 treatment duration); and one with insulin (primary endpoint at 24 weeks). In a pooled dataset of 14 placebo-controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of patients receiving linagliptin (n = 3625) and more commonly than in patients given placebo (n = 2176), are shown in Table 1. The overall incidence of adverse events with linagliptin were similar to placebo. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients Treated with Linagliptin and Greater than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Linagliptin Monotherapy or Combination Therapy Number (%) of Patients Linagliptin 5 mg n = 3625 Placebo n = 2176 Nasopharyngitis 254 (7.0) 132 (6.1) Diarrhea 119 (3.3) 65 (3.0) Cough 76 (2.1) 30 (1.4) Rates for other adverse reactions for linagliptin 5 mg vs placebo when linagliptin was used in combination with specific anti-diabetic agents were: urinary tract infection (3.1% vs 0%) and hypertriglyceridemia (2.4% vs 0%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to sulfonylurea; hyperlipidemia (2.7% vs 0.8%) and weight increased (2.3% vs 0.8%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to pioglitazone; and constipation (2.1% vs 1%) when linagliptin was used as add-on to basal insulin therapy. Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies with treatment of linagliptin were hypersensitivity (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyperreactivity) and myalgia. Following 104 weeks\u2019 treatment in a controlled study comparing linagliptin with glimepiride in which all patients were also receiving metformin, adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with linagliptin (n = 776) and more frequently than in patients treated with a sulfonylurea (n = 775) were back pain (9.1% vs 8.4%), arthralgia (8.1% vs 6.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.0% vs 7.6%), headache (6.4% vs 5.2%), cough (6.1% vs 4.9%), and pain in extremity (5.3% vs 3.9%). In the clinical trial program, pancreatitis was reported in 15.2 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with linagliptin compared with 3.7 cases per 10,000 patient year exposure while being treated with comparator (placebo and active comparator, sulfonylurea). Three additional cases of pancreatitis were reported following the last administered dose of linagliptin. Hypoglycemia Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemia in placebo-controlled studies of linagliptin. The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when linagliptin was administered with sulfonylurea or insulin. Table 2: Incidence (%) of Hypoglycemia in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Linagliptin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus *Hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Add-on to Sulfonylurea (18 Weeks) Placebo (N=84) Linagliptin (N=161) Hypoglycemia with plasma glucose <54 mg/dL 1.2% 1.9% Severe* hypoglycemia (%) 0% 0% Add-on to Metformin and Sulfonylurea (24 Weeks) Placebo (N=263) Linagliptin (N=792) Hypoglycemia with plasma glucose <54 mg/dL 5.3% 8.1% Severe* hypoglycemia (%) 0.8% 0.6% Add-on to Basal Insulin (52 Weeks) Placebo (N=630) Linagliptin (N=631) Hypoglycemia with plasma glucose <54 mg/dL 21.6% 19.8% Severe* hypoglycemia (%) 1.1% 1.7% Use in Renal Impairment Linagliptin was compared to placebo as add-on to pre-existing antidiabetic therapy over 52 weeks in 133 patients with severe renal impairment (estimated GFR <30 mL/min). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and included insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy were allowed. In general, the incidence of adverse events including severe hypoglycemia was similar to those reported in other linagliptin trials. The observed incidence of hypoglycemia was higher (linagliptin, 63% compared to placebo, 49%) due to an increase in asymptomatic hypoglycemic events especially during the first 12 weeks when background glycemic therapies were kept stable. Ten linagliptin-treated patients (15%) and 11 placebo-treated patients (17%) reported at least one episode of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying finger stick glucose \u226454 mg/dL). During the same time period, severe hypoglycemic events, defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions, were reported in 3 (4.4%) linagliptin-treated patients and 3 (4.6%) placebo-treated patients. Events that were considered life-threatening or required hospitalization were reported in 2 (2.9%) patients on linagliptin and 1 (1.5%) patient on placebo. Renal function as measured by mean eGFR and creatinine clearance did not change over 52 weeks' treatment compared to placebo. Laboratory Tests Changes in laboratory findings were similar in patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. Increase in Uric Acid: Changes in laboratory values that occurred more frequently in the linagliptin group and > 1% more than in the placebo group were increases in uric acid (1.3% in the placebo group, 2.7% in the linagliptin group). Increase in Lipase: In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with linagliptin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria, a mean increase of 30% in lipase concentrations from baseline to 24 weeks was observed in the linagliptin arm compared to a mean decrease of 2% in the placebo arm. Lipase levels above 3 times upper limit of normal were seen in 8.2% compared to 1.7% patients in the linagliptin and placebo arms, respectively. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase with linagliptin is unknown in the absence of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Vital Signs No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were observed in patients treated with linagliptin. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of linagliptin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited data with linagliptin use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform of drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when linagliptin was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the maximum recommended clinical dose, based on exposure [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c>7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25% in women with HbA1c>10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data No adverse developmental outcome was observed when linagliptin was administered to pregnant Wistar Han rats and Himalayan rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 240 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg, respectively. These doses represent approximately 943 times (rats) and 1943 times (rabbits) the 5 mg clinical dose, based on exposure. No adverse functional, behavioral, or reproductive outcome was observed in offspring following administration of linagliptin to Wistar Han rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 at a dose 49 times the 5 mg clinical dose, based on exposure. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of linagliptin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. However, linagliptin is present in rat milk. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for linagliptin tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from linagliptin tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of linagliptin in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use In the 15 type 2 diabetes studies with linagliptin, 1085 linagliptin-treated patients were 65 years of age and older (including 131 linagliptin-treated patients 75 years of age and older).

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in better regulation of glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4, and selectively inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100-mg dose. At the 100-mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5-mg dose. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin has been characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration of a single 5-mg dose to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations of linagliptin occurred at approximately 1.5 hours post dose (T max ); the mean plasma area under the curve (AUC) was 139 nmol*h/L and maximum concentration (C max ) was 8.9 nmol/L. Plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in at least a biphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (>100 hours), related to the saturable binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. The prolonged elimination phase does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of linagliptin 5 mg, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin 5 mg are reached by the third dose, and C max and AUC increased by a factor of 1.3 at steady-state compared with the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small (12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin is similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. A high-fat meal reduced C max by 15% and increased AUC by 4%; this effect is not clinically relevant. Linagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single intravenous dose of linagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 L, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75%-89% at \u226530 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high concentrations, where DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70% to 80% of linagliptin remains bound to plasma proteins and 20% to 30% is unbound in plasma. Plasma binding is not altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Elimination Linagliptin has a terminal half-life of about 200 hours at steady-state, though the accumulation half-life is about 11 hours. Renal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min. Metabolism Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linagliptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linagliptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite, which shows a steady-state exposure of 13.3% relative to linagliptin. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]-linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated via the enterohepatic system (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Specific Populations Renal Impairment An open-label pharmacokinetic study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin 5 mg in male and female patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment. The study included 6 healthy subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] \u226580 mL/min), 6 patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to <80 mL/min), 6 patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), and 11 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In patients with moderate renal impairment under steady-state conditions, mean exposure of linagliptin increased (AUC \u03c4,ss by 71% and C max by 46%) compared with healthy subjects. This increase was not associated with a prolonged accumulation half-life, terminal half-life, or an increased accumulation factor. Renal excretion of linagliptin was below 5% of the administered dose and was not affected by decreased renal function. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than that of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUC \u03c4,ss by 42% and C max by 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitus groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose. These findings were further supported by the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), steady-state exposure (AUC \u03c4,ss ) of linagliptin was approximately 25% lower and C max,ss was approximately 36% lower than in healthy subjects. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), AUC ss of linagliptin was about 14% lower and C max,ss was approximately 8% lower than in healthy subjects. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) had comparable exposure of linagliptin in terms of AUC 0-24 and approximately 23% lower C max compared with healthy subjects. Reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters seen in patients with hepatic impairment did not result in reductions in DPP-4 inhibition. Body Mass Index (BMI)/Weight No dose adjustment is necessary based on BMI/weight. BMI/weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Geriatric Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Pediatric Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in pediatric patients have not yet been performed. Race No dose adjustment is necessary based on race. Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on available pharmacokinetic data, including subjects of White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian racial groups. Drug Interactions In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Linagliptin is a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes and is not an inducer of CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 4A11. Linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and inhibits P-gp mediated transport of digoxin at high concentrations. Based on these results and in vivo drug interaction studies, linagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates at therapeutic concentrations. In vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Strong inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp (e.g., rifampin) decrease exposure to linagliptin to subtherapeutic and likely ineffective concentrations [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In vivo studies indicated evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-gp and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha-cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus increases the concentrations of incretin hormones. Linagliptin glucose dependently increases insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, thus resulting in better regulation of glucose homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4, and selectively inhibits DPP-4 but not DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled, active-comparator, 4-way crossover study, 36 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of linagliptin 5 mg, linagliptin 100 mg (20 times the recommended dose), moxifloxacin, and placebo. No increase in QTc was observed with either the recommended dose of 5 mg or the 100-mg dose. At the 100-mg dose, peak linagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 38-fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 5-mg dose."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin has been characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration of a single 5-mg dose to healthy subjects, peak plasma concentrations of linagliptin occurred at approximately 1.5 hours post dose (T max ); the mean plasma area under the curve (AUC) was 139 nmol*h/L and maximum concentration (C max ) was 8.9 nmol/L. Plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in at least a biphasic manner with a long terminal half-life (>100 hours), related to the saturable binding of linagliptin to DPP-4. The prolonged elimination phase does not contribute to the accumulation of the drug. The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of multiple doses of linagliptin 5 mg, is approximately 12 hours. After once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin 5 mg are reached by the third dose, and C max and AUC increased by a factor of 1.3 at steady-state compared with the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small (12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Plasma AUC of linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin is similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. A high-fat meal reduced C max by 15% and increased AUC by 4%; this effect is not clinically relevant. Linagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state following a single intravenous dose of linagliptin 5 mg to healthy subjects is approximately 1110 L, indicating that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75%-89% at \u226530 nmol/L, reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high concentrations, where DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70% to 80% of linagliptin remains bound to plasma proteins and 20% to 30% is unbound in plasma. Plasma binding is not altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Elimination Linagliptin has a terminal half-life of about 200 hours at steady-state, though the accumulation half-life is about 11 hours. Renal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min. Metabolism Following oral administration, the majority (about 90%) of linagliptin is excreted unchanged, indicating that metabolism represents a minor elimination pathway. A small fraction of absorbed linagliptin is metabolized to a pharmacologically inactive metabolite, which shows a steady-state exposure of 13.3% relative to linagliptin. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]-linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated via the enterohepatic system (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. Specific Populations Renal Impairment An open-label pharmacokinetic study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin 5 mg in male and female patients with varying degrees of chronic renal impairment. The study included 6 healthy subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance [CrCl] \u226580 mL/min), 6 patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to <80 mL/min), 6 patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to <50 mL/min), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), and 11 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was comparable to healthy subjects. In patients with moderate renal impairment under steady-state conditions, mean exposure of linagliptin increased (AUC \u03c4,ss by 71% and C max by 46%) compared with healthy subjects. This increase was not associated with a prolonged accumulation half-life, terminal half-life, or an increased accumulation factor. Renal excretion of linagliptin was below 5% of the administered dose and was not affected by decreased renal function. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and severe renal impairment showed steady-state exposure approximately 40% higher than that of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function (increase in AUC \u03c4,ss by 42% and C max by 35%). For both type 2 diabetes mellitus groups, renal excretion was below 7% of the administered dose. These findings were further supported by the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses. Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), steady-state exposure (AUC \u03c4,ss ) of linagliptin was approximately 25% lower and C max,ss was approximately 36% lower than in healthy subjects. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), AUC ss of linagliptin was about 14% lower and C max,ss was approximately 8% lower than in healthy subjects. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) had comparable exposure of linagliptin in terms of AUC 0-24 and approximately 23% lower C max compared with healthy subjects. Reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters seen in patients with hepatic impairment did not result in reductions in DPP-4 inhibition. Body Mass Index (BMI)/Weight No dose adjustment is necessary based on BMI/weight. BMI/weight had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gender No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Geriatric Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Pediatric Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in pediatric patients have not yet been performed. Race No dose adjustment is necessary based on race. Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on available pharmacokinetic data, including subjects of White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian racial groups. Drug Interactions In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Linagliptin is a weak to moderate inhibitor of CYP isozyme CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes and is not an inducer of CYP isozymes, including CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 4A11. Linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and inhibits P-gp mediated transport of digoxin at high concentrations.

The highest dose of 60 mg/kg is approximately 418 times the clinical dose of 5 mg/day based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice in a 2-year study at doses up to 80 mg/kg (males) and 25 mg/kg (females), or approximately 35 and 270 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure. Higher doses of linagliptin in female mice (80 mg/kg) increased the incidence of lymphoma at approximately 215 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure. Linagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In fertility studies in rats, linagliptin had no adverse effects on early embryonic development, mating, fertility, or bearing live young up to the highest dose of 240 mg/kg (approximately 943 times the clinical dose based on AUC exposure)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials Linagliptin has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, and insulin. Linagliptin has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe chronic renal impairment. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with linagliptin produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared with placebo. Monotherapy A total of 730 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18 weeks\u2019 and another of 24 weeks\u2019 duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 6 weeks that included an open-label placebo run-in during the last 2 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, only patients ineligible for metformin were recruited. In the 18-week study, 76 patients were randomized to placebo and 151 to linagliptin 5 mg; in the 24-week study, 167 patients were randomized to placebo and 336 to linagliptin 5 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the 18-week study received rescue therapy with pioglitazone and/or insulin; metformin rescue therapy was used in the 24-week trial. Treatment with linagliptin 5 mg daily provided statistically significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared with placebo (Table 5). In the 18-week study, 12% of patients receiving linagliptin 5 mg and 18% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 10.2% of patients receiving linagliptin 5 mg and 20.9% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared with placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, baseline BMI, or a standard index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with linagliptin appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, the changes from baseline in A1C were -0.4% and -0.4%, respectively, for those given linagliptin, and 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, for those given placebo. Change from baseline in body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.

Patients already on metformin (n = 491) at a dose of at least 1,500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (n = 207) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 6 weeks on metformin (at a dose of at least 1,500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either linagliptin 5 mg or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glimepiride rescue. In combination with metformin, linagliptin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared with placebo (Table 6). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 7.8% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and in 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (52%) underwent a drug washout period of 4 weeks\u2019 duration. After the washout period and after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657.0% to \u226410.5%) were randomized. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C \u22657.5% to <11.0%) not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (48%) immediately entered the 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Randomization was stratified by baseline A1C (<8.5% vs \u22658.5%) and use of a prior oral antidiabetic drug (none vs monotherapy). Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2:2 ratio to either placebo or one of 5 active-treatment arms. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 5 mg of linagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1,000 mg of metformin twice daily, or 2.5 mg of linagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1,000 mg of metformin twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, or insulin rescue therapy. Initial therapy with the combination of linagliptin and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to linagliptin alone (Table 7). The adjusted mean treatment difference in A1C from baseline to week 24 (LOCF) was -0.5% (95% CI -0.7, -0.3; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg twice daily compared to metformin 1,000 twice daily; -1.1% (95% CI -1.4, -0.9; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 1,000 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily; -0.6% (95% CI -0.8, -0.4; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to metformin 500 mg twice daily; and -0.8% (95% CI -1.0, -0.6; p<0.0001) for linagliptin 2.5 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily compared to linagliptin 5 mg once daily. Lipid effects were generally neutral. No meaningful change in body weight was noted in any of the 6 treatment groups.

Patients being treated with metformin only entered a run-in period of 2 weeks\u2019 duration, whereas patients pretreated with metformin and one additional antihyperglycemic agent entered a run-in treatment period of 6 weeks\u2019 duration with metformin monotherapy (dose of \u22651,500 mg/day) and washout of the other agent. After an additional 2-week placebo run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of linagliptin 5 mg once daily or glimepiride. Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs \u22658.5%), and the previous use of antidiabetic drugs (metformin alone vs metformin plus one other OAD). Patients receiving glimepiride were given an initial dose of 1 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 12 weeks to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glimepiride dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. After 52 and 104 weeks, linagliptin and glimepiride both had reductions from baseline in A1C (52 weeks: -0.4% for linagliptin, -0.6% for glimepiride; 104 weeks: -0.2% for linagliptin, -0.4% for glimepiride) from a baseline mean of 7.7% (Table 8). The mean difference between groups in A1C change from baseline was 0.2% with 2-sided 97.5% confidence interval (0.1%, 0.3%) for the intent-to-treat population using last observation carried forward. These results were consistent with the completers analysis.

Drug-na\u00efve patients entered directly into the 2-week placebo run-in period. After the run-in period, patients were randomized to receive either linagliptin 5 mg or placebo, both in addition to pioglitazone 30 mg daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and FPG. In initial combination with pioglitazone 30 mg, linagliptin 5 mg provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 9). Rescue therapy was used in 7.9% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg/pioglitazone 30 mg and 14.1% of patients treated with placebo/pioglitazone 30 mg. Patient weight increased in both groups during the study with an adjusted mean change from baseline of 2.3 kg and 1.2 kg in the linagliptin 5 mg/pioglitazone 30 mg and placebo/pioglitazone 30 mg groups, respectively (p = 0.0141).

Patients on sulfonylurea monotherapy (n = 142) were randomized after completing a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Patients on a sulfonylurea plus one additional oral antihyperglycemic agent (n = 103) were randomized after a wash-out period of 4 weeks and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period. Patients were randomized to the addition of linagliptin 5 mg or to placebo, each administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured included A1C and FPG. In combination with a sulfonylurea, linagliptin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C compared with placebo following 18 weeks\u2019 treatment; the improvements in FPG observed with linagliptin were not statistically significant compared with placebo (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7.6% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and 15.9% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between linagliptin and placebo in body weight.

The most common sulfonylureas used by patients in the study were: glimepiride (31%), glibenclamide (26%), and gliclazide (26%, not available in the United States). Patients on a sulfonylurea and metformin were randomized to receive linagliptin 5 mg or placebo, each administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured included A1C and FPG. In combination with a sulfonylurea and metformin, linagliptin provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared with placebo (Table 11). In the entire study population (patients on linagliptin in combination with sulfonylurea and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.6% and in FPG of -13 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 5.4% of patients treated with linagliptin 5 mg and in 13% of patients treated with placebo. Change from baseline in body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.

Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs \u22658.5%), renal function impairment status (based on baseline eGFR), and concomitant use of oral antidiabetic drugs (none, metformin only, pioglitazone only, metformin + pioglitazone). Patients with a baseline A1C of > 7% and < 10% were included in the study including 709 patients with renal impairment (eGFR <90 mL/min), most of whom (n=575) were categorized as mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to <90 mL/min). Patients entered a 2 week placebo run-in period on basal insulin (e.g., insulin glargine, insulin detemir, or NPH insulin) with or without metformin and/or pioglitazone background therapy. Following the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control were randomized to the addition of either 5 mg of linagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were maintained on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment, during the run-in period, and during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were rescued by increasing background insulin dose. Linagliptin used in combination with insulin (with or without metformin and/or pioglitazone), provided statistically significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 12) after 24 weeks of treatment. The mean total daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units for patients treated with linagliptin and 40 units for patients treated with placebo. Background baseline diabetes therapy included use of: insulin alone (16.1%), insulin combined with metformin only (75.5%), insulin combined with metformin and pioglitazone (7.4%), and insulin combined with pioglitazone only (1%). The mean change from baseline to Week 24 in the daily dose of insulin was +1.3 IU in the placebo group and +0.6 IU in the linagliptin group. The mean change in body weight from baseline to Week 24 was similar in the two treatment groups.

Renal Impairment A total of 133 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 52 week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in patients with both type 2 diabetes and severe chronic renal impairment. Participants with an estimated (based on the four variables modified diet in renal disease [MDRD] equation) GFR value of <30 mL/min were eligible to participate in the study. Randomization was stratified by baseline HbA1c (\u22648% and >8%) and background antidiabetic therapy (insulin or any combination with insulin, SU or glinides as monotherapy and pioglitazone or any other antidiabetics excluding any other DPP-4 inhibitors). For the initial 12 weeks of the study, background antidiabetic therapy was kept stable and included insulin, sulfonylurea, glinides, and pioglitazone. For the remainder of the trial, dose adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy were allowed. At baseline in this trial, 62.5% of patients were receiving insulin alone as background diabetes therapy, and 12.5% were receiving sulfonylurea alone. After 12 weeks of treatment, linagliptin 5 mg provided statistically significant improvement in A1C compared to placebo, with an adjusted mean change of -0.6% compared to placebo (95% confidence interval -0.9, -0.3) based on the analysis using last observation carried forward (LOCF). With adjustments in antidiabetic background therapy after the initial 12 weeks, efficacy was maintained for 52 weeks, with an adjusted mean change from baseline in A1C of -0.7% compared to placebo (95% confidence interval -1.0, -0.4) based on analysis using LOCF."

Pancreatitis Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during use of linagliptin. Inform patients that persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to discontinue linagliptin promptly and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].
