      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Although rare case reports of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, untreated NAGS deficiency can result in irreversible neurologic damage and death in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations) . In an animal reproduction study, decreased survival and growth occurred in offspring born to rats that received carglumic acid at a dose approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, miscarriage, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Pregnant women with urea cycle disorders may experience an increase in catabolic stress which can trigger a hyperammonemic crisis both in the intrapartum and in the post-partum (3 - 14 days post-partum) periods. Maternal complications related to hyperammonemic crisis can include neurological impairment, coma and in some cases death. Data Animal Data No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats treated with up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC [area under the plasma concentration-time curve]) from two weeks prior to mating through organogenesis or in pregnant rabbits treated with up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC) during organogenesis. In a pre- and post-natal developmental study, female rats received oral carglumic acid from organogenesis through lactation at doses of 500 mg/kg/day and 2000 mg/kg/day. Decreased growth of offspring was observed at 500 mg/kg/day and higher (approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC), and reduction in offspring survival during lactation was observed at 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC). No effects on physical and sexual development, learning and memory, or reproductive performance were observed through maturation of the surviving offspring at maternal doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. The high dose (2000 mg/kg/day) produced maternal toxicity (impaired weight gain and approximately 10% mortality). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether carglumic acid is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of carglumic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Carglumic acid is present in milk from treated rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension for the treatment of pediatric patients (birth to 17 years of age) with acute or chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency have been established, and the information on these uses are discussed throughout the labeling. There are insufficient data to determine if there is a difference in clinical or biochemical responses between adult and pediatric patients treated with Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension did not include patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Plasma concentrations of carglumic acid increased in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Reduce the carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid have not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) which is produced from glutamate and acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), a mitochondrial liver enzyme. NAG acts as the essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1), a mitochondrial liver enzyme which catalyzes the first reaction of the urea cycle. The urea cycle, whose role is the disposition of ammonia, includes a series of biochemical reactions in the liver resulting in the conversion of ammonia into urea, which is then excreted through the urine. Carglumic acid acts as a CPS1 activator, improves or restores the function of the urea cycle, and facilitates ammonia detoxification and urea production. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency, carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies. No dose-response relationship has been identified. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of carglumic acid was evaluated in a Phase 1, randomized study in 76 healthy volunteers. The study suggests a lack of clinically relevant QT prolongation effect at the highest therapeutic dose level (250 mg/kg/day). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in healthy subjects following an intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours at 8 mg/kg or an oral administration at 100 mg/kg are summarized in Table 3 . Table 3: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values of Carglumic Acid in Healthy Subjects # Median (range); N/A, not applicable PK parameter IV infusion 8 mg/kg (N=10) Oral 100 mg/kg (N=12) C max (ng/mL) 8613 (558) 3284 (321) T max (hr) # 2 (1-2) 3 (2-4) AUC (ng*hr/mL) 24501 (1613) 31426 (2150) T 1/2 (hr) 31 (3) 25 (2) CL (L/hr/kg) 0.34 (0.02) N/A Vd (L/kg) 15 (1) N/A Absorption Following an oral administration of Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension 100 mg/kg in healthy subjects, the absolute bioavailability was approximately 10%. Distribution Carglumic acid is not bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Carglumic acid is predominantly excreted by the kidneys as unchanged product. Metabolism A proportion of carglumic acid may be metabolized by the intestinal bacterial flora. The likely end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, eliminated through the lungs. Excretion Following an oral administration of radiolabeled carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension at 100 mg/kg, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and up to 60% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the feces. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg. The C max and AUC 0-t of carglumic acid are summarized in Table 4 . The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of C max in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1.3 (0.95, 1.86), 2.0 (1.62, 2.50), and 4.4 (3.11, 6.28) respectively.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) which is produced from glutamate and acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), a mitochondrial liver enzyme. NAG acts as the essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1), a mitochondrial liver enzyme which catalyzes the first reaction of the urea cycle. The urea cycle, whose role is the disposition of ammonia, includes a series of biochemical reactions in the liver resulting in the conversion of ammonia into urea, which is then excreted through the urine. Carglumic acid acts as a CPS1 activator, improves or restores the function of the urea cycle, and facilitates ammonia detoxification and urea production."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency, carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies. No dose-response relationship has been identified. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of carglumic acid was evaluated in a Phase 1, randomized study in 76 healthy volunteers. The study suggests a lack of clinically relevant QT prolongation effect at the highest therapeutic dose level (250 mg/kg/day)."

Distribution Carglumic acid is not bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Carglumic acid is predominantly excreted by the kidneys as unchanged product. Metabolism A proportion of carglumic acid may be metabolized by the intestinal bacterial flora. The likely end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, eliminated through the lungs. Excretion Following an oral administration of radiolabeled carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension at 100 mg/kg, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and up to 60% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the feces. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg. The C max and AUC 0-t of carglumic acid are summarized in Table 4 . The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of C max in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1.3 (0.95, 1.86), 2.0 (1.62, 2.50), and 4.4 (3.11, 6.28) respectively.

For acute treatment, patients received Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension at 100 mg/kg/day to 250 mg/kg/day orally administered in 2 to 4 divided doses. For maintenance treatment, the dosage was reduced over time based on plasma ammonia level and clinical response. The baseline characteristics of the patient population are shown in Table 5. Table 5: Baseline Characteristics of 23 NAGS Deficiency Patients Treated with Carglumic Acid Tablets for Oral Suspension Patients N=23 Sex Male 14 (61%) Female 9 (39%) Age at initiation of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension therapy (years) Mean (SD) 2 (4) Min - Max 0 - 13 Age groups at initiation of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension therapy <30 days 9 (39%) >30 days - 11 months 9 (39%) \u22651 - 13 years 5 (22%) NAGS gene mutations by DNA testing Homozygous 14 (61%) Heterozygous 4 (17%) Not available 5 (22%) Patients current treatment status On-going 18 (78%) Discontinued 5 (22%) The clinical and biochemical data in the 23-patient case series were retrospectively collected, unblinded, and uncontrolled and preclude formal statistical testing. Short-term efficacy was evaluated using mean and median change in plasma ammonia levels from baseline to days 1 to 3. Persistence of the effect was evaluated using long-term mean and median change in plasma ammonia level. Of the 23 NAGS deficiency patients in the case series, 13 patients had documented plasma ammonia levels prior to carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension treatment and after long-term treatment with carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension and were evaluable. Table 6 summarizes the plasma ammonia levels at baseline, days 1 to 3 post-carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension treatment, and long-term carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension treatment (mean 8 years) in the 13 evaluable patients. All 13 patients had increased plasma ammonia levels at baseline (mean 271 micromol/L; normal range: 5 to 50 micromol/L). By day 3 and with long-term treatment, normal plasma ammonia levels were attained (Table 6).

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Although rare case reports of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, untreated NAGS deficiency can result in irreversible neurologic damage and death in pregnant women (see Clinical Considerations ). In an animal reproduction study, decreased survival and growth occurred in offspring born to rats that received carglumic acid at a dose approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, miscarriage, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Pregnant women with urea cycle disorders may experience an increase in catabolic stress which can trigger a hyperammonemic crisis both in the intrapartum and in the post-partum (3 - 14 days post-partum) periods. Maternal complications related to hyperammonemic crisis can include neurological impairment, coma and in some cases death. Data Animal Data No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats treated with up to 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC [area under the plasma concentration-time curve]) from two weeks prior to mating through organogenesis or in pregnant rabbits treated with up to 1000 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC) during organogenesis. In a pre- and post-natal developmental study, female rats received oral carglumic acid from organogenesis through lactation at doses of 500 mg/kg/day and 2000 mg/kg/day. Decreased growth of offspring was observed at 500 mg/kg/day and higher (approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC), and reduction in offspring survival during lactation was observed at 2000 mg/kg/day (approximately 38 times the maximum reported human maintenance dose [100 mg/kg/day] based on AUC). No effects on physical and sexual development, learning and memory, or reproductive performance were observed through maturation of the surviving offspring at maternal doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day. The high dose (2000 mg/kg/day) produced maternal toxicity (impaired weight gain and approximately 10% mortality). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether carglumic acid is present in human milk. There are no available data on the effects of carglumic acid on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Carglumic acid is present in milk from treated rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension for the treatment of pediatric patients (birth to 17 years of age) with acute or chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency have been established, and the information on these uses are discussed throughout the labeling. There are insufficient data to determine if there is a difference in clinical or biochemical responses between adult and pediatric patients treated with Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension did not include patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Plasma concentrations of carglumic acid increased in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Reduce the carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension dosage in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid have not been evaluated in patients with end stage renal disease."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) which is produced from glutamate and acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), a mitochondrial liver enzyme. NAG acts as an essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1), a mitochondrial liver enzyme which catalyzes the first reaction of the urea cycle. The urea cycle, whose role is the disposition of ammonia, includes a series of biochemical reactions in the liver resulting in the conversion of ammonia into urea, which is then excreted through the urine. Carglumic acid acts as a CPS1 activator, improves or restores the function of the urea cycle, and facilitates ammonia detoxification and urea production. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency, carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies. No dose-response relationship has been identified. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of carglumic acid was evaluated in a Phase 1, randomized study in 76 healthy volunteers. The study suggests a lack of clinically relevant QT prolongation effect at the highest therapeutic dose level (250 mg/kg/day). 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in healthy subjects following an intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours at 8 mg/kg or an oral administration at 100 mg/kg are summarized in Table 3 . Table 3: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values of Carglumic Acid in Healthy Subjects # Median (range); N/A, not applicable.

Distribution Carglumic acid is not bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Carglumic acid is predominantly excreted by the kidneys as unchanged product. Metabolism A proportion of carglumic acid may be metabolized by the intestinal bacterial flora. The likely end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, eliminated through the lungs. Excretion Following an oral administration of radiolabeled carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension at 100 mg/kg, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and up to 60% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the feces. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg. The C max and AUC 0-t of carglumic acid are summarized in Table 4 . The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of C max in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1.3 (0.95, 1.86), 2.0 (1.62, 2.50), and 4.4 (3.11, 6.28) respectively. The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC 0-t in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1.4 (1.09, 1.73), 2.8 (2.27, 3.47), and 6.9 (5.21, 9.24), respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Table 4: Mean (SD) C max and AUC 0- t of Carglumic Acid Following Single Oral Dose Administration of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension 80 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg in Subjects with Renal Impairment and Matched Healthy Control Subjects with Normal Renal Function Treatment groups 1a and 1b represent two separate matched control groups of healthy subjects with normal renal function.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Carglumic acid is a synthetic structural analogue of N-acetylglutamate (NAG) which is produced from glutamate and acetyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), a mitochondrial liver enzyme. NAG acts as an essential allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1), a mitochondrial liver enzyme which catalyzes the first reaction of the urea cycle. The urea cycle, whose role is the disposition of ammonia, includes a series of biochemical reactions in the liver resulting in the conversion of ammonia into urea, which is then excreted through the urine. Carglumic acid acts as a CPS1 activator, improves or restores the function of the urea cycle, and facilitates ammonia detoxification and urea production."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a retrospective review of the clinical course in 23 patients with NAGS deficiency, carglumic acid reduced plasma ammonia levels within 24 hours when administered with and without concomitant ammonia lowering therapies. No dose-response relationship has been identified. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of carglumic acid was evaluated in a Phase 1, randomized study in 76 healthy volunteers. The study suggests a lack of clinically relevant QT prolongation effect at the highest therapeutic dose level (250 mg/kg/day)."

Distribution Carglumic acid is not bound to plasma proteins. Elimination Carglumic acid is predominantly excreted by the kidneys as unchanged product. Metabolism A proportion of carglumic acid may be metabolized by the intestinal bacterial flora. The likely end product of carglumic acid metabolism is carbon dioxide, eliminated through the lungs. Excretion Following an oral administration of radiolabeled carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension at 100 mg/kg, 9% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and up to 60% of the dose is recovered unchanged in the feces. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of carglumic acid in subjects with renal impairment were compared with healthy subjects with normal renal function following oral administration of a single dose of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension 40 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg. The C max and AUC 0-t of carglumic acid are summarized in Table 4 . The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of C max in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1.3 (0.95, 1.86), 2.0 (1.62, 2.50), and 4.4 (3.11, 6.28) respectively. The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of AUC 0-t in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment relative to those in their matched control subjects with normal renal function were approximately 1.4 (1.09, 1.73), 2.8 (2.27, 3.47), and 6.9 (5.21, 9.24), respectively [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] .

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Acute and Chronic Hyperammonemia due to NAGS Deficiency The efficacy of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension in the treatment of acute and chronic hyperammonemia due to NAGS deficiency was evaluated in a retrospective case series of 23 NAGS deficiency patients treated with Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension over a median duration of 7.9 years (range 0.6 to 20.8 years). For acute treatment, patients received Carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension at 100 mg/kg/day to 250 mg/kg/day orally administered in 2 to 4 divided doses. For maintenance treatment, the dosage was reduced over time based on plasma ammonia level and clinical responses. The baseline characteristics of the patient population are shown in Table 5. Table 5: Baseline Characteristics of 23 NAGS Deficiency Patients Treated with Carglumic Acid Tablets for Oral Suspension Patients N=23 Sex Male 14 (61%) Female 9 (39%) Age at initiation of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension therapy (years) Mean (SD) 2 (4) Min to Max 0 - 13 Age groups at initiation of carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension therapy <30 days 9 (39%) >30 days - 11 months 9 (39%) \u22651 - 13 years 5 (22%) NAGS gene mutations by DNA testing Homozygous 14 (61%) Heterozygous 4 (17%) Not available 5 (22%) Patients current treatment status On-going 18 (78%) Discontinued 5 (22%) The clinical and biochemical data in the 23-patient case series were retrospectively collected, unblinded, and uncontrolled and preclude formal statistical testing. Short-term efficacy was evaluated using mean and median change in plasma ammonia levels from baseline to days 1 to 3. Persistence of the effect was evaluated using long-term mean and median change in plasma ammonia level. Of the 23 NAGS deficiency patients in the case series, 13 patients had documented plasma ammonia levels prior to carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension treatment and after long-term treatment with carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension and were evaluable. Table 6 summarizes the plasma ammonia levels at baseline, days 1 to 3 post- carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension treatment, and long-term carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension treatment (mean 8 years) in the 13 evaluable patients. All 13 patients had increased plasma ammonia levels at baseline (mean 271 micromol/L; normal range: 5 to 50 micromol/L). By day 3 and with long-term treatment, normal plasma ammonia levels were attained (Table 6).
