    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Carbachol is a potent cholinergic (parasympathomimetic) agent which produces constriction of the iris and ciliary body resulting in reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). The exact mechanism by which carbachol lowers IOP is not precisely known."

Systemic: Side effects such as flushing, sweating, epigastric distress, abdominal cramps, tightness in urinary bladder, and headache have been reported with topical or systemic application of carbachol. The following additional reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MIOSTAT (carbachol intraocular solution, USP) 0.01% in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to MIOSTAT, or a combination of these factors, include: corneal edema, drug effect prolonged (miosis), eye inflammation, eye pain, intraocular pressure increased, ocular hyperemia, vision blurred, visual impairment, and vomiting."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Aseptically remove the sterile vial from the blister package by peeling the backing paper and dropping the vial onto a sterile tray. Withdraw the contents into a dry sterile syringe, and replace the needle with an atraumatic cannula prior to intraocular instillation. No more than one-half milliliter should be gently instilled into the anterior chamber for the production of satisfactory miosis. It may be instilled before or after securing sutures. Miosis is usually maximal within two to five minutes after application."
