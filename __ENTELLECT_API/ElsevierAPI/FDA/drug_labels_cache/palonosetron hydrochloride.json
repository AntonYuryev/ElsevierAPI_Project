      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Palonosetron hydrochloride injection is indicated in adults for prevention of: acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC). acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC). postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for up to 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy beyond 24 hours has not been demonstrated. As with other antiemetics, routine prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In patients where nausea and vomiting must be avoided during the postoperative period, palonosetron hydrochloride injection is recommended even where the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting is low. Palonosetron hydrochloride injection is indicated in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age for prevention of: acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a serotonin-3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist indicated in: Adults for prevention of: acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC).

If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) Serotonin syndrome: reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post- anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron hydrochloride injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious or otherwise clinically significant adverse reactions reported in other sections of labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most common adverse reactions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults (greater than or equal to 5%) are: headache and constipation ( 6.1 ) postoperative nausea and vomiting (greater than or equal to 2%) are: QT prolongation, bradycardia, headache, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avenacy Inc. at 1-855-283-6229 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Adverse Reaction Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg intravenously (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N=194) Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: Cardiovascular: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood Urinary System: urinary retention Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron hydrochloride injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: infusion site pain. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] are shown in Table 3 . Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron hydrochloride injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .

The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. Dermatological: pruritus Gastrointestinal System: flatulence, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia General: chills Liver: increases in AST and/or ALT, hepatic enzyme increased Metabolic: hypokalemia, anorexia Nervous System: dizziness Respiratory: hypoventilation, laryngospasm Urinary System: urinary retention 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of palonosetron HCl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: including dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Injection site reactions: including burning, induration, discomfort and pain"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron HCl use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron HCl during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for palonosetron hydrochloride injection and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults."

Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for palonosetron overdose. A single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 30 mg/kg (947 and 474 times the human dose for rats and mice, respectively, based on body surface area) was lethal to rats and mice. The major signs of toxicity were convulsions, gasping, pallor, cyanosis and collapse."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Palonosetron hydrochloride injection contains palonosetron as palonosetron HCl, an antiemetic and antinauseant agent. It is a serotonin-3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor. Chemically, palonosetron hydrochloride is: (3a S )-2-[( S )-1-Azabicyclo [2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo-1 H benz[ de ]isoquinoline hydrochloride. The empirical formula is C 19 H 24 N 2 O.HCl, with a molecular weight of 332.87. Palonosetron hydrochloride exists as a single isomer and has the following structural formula: Palonosetron hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water, soluble in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol and 2-propanol. Palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a sterile, clear, colorless, non-pyrogenic, isotonic, buffered solution for intravenous administration. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is available as a 5 mL single-dose vial. Each 5 mL vial contains: 0.25 mg palonosetron (equivalent to 0.28 mg palonosetron HCl), 207.5 mg mannitol, disodium edetate and citrate buffer in water for intravenous administration. The pH of the solution in the 5 mL vial is 4.5 to 5.5. Figure"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron HCl at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC= 29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron HCl at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with either a single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin less than or equal to 50 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide less than 1500 mg/m\u00b2, doxorubicin greater than 25 mg/m\u00b2, epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate greater than 250 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to less than 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin greater than or equal to 70 mg/m\u00b2 or cyclophosphamide greater than 1100 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 60 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide greater than 1500 mg/m\u00b2, and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [ Table 5 ]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [ Table 6 ] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [ Table 7 ].

The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (less than 1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8 , intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24-hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 Hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates a To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin.

All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9 . Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates a To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p less than 0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection vs Placebo \u0394 p-value a Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron hydrochloride injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron hydrochloride injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock : reported in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

( 6.1 ) \u2022 postoperative nausea and vomiting (\u2265 2%) are: QT prolongation, bradycardia, headache, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) Adverse Reaction Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.25 mg intravenously (N = 633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N = 410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N = 194) Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: \u2022 Cardiovascular: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation \u2022 Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash \u2022 Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia \u2022 Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence \u2022 General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome \u2022 Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy \u2022 Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia \u2022 Musculoskeletal: arthralgia \u2022 Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia \u2022 Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood \u2022 Urinary System: urinary retention \u2022 Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron hydrochloride injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: \u2022 Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia \u2022 General: infusion site pain \u2022 Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] are shown in Table 3. Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron hydrochloride injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group in Trials of Adults with Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Adverse Reaction Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.075 mg intravenously (N = 336) Placebo (N = 369) Electrocardiogram QT prolongation 5% 3% Bradycardia 4% 4% Headache 3% 4% Constipation 2% 3% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% of less of patients, in these PONV clinical trials were: \u2022 Cardiovascular: QTc prolongation, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, blood pressure decreased, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, generalized edema, ECG T wave amplitude decreased, platelet count decreased. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. \u2022 Dermatological: pruritus \u2022 Gastrointestinal System: flatulence, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia \u2022 General: chills \u2022 Liver: increases in AST and/or ALT, hepatic enzyme increased \u2022 Metabolic: hypokalemia, anorexia \u2022 Nervous System: dizziness \u2022 Respiratory: hypoventilation, laryngospasm \u2022 Urinary System: urinary retention 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of palonosetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: including dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Injection site reactions: including burning, induration, discomfort and pain"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron hydrochloride use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron hydrochloride during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron hydrochloride at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron hydrochloride and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1 SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 \u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron hydrochloride at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC = 29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron hydrochloride at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with either a single dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin > 25 mg/m 2 , epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m 2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [Table 5]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [Table 6] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [Table 7].

The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (< 1500 mg/m2), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8, intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24-hour time interval.

All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the U.S. in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: \u2022 Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours \u2022 Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea \u2022 Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in Table 9. Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection vs. Placebo \u0394 p-value To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p < 0.017. Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron hydrochloride injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron hydrochloride injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p = 0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p = 0.009."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock: reported in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation, at 1-877-725-2747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) Adverse Reaction Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg intravenously (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N=194) Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: \u2022 Cardiovascular: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation. \u2022 Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash \u2022 Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia \u2022 Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence \u2022 General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome \u2022 Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy \u2022 Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia \u2022 Musculoskeletal: arthralgia \u2022 Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia \u2022 Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood \u2022 Urinary System: urinary retention \u2022 Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron hydrochloride injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: \u2022 Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. \u2022 General: infusion site pain. \u2022 Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] are shown in Table 3. Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron hydrochloride injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ]. Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions* in Trials of Adults with Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Adverse Reaction Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously (N=336) Placebo (N=369) Electrocardiogram QT prolongation 5% 3% Bradycardia 4% 4% Headache 3% 4% Constipation 2% 3% * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% of less of patients, in these PONV clinical trials were: \u2022 Cardiovascular: QTc prolongation, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, blood pressure decreased, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, generalized edema, ECG T wave amplitude decreased, platelet count decreased. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. \u2022 Dermatological: pruritus \u2022 Gastrointestinal System: flatulence, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia \u2022 General: chills \u2022 Liver: increases in AST and/or ALT, hepatic enzyme increased \u2022 Metabolic: hypokalemia, anorexia \u2022 Nervous System: dizziness \u2022 Respiratory: hypoventilation, laryngospasm \u2022 Urinary System: urinary retention 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of palonosetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: including dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Injection site reactions: including burning, induration, discomfort and pain"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron hydrochloride use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron hydrochloride during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron hydrochloride at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron hydrochloride and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 ) ]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Palonosetron hydrochloride injection contains palonosetron as palonosetron hydrochloride, an antiemetic and antinauseant agent. It is a serotonin-3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor. Chemically, palonosetron hydrochloride is: (3aS)-2\u2011[(S)-1-Azabicyclo [2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-2,3,3a,4,5,6-hexahydro-1-oxo\u20111Hbenz[de]isoquinoline hydrochloride. The empirical formula is C 19 H 24 N 2 O.HCl, with a molecular weight of 332.87. Palonosetron hydrochloride exists as a single isomer and has the following structural formula: Palonosetron hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water, soluble in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in ethanol and 2-propanol. Palonosetron hydrochloride injection is a sterile, clear, colorless, non-pyrogenic, isotonic, buffered solution for intravenous administration. Palonosetron hydrochloride injection is available as 5 mL single-dose vial. Each 5 mL vial contains: 0.25 mg palonosetron (equivalent to 0.28 mg palonosetron hydrochloride), 207.5 mg mannitol, and disodium edetate and citrate buffer in water for intravenous administration. The pH of the solution in the 5 mL vial is 4.5 to 5.5. Structure.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e) are generally dose- proportional over the dose range of 0.3 mcg/kg to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S\u2011hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5\u2011HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Co-administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e) are generally dose- proportional over the dose range of 0.3 mcg/kg to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S\u2011hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5\u2011HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Co-administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron hydrochloride at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC= 29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron hydrochloride at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with either a single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m\u00b2, doxorubicin > 25 mg/m\u00b2, epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4% to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection from 0.3 mcg/kg to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m\u00b2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m\u00b2, and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [Table 5]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [Table 6] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [Table 7].

Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8, intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24-hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 Hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 20 mcg/kg intravenously (N=165) Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg for 3 intravenous doses (N=162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval] a : Palonosetron hydrochloride injection minus intravenous Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] a To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. In patients that received palonosetron hydrochloride injection at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults In a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial, palonosetron hydrochloride injection was compared to placebo for PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: \u2022 Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours \u2022 Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea \u2022 Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9. Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection vs Placebo \u0394 p-value a Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) a To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Palonosetron hydrochloride injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron hydrochloride injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron hydrochloride injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock : reported in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious or otherwise clinically significant adverse reactions reported in other sections of labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults (\u22655%) are: headache and constipation ( 6.1 ) postoperative nausea and vomiting (\u2265 2%) are: QT prolongation, bradycardia, headache, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Adverse Reaction Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg intravenously (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N=194) Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: Cardiovascular: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood Urinary System: urinary retention Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron hydrochloride injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: infusion site pain. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] are shown in Table 3 . Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron hydrochloride injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions* in Trials of Adults with Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Adverse Reaction Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously (N=336) Placebo (N=369) Electrocardiogram QT prolongation 5% 3% Bradycardia 4% 4% Headache 3% 4% Constipation 2% 3% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% of less of patients, in these PONV clinical trials were: Cardiovascular: QTc prolongation, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, blood pressure decreased, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, generalized edema, ECG T wave amplitude decreased, platelet count decreased. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. Dermatological: pruritus Gastrointestinal System: flatulence, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia General: chills Liver: increases in AST and/or ALT, hepatic enzyme increased Metabolic: hypokalemia, anorexia Nervous System: dizziness Respiratory: hypoventilation, laryngospasm Urinary System: urinary retention 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of palonosetron hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions: including dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Injection site reactions: including burning, induration, discomfort and pain"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron hydrochloride use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron hydrochloride during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron hydrochloride at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron hydrochloride and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron hydrochloride injection dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.3 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron hydrochloride at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC= 29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron hydrochloride at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with either a single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin > 25 mg/m 2 , epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m 2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [ Table 5 ]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [ Table 6 ] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [ Table 7 ].

The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8 , intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24-hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 Hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates a To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin.

All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron hydrochloride injection doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9 . Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates a To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection vs Placebo \u0394 p-value a Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) Palonosetron hydrochloride injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron hydrochloride injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron hydrochloride injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."

Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults (incidence \u22655%) are headache and constipation ( 6.1 ). The most common adverse reactions in postoperative nausea and vomiting (incidence \u2265 2%) are QT prolongation, bradycardia, headache, and constipation ( 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla USA, Inc., at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 1374 adult patients received palonosetron. Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity with Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection and ondansetron or dolasetron. Following is a listing of all adverse reactions reported by 2% of patients in these trials (Table 1). Table 1: Adverse Reactions from Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Studies \u2265 2% in any Treatment Group Event Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.25 mg (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg I.V. (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg I.V. (N=194) Headache 60 (9%) 34 (8%) 32 (16%) Constipation 29 (5%) 8 (2%) 12 (6%) Diarrhea 8 (1%) 7 (2%) 4 (2%) Dizziness 8 (1%) 9 (2%) 4 (2%) Fatigue 3 (< 1%) 4 (1%) 4 (2%) Abdominal Pain 1 (< 1%) 2 (< 1%) 3 (2%) Insomnia 1 (< 1%) 3 (1%) 3 (2%) In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron dose of approximately 0.75 mg, three times the recommended dose. One patient received a 10 mcg/kg oral dose in a post-operative nausea and vomiting study and one healthy subject received a 0.75 mg I.V. dose in a pharmacokinetic study. In clinical trials, the following infrequently reported adverse reactions, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following administration of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection to adult patients receiving concomitant cancer chemotherapy: Cardiovascular : 1%: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, < 1%: hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation. In many cases, the relationship to Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection was unclear. Dermatological: < 1%: allergic dermatitis, rash. Hearing and Vision: < 1%: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia. Gastrointestinal System: 1%: diarrhea, < 1%: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence. General: 1%: weakness, < 1%: fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome. Liver: < 1%: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Metabolic: 1%: hyperkalemia, < 1%: electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia. Musculoskeletal: < 1%: arthralgia. Nervous System: 1%: dizziness, < 1%: somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia. Psychiatric: 1%: anxiety, < 1%: euphoric mood. Urinary System: < 1%: urinary retention. Vascular: < 1%: vein discoloration, vein distention. Pediatrics In a pediatric clinical trial for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting 163 cancer patients received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy. Patients had a mean age of 8.4 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 46% male; and 93% white. The following adverse reactions were reported for palonosetron: Nervous System: <1%: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: <1%: infusion site pain. Dermatological: <1%: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. In the trial, adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. 6.2 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The adverse reactions cited in Table 2 were reported in \u2265 2% of adults receiving I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.075 mg immediately before induction of anesthesia in one phase 2 and two phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials. Rates of events between palonosetron and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. Please refer to Section 12.2, thorough QT/QTc study results, for data demonstrating the lack of palonosetron effect on QT/QTc. Table 2: Adverse Reactions from Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies \u2265 2% in any Treatment Group Event Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.075 mg (N=336) Placebo (N=369) Electrocardiogram QT prolongation 16 (5%) 11 (3%) Bradycardia 13 (4%) 16 (4%) Headache 11 (3%) 14 (4%) Constipation 8 (2%) 11(3%) In these clinical trials, the following infrequently reported adverse reactions, assessed by investigators as treatment-related or causality unknown, occurred following administration of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection to adult patients receiving concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications including those associated with anesthesia: Cardiovascular: 1%: electrocardiogram QTc prolongation, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, < 1%: blood pressure decreased, hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles, generalized edema, ECG T wave amplitude decreased, platelet count decreased. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. Dermatological: 1%: pruritus. Gastrointestinal System: 1%: flatulence, < 1%: dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility, anorexia. General: < 1%: chills. Liver: 1%: increases in AST and/or ALT, < 1%: hepatic enzyme increased. Metabolic: < 1%: hypokalemia, anorexia. Nervous System: < 1%: dizziness. Respiratory: < 1%: hypoventilation, laryngospasm. Urinary System: 1%: urinary retention. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Very rare cases (<1/10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock and injection site reactions (burning, induration, discomfort and pain) were reported from postmarketing experience of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.25 mg in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Palonosetron is eliminated from the body through both renal excretion and metabolic pathways with the latter mediated via multiple CYP enzymes. Further in vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. Coadministration of 0.25 mg I.V. palonosetron and 20 mg I.V. dexamethasone in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. In an interaction study in healthy subjects where palonosetron 0.25 mg (I.V. bolus) was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). A study in healthy volunteers involving single-dose I.V. palonosetron (0.75 mg) and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. In controlled clinical trials, Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics /antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents. Palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumor activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C) in murine tumor models. The potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low ( 7 )"

In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1894 and 3789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Animal Data In animal studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection is present in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants and the potential for tumorigenicity shown for palonosetron in the rat carcinogenicity study [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to <17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Safety and effectiveness of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (max 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (max 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to <17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared I.V. palonosetron (1 mcg/kg, max 0.075 mg) versus I.V. ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to <17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults (Table 2). 8.5 Geriatric Use Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients \u2265 65 years of age and younger patients (18 to 64 years). Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of palonosetron, 316 (23%) were \u2265 65 years old, while 71 (5%) were \u2265 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and the younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. No dose adjustment or special monitoring are required for geriatric patients. Of the 1520 adult patients in Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection PONV clinical studies, 73 (5%) were \u2265 65 years old. No overall differences in safety were observed between older and younger subjects in these studies, though the possibility of heightened sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be excluded. No differences in efficacy were observed in geriatric patients for the CINV indication and none are expected for geriatric PONV patients. However, Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection efficacy in geriatric patients has not been adequately evaluated. 8.6 Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. 8.8 Race Intravenous palonosetron pharmacokinetics was characterized in twenty-four healthy Japanese subjects over the dose range of 3 \u2013 90 mcg/kg. Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, no dose adjustment is required. The pharmacokinetics of palonosetron in Blacks has not been adequately characterized."

Fifty adult cancer patients were administered palonosetron at a dose of 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to 6 mg fixed dose) as part of a dose ranging study. This is approximately 25 times the recommended dose of 0.25 mg. This dose group had a similar incidence of adverse events compared to the other dose groups and no dose response effects were observed. Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for palonosetron overdose. A single intravenous dose of palonosetron at 30 mg/kg (947 and 474 times the human dose for rats and mice, respectively, based on body surface area) was lethal to rats and mice. The major signs of toxicity were convulsions, gasping, pallor, cyanosis and collapse."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re\u2011polarization and to prolong action potential duration. The effect of palonosetron on QTc interval was evaluated in a double blind, randomized, parallel, placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controlled trial in adult men and women. The objective was to evaluate the ECG effects of I.V. administered palonosetron at single doses of 0.25, 0.75 or 2.25 mg in 221 healthy subjects. The study demonstrated no significant effect on any ECG interval including QTc duration (cardiac repolarization) at doses up to 2.25 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3\u201390 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following single I.V. dose of palonosetron at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean ( \u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h mcg/L. Following I.V. administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following I.V. administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half\u2011life is approximately 40 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Single-dose I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Following single dose intravenous infusion of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 20 mcg/kg, peak plasma concentrations (C T ) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients < 6 years than in older patients. Median half-life was 29.5 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half\u2011life is approximately 40 hours. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Single-dose I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Following single dose intravenous infusion of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 20 mcg/kg, peak plasma concentrations (C T ) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients < 6 years than in older patients. Median half-life was 29.5 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC= 29.8 h mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test, or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Adults Efficacy of single-dose palonosetron injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting induced by both moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy was studied in three Phase 3 trials and one Phase 2 trial. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two Phase 3, double-blind trials involving 1132 patients compared single-dose I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection with either single-dose I.V. ondansetron (study 1) or dolasetron (study 2) given 30 minutes prior to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin > 25 mg/m 2 , epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in study 1 and were only used by 4-6% of patients in study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A Phase 2, double-blind, dose-ranging study evaluated the efficacy of single-dose I.V. palonosetron from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving highly-emetogenic chemotherapy (either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m 2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m 2 ). Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy. A Phase 3, double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared single-dose I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection with single-dose I.V. ondansetron (study 3) given 30 minutes prior to highly emetogenic chemotherapy including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results The antiemetic activity of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection was evaluated during the acute phase (0-24 hours) [Table 4], delayed phase (24-120 hours) [Table 5], and overall phase (0-120 hours) [Table 6] post-chemotherapy in Phase 3 trials.

The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 7, intravenous Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24 hour time interval. Table 7: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0-24 hours): Complete Response Rates * To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 20 mcg/kg (N=165) I.V. Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg x 3 (N=162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval]*: I.V. Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection minus I.V. Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] In patients that received Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting In one multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 clinical study (Study 1), palonosetron was compared with placebo for the prevention of PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. Study 1 was a pivotal study conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of post operative nausea and vomiting and/or motion sickness. In Study 1 patients were randomized to receive palonosetron 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. The antiemetic activity of palonosetron was evaluated during the 0 to 72 hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with 0.075 mg palonosetron in Study 1 and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 37.9 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in the 0-24 and in the 24-72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: Complete Response (CR) 0-48 and 0-72 hours Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis in Study 1 was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Results for Complete Response in Study 1 for 0.075 mg palonosetron versus placebo are described in the following table. Table 8: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: Complete Response (CR), Study 1, Palonosetron 0.075 mg Vs Placebo * To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron Vs Placebo \u0394 p-value* Co-primary Endpoints CR 0-24 hours Palonosetron 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) CR 24-72 hours Palonosetron 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) Palonosetron 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A phase 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate I.V. palonosetron for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five I.V. palonosetron doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 \u00b5g/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron 1 \u00b5g/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004. Palonosetron 1 \u00b5g/kg also significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009. Image Image Image"

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic shock : reported in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. (5.1) Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single-dose of palonosetron, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) Adverse Reaction Palonosetron 0.25 mg intravenously (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N=194) * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: Cardiovascular: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood Urinary System: urinary retention Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: infusion site pain. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] are shown in Table 3. Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron HCl use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron HCl during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.3) ]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote to palonosetron. Overdose should be managed with supportive care. Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for palonosetron overdose. A single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 30 mg/kg (947 and 474 times the human dose for rats and mice, respectively, based on body surface area) was lethal to rats and mice. The major signs of toxicity were convulsions, gasping, pallor, cyanosis and collapse."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5,630 \u00b1 5,480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.16 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 \u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (C T ) reported at the end of the 15 minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron HCl at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC = 29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron HCl at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron with either a single-dose ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide < 1,500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin > 25 mg/m 2 , epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC (either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m 2 or cyclophosphamide > 1,100 mg/m 2 ). Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron with single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide > 1,500 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [Table 5]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [Table 6] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [Table 7].

The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8, intravenous palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24 hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 Hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates a To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. Palonosetron 20 mcg/kg intravenously (N = 165) Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg for 3 intravenous doses (N = 162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval] a : Palonosetron minus intravenous Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] In patients that received palonosetron at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults In a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial, palonosetron was compared to placebo for PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the U.S. in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron 0.025 mg, 0.05 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of palonosetron was evaluated during the 0 to 72 hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9. Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates a To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron Vs Placebo \u0394 p-value a Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) Palonosetron as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron for the PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p = 0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p = 0.009."

If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron HCl injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron HCl injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron HCl injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron HCl injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron HCl injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron HCl injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy \u2022 Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia \u2022 Musculoskeletal: arthralgia \u2022 Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia \u2022 Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood \u2022 Urinary System: urinary retention \u2022 Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron HCl injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron HCl injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron HCl injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: \u2022 Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. \u2022 General: infusion site pain. \u2022 Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] are shown in Table 3 . Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron HCl injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron HCl injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron HCl use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron HCl during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron HCl injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron HCl injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron HCl injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron HCl injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1 SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 \u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (C T ) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Co-administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron HCl injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron HCl injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron HCl injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body.

Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron HCl at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC=29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron HCl at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron HCl at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC=29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron HCl injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron HCl injection with either a single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m\u00b2, doxorubicin > 25 mg/m\u00b2, epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m\u00b2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m\u00b2, and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron HCl injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [ Table 5 ]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron HCl injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [ Table 6 ] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [ Table 7 ].

The total population (N=327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron HCl injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron HCl injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron HCl injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron HCl injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8 , intravenous palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24 hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates Palonosetron HCl injection 20 mcg/kg intravenously (N=165) Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg for 3 intravenous doses (N=162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval]*: Palonosetron HCl injection minus intravenous Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] *To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. In patients that received palonosetron HCl injection at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults In a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial, palonosetron HCl injection was compared to placebo for PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, nonsmoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron HCl injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: \u2022 Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours \u2022 Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea \u2022 Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9. Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron HCl Injection Vs Placebo \u0394 p-value * Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) *To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Palonosetron HCl injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that Palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron HCl injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron HCl injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."

If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron hydrochloride [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron hydrochloride in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron hydrochloride is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions * in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) * Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Adverse Reaction Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.25 mg intravenously (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N=194) Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: Cardiovascular: non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular extrasystoles and QT prolongation Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood Urinary System: urinary retention Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: infusion site pain. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] are shown in Table 3 . Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron hydrochloride use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron hydrochloride during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron hydrochloride at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for palonosetron and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron hydrochloride, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067 \u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (C T ) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC= 29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron hydrochloride at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single-dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with either single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin > 25 mg/m 2 , epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m 2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [ Table 5 ]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [ Table 6 ] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [ Table 7 ].

The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8 , intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24-hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 Hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates a To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. Palonosetron Hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg intravenously (N=165) Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg for 3 intravenous doses (N=162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval] a : Palonosetron Hydrochloride minus intravenous Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] In patients that received palonosetron hydrochloride at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults In a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial, palonosetron was compared to placebo for PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of palonosetron was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in Table 9 . Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates a To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron vs Placebo \u0394 p-value a Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) Palonosetron as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."

If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) Serotonin syndrome: reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron hydrochloride injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron hydrochloride injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] ."

Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all 3 treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2.

Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, rash Hearing and Vision: motion sickness, tinnitus, eye irritation and amblyopia Gastrointestinal System: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence General: weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash, flu-like syndrome Liver: transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin. These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia Musculoskeletal: arthralgia Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood Urinary System: urinary retention Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron hydrochloride injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General: infusion site pain. Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] are shown in Table 3. Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron hydrochloride injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron HCl use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron HCl during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron hydrochloride injection and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Ch e m o th era p y - Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified noninferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 )] . No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron hydrochloride injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42\u00b134%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110\u00b145%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4. The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Coadministration of 0.25 mg palonosetron hydrochloride injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron hydrochloride injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron hydrochloride injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with either a single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m 2 , doxorubicin > 25 mg/m 2 , epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m 2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m 2 . Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m 2 , cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m 2 , and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron hydrochloride injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [Table 5]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron hydrochloride I injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [Table 6] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [Table 7].

Table 5 Table 6 Table 7 14.2 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy, Including HEC in Pediatric Patients One double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted in pediatric cancer patients. The total population (N = 327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8, intravenous palonosetron hydrochloride 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24-hour time interval. Table 8: Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 Hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 20 mcg/kg intravenously (N=165) Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg for 3 intravenous doses (N=162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval] a : Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection minus intravenous Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. In patients that received palonosetron hydrochloride injection at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults In a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial, palonosetron hydrochloride injection was compared to placebo for PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9. Table 9: Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection vs Placebo \u2206 p-value a Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron Hydrochloride Injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Palonosetron hydrochloride injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that palonosetron hydrochloride injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron hydrochloride injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron hydrochloride injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."

If symptoms occur, discontinue palonosetron and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Serotonin syndrome: reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron HCl injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue palonosetron HCl injection and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate palonosetron HCl injection in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of palonosetron HCl injection and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue palonosetron HCl injection and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if palonosetron HCl injection is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]."

These changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy \u2022 Metabolic: hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, appetite decrease, anorexia \u2022 Musculoskeletal: arthralgia \u2022 Nervous System: dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia \u2022 Psychiatric: anxiety, euphoric mood \u2022 Urinary System: urinary retention \u2022 Vascular: vein discoloration, vein distention In other studies, 2 subjects experienced severe constipation following a single palonosetron HCl injection dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of 8 years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron HCl injection 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron HCl injection for up to 4 chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: \u2022 Nervous System: headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. \u2022 General: infusion site pain. \u2022 Dermatological: allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] are shown in Table 3 . Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron HCl injection and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron HCl injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ].

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on palonosetron HCl use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed with the administration of oral palonosetron HCl during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 1,894 and 3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose in rats and rabbits, respectively ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in pregnant rats given oral palonosetron HCl at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (1,894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or pregnant rabbits given oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (3,789 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) during the period of organogenesis. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of palonosetron in human milk, the effects of palonosetron on the breastfed infant, or the effects of palonosetron on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for palonosetron and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed infant from palonosetron or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron HCl injection have been established in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 17 years for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including HEC. Use is supported by a clinical trial where 165 pediatric patients aged 2 months to less than 17 years were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron HCl injection 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . While this study demonstrated that pediatric patients require a higher palonosetron dose than adults to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, the safety profile is consistent with the established profile in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Safety and effectiveness of palonosetron HCl injection in neonates (less than 1 month of age) have not been established. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Studies Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Two pediatric trials were performed. Pediatric Study 1, a dose finding study was conducted to compare two doses of palonosetron, 1 mcg/kg (maximum 0.075 mg) versus 3 mcg/kg (maximum 0.25 mg). A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 ) ]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

A total of 150 pediatric surgical patients participated, age range 1 month to less than 17 years. No dose response was observed. Pediatric Study 2, a multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel group, active control, single-dose non-inferiority study, compared intravenous palonosetron HCl (1 mcg/kg, maximum 0.075 mg) versus intravenous ondansetron. A total of 670 pediatric surgical patients participated, age 30 days to less than 17 years. The primary efficacy endpoint, Complete Response (CR: no vomiting, no retching, and no antiemetic rescue medication) during the first 24 hours postoperatively was achieved in 78.2% of patients in the palonosetron group and 82.7% in the ondansetron group. Given the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%, the stratum adjusted Mantel-Haenszel statistical non-inferiority confidence interval for the difference in the primary endpoint, complete response (CR), was [-10.5, 1.7%], therefore non-inferiority was not demonstrated. Adverse reactions to palonosetron were similar to those reported in adults."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 1374 adult cancer patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 316 (23%) were 65 years and over, while 71 (5%) were at least 75 years and over. Of the 1520 adult patients in clinical studies of intravenously administered palonosetron HCl, 73 (5%) were at least 65 years old [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.3 ) ]. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Population pharmacokinetics analysis did not reveal any differences in palonosetron pharmacokinetics between cancer patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. No dose adjustment is required for geriatric patients."

Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for palonosetron overdose. A single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 30 mg/kg (947 and 474 times the human dose for rats and mice, respectively, based on body surface area) was lethal to rats and mice. The major signs of toxicity were convulsions, gasping, pallor, cyanosis and collapse."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Palonosetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist with a strong binding affinity for this receptor and little or no affinity for other receptors. Cancer chemotherapy may be associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting, particularly when certain agents, such as cisplatin, are used. 5-HT 3 receptors are located on the nerve terminals of the vagus in the periphery and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema. It is thought that chemotherapeutic agents produce nausea and vomiting by releasing serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine and that the released serotonin then activates 5-HT 3 receptors located on vagal afferents to initiate the vomiting reflex. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is influenced by multiple patient, surgical and anesthesia related factors and is triggered by release of 5-HT in a cascade of neuronal events involving both the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. The 5-HT 3 receptor has been demonstrated to selectively participate in the emetic response. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of intravenous palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to intravenous ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials. In PONV clinical trials the effect of palonosetron on the QTc interval was no different from placebo. In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarization and to prolong action potential duration. At a dose of 9 times the maximum recommended adult dose, palonosetron HCl injection does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl in healthy subjects and cancer patients, an initial decline in palonosetron plasma concentrations is followed by a slow elimination from the body. Mean maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-\u221e ) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. Following a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl at 3 mcg/kg (or 0.21 mg/70 kg) to six cancer patients, mean (\u00b1 SD) maximum plasma concentration was estimated to be 5630 \u00b1 5480 ng/L and mean AUC was 35.8 \u00b1 20.9 h\u2022mcg/L. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl injection 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 cancer patients, the mean increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 \u00b1 34%. Following intravenous administration of palonosetron HCl injection 0.25 mg once daily for 3 days in 12 healthy subjects, the mean (\u00b1 SD) increase in plasma palonosetron concentration from Day 1 to Day 3 was 110 \u00b1 45%. After intravenous dosing of palonosetron HCl injection in patients undergoing surgery (abdominal surgery or vaginal hysterectomy), the pharmacokinetic characteristics of palonosetron were similar to those observed in cancer patients. Distribution Palonosetron has a volume of distribution of approximately 8.3 \u00b1 2.5 L/kg. Approximately 62% of palonosetron is bound to plasma proteins. Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 mcg/kg [ 14 C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose. In healthy subjects, the total body clearance of palonosetron was 0.160 \u00b1 0.035 L/h/kg and renal clearance was 0.067\u00b1 0.018 L/h/kg. Mean terminal elimination half-life is approximately 40 hours. Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by multiple routes with approximately 50% metabolized to form two primary metabolites: N-oxide-palonosetron and 6-S-hydroxy-palonosetron. These metabolites each have less than 1% of the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron. In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron. However, clinical pharmacokinetic parameters are not significantly different between poor and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a subset of pediatric cancer patients that received 10 mcg/kg or 20 mcg/kg as a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection. When the dose was increased from 10 mcg/kg to 20 mcg/kg a dose-proportional increase in mean AUC was observed. Peak plasma concentrations (CT) reported at the end of the 15-minute infusion of 20 mcg/kg were highly variable in all age groups and tended to be lower in patients less than 6 years than in older patients as shown in Table 4 . The median half-life was 30 hours in overall age groups and ranged from about 20 to 30 hours across age groups after administration of 20 mcg/kg. The total body clearance (L/h/kg) in patients 12 to 17 years old was similar to that in healthy adults. There are no apparent differences in volume of distribution when expressed as L/kg.

Total body clearance was 25% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Whites, however, this increase is not considered to be clinically meaningful. Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment does not significantly affect palonosetron pharmacokinetic parameters. Total systemic exposure increased by approximately 28% in patients with severe renal impairment relative to healthy subjects. This increase is not considered clinically meaningful. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment does not significantly affect total body clearance of palonosetron compared to the healthy subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies indicated that palonosetron is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C19 was not investigated) nor does it induce the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5. Therefore, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions with palonosetron appears to be low. Dexamethasone Co-administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron HCl injection and 20 mg dexamethasone administered intravenously in healthy subjects revealed no pharmacokinetic drug-interactions between palonosetron and dexamethasone. Oral Aprepitant In an interaction study in healthy subjects where a single 0.25 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection was administered on day 1 and oral aprepitant for 3 days (125 mg/80 mg/80 mg), the pharmacokinetics of palonosetron were not significantly altered (AUC: no change, C max : 15% increase). Metoclopramide A study in healthy subjects involving a single 0.75 mg intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection and steady state oral metoclopramide (10 mg four times daily) demonstrated no significant pharmacokinetic interaction. Corticosteroids, Analgesics, Antiemetics/Antinauseants, Antispasmodics and Anticholinergic Agents In controlled clinical trials, palonosetron HCl injection has been safely administered with corticosteroids, analgesics, antiemetics/antinauseants, antispasmodics and anticholinergic agents."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, animals were treated with oral doses of palonosetron HCl at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day. Treatment with palonosetron was not tumorigenic. The highest tested dose produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of about 150 to 289 times the human exposure (AUC=29.8 h\u2022mcg/L) at the recommended intravenous dose of 0.25 mg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, male and female rats were treated with oral doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day and 15, 45 and 90 mg/kg/day, respectively. The highest doses produced a systemic exposure to palonosetron (Plasma AUC) of 137 and 308 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. Treatment with palonosetron produced increased incidences of adrenal benign pheochromocytoma and combined benign and malignant pheochromocytoma, increased incidences of pancreatic Islet cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma and pituitary adenoma in male rats. In female rats, it produced hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma and increased the incidences of thyroid C-cell adenoma and combined adenoma and carcinoma. Palonosetron was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the Chinese hamster ovarian cell (CHO/HGPRT) forward mutation test, the ex vivo hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the mouse micronucleus test. It was, however, positive for clastogenic effects in the Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell chromosomal aberration test. Palonosetron HCl at oral doses up to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1894 times the recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC and HEC in Adults Efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with MEC or HEC were studied in 4 trials. In these double-blind studies, complete response rates (no emetic episodes and no rescue medication) and other efficacy parameters were assessed through at least 120 hours after administration of chemotherapy. The safety and efficacy of palonosetron HCl injection in repeated courses of chemotherapy was also assessed. Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Two double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) involving 1132 patients compared a single dose of palonosetron HCl injection with either a single-dose of ondansetron (Study 1) or dolasetron (Study 2) given 30 minutes prior to MEC, including carboplatin, cisplatin \u2264 50 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide < 1500 mg/m\u00b2, doxorubicin > 25 mg/m\u00b2, epirubicin, irinotecan, and methotrexate > 250 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically in Study 1 and were only used by 4 to 6% of patients in Study 2. The majority of patients in these studies were women (77%), White (65%) and na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy (54%). The mean age was 55 years. Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy A double-blind, dose-ranging trial evaluated the efficacy of a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection from 0.3 to 90 mcg/kg (equivalent to < 0.1 mg to 6 mg fixed dose) in 161 chemotherapy-na\u00efve adult cancer patients receiving HEC, either cisplatin \u2265 70 mg/m\u00b2 or cyclophosphamide > 1100 mg/m\u00b2. Concomitant corticosteroids were not administered prophylactically. Analysis of data from this trial indicates that 0.25 mg is the lowest effective dose in preventing acute nausea and vomiting associated with HEC. A double-blind trial involving 667 patients compared a single intravenous dose of palonosetron HCl injection with a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (Study 3) given 30 minutes prior to HEC, including cisplatin \u2265 60 mg/m\u00b2, cyclophosphamide > 1500 mg/m\u00b2, and dacarbazine. Corticosteroids were co-administered prophylactically before chemotherapy in 67% of patients. Of the 667 patients, 51% were women, 60% White, and 59% na\u00efve to previous chemotherapy. The mean age was 52 years. Efficacy Results Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that palonosetron HCl injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of MEC and HEC in the acute phase (0 to 24 hours) [ Table 5 ]. Clinical superiority over other 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists has not been adequately demonstrated in the acute phase. In Study 3, efficacy was greater when prophylactic corticosteroids were administered concomitantly. Studies 1 and 2 show that palonosetron HCl injection was effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat course of MEC in the delayed phase (24 to 120 hours) [Table 6] and overall phase (0 to 120 hours) [ Table 7 ].

The total population (N=327) had a mean age of 8.3 years (range 2 months to 16.9 years) and were 53% male; and 96% white. Patients were randomized and received a 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron HCl injection 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by placebo infusions 4 and 8 hours after the dose of palonosetron HCl injection) or 0.15 mg/kg of intravenous ondansetron 30 minutes prior to the start of emetogenic chemotherapy (followed by ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg infusions 4 and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, with a maximum total dose of 32 mg). Emetogenic chemotherapies administered included doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (<1500 mg/m 2 ), ifosfamide, cisplatin, dactinomycin, carboplatin, and daunorubicin. Adjuvant corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, were administered with chemotherapy in 55% of patients. Complete Response in the acute phase of the first cycle of chemotherapy was defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no rescue medication in the first 24 hours after starting chemotherapy. Efficacy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of intravenous palonosetron HCl injection compared to intravenous ondansetron. Non-inferiority criteria were met if the lower bound of the 97.5% confidence interval for the difference in Complete Response rates of intravenous palonosetron HCl injection minus intravenous ondansetron was larger than -15%. The non-inferiority margin was 15%. Efficacy Results As shown in Table 8 , intravenous palonosetron 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) demonstrated non-inferiority to the active comparator during the 0 to 24 hour time interval. Table 8. Prevention of Acute Nausea and Vomiting (0 to 24 hours) Associated with Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Pediatric Patients: Complete Response Rates Palonosetron HCl injection 20 mcg/kg intravenously (N=165) Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg for 3 intravenous doses (N=162) Difference [97.5% Confidence Interval]*: Palonosetron HCl injection minus intravenous Ondansetron Comparator 59.4% 58.6% 0.36% [-11.7%, 12.4%] * To adjust for multiplicity of treatment groups, a lower-bound of a 97.5% confidence interval was used to compare to -15%, the negative value of the non-inferiority margin. In patients that received palonosetron HCl injection at a lower dose than the recommended dose of 20 mcg/kg, non-inferiority criteria were not met. 14.3 Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults In a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial, palonosetron HCl injection was compared to placebo for PONV in 546 patients undergoing abdominal and gynecological surgery. All patients received general anesthesia. The trial was conducted predominantly in the US in the out-patient setting for patients undergoing elective gynecologic or abdominal laparoscopic surgery and stratified at randomization for the following risk factors: gender, non-smoking status, history of PONV and/or motion sickness. Patients were randomized to receive a single dose of palonosetron HCl injection 0.025 mg, 0.050 mg or 0.075 mg or placebo, each given intravenously immediately prior to induction of anesthesia. Antiemetic activity of was evaluated during the 0 to 72-hour time period after surgery. Of the 138 patients treated with palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg and evaluated for efficacy, 96% were women; 66% had a history of PONV or motion sickness; 85% were non-smokers. As for race, 63% were White, 20% were Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 1% were Asian. The age of patients ranged from 21 to 74 years, with a mean age of 38 years. Three patients were greater than 65 years of age. Co-primary efficacy measures were Complete Response (CR) defined as no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication in 0 to 24 hours and 24 to 72 hours postoperatively. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: \u2022 Complete Response (CR) 0 to 48 hours and 0 to 72 hours \u2022 Complete Control (CC) defined as CR and no more than mild nausea \u2022 Severity of nausea (none, mild, moderate, severe) The primary hypothesis was that at least one of the three palonosetron doses were superior to placebo. Complete Response Rates for palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg and placebo in this trial are described in the Table 9. Table 9. Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting in Adults: Complete Response Rates Treatment n/N (%) Palonosetron HCl injection Vs Placebo \u0394 p-value * Co-primary Endpoints Complete Response Rate (0 to 24 hours) Palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg intravenously 59/138 (42.8%) 16.8% 0.004 Placebo 35/135 (25.9%) Complete Response Rate (24 to 72 hours) Palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg intravenously 67/138 (48.6%) 7.8% 0.188 Placebo 55/135 (40.7%) *To reach statistical significance for each co-primary endpoint, the required significance limit for the lowest p-value was p<0.017. \u0394 Difference (%): palonosetron 0.075 mg minus placebo Palonosetron HCl injection as a single dose of 0.075 mg reduced the severity of nausea compared to placebo. Analyses of other secondary endpoints indicate that Palonosetron HCl injection 0.075 mg was numerically better than placebo, however, statistical significance was not formally demonstrated. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study was performed to evaluate palonosetron HCl injection for PONV following abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Five intravenous doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 30 mcg/kg) were evaluated in a total of 381 intent-to-treat patients. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients with CR in the first 24 hours after recovery from surgery. The lowest effective dose was palonosetron HCl injection 1 mcg/kg (approximately 0.075 mg) which had a CR rate of 44% versus 19% for placebo, p=0.004 and significantly reduced the severity of nausea versus placebo, p=0.009."
