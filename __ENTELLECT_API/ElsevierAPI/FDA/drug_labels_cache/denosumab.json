      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pregnancy must be ruled out prior to administration of Denosumab-bmwo. ( 2.1 ) Before initiating Denosumab-bmwo in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including dialysis patients, evaluate for the presence of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder with intact parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 8.6 ) Denosumab-bmwo should be administered by a healthcare provider. ( 2.3 ) Administer 60 mg every 6 months as a subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen. ( 2.3 ) Instruct patients to take calcium 1000 mg daily and at least 400 IU vitamin D daily. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Pregnancy Testing Prior to Initiation of Denosumab-bmwo Pregnancy must be ruled out prior to administration of Denosumab-bmwo. Perform pregnancy testing in all females of reproductive potential prior to administration of Denosumab-bmwo. Based on findings in animals, denosumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] . 2.2 Laboratory Testing in Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Prior to Initiation of Denosumab-bmwo In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ], including dialysis-dependent patients, evaluate for the presence of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and 1,25 (OH) 2 vitamin D prior to decisions regarding Denosumab-bmwo treatment. Consider also assessing bone turnover status (serum markers of bone turnover or bone biopsy) to evaluate the underlying bone disease that may be present [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 2.3 Recommended Dosage Denosumab-bmwo should be administered by a healthcare provider. The recommended dose of Denosumab-bmwo is 60 mg administered as a single subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Administer Denosumab-bmwo via subcutaneous injection in the upper arm, the upper thigh, or the abdomen. All patients should receive calcium 1000 mg daily and at least 400 IU vitamin D daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If a dose of Denosumab-bmwo is missed, administer the injection as soon as the patient is available. Thereafter, schedule injections every 6 months from the date of the last injection. 2.4 Preparation and Administration Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Denosumab-bmwo is a clear, colorless to pale yellow solution. Do not use if the solution is discolored or cloudy or if the solution contains particles or foreign particulate matter. Prior to administration, Denosumab-bmwo may be removed from the refrigerator and brought to room temperature up to 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) by standing in the original carton. This generally takes 15 to 30 minutes. Do not warm Denosumab-bmwo in any other way [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] . Instructions for Administration of Prefilled Syringe with Safety Guard IMPORTANT: To reduce the risk of accidental needle stick injury, each prefilled syringe has a safety guard that is automatically activated to cover the needle after you have given the injection. Do not pull back on the plunger rod at any time. Step 1: Remove the Needle Cap Dispose of the needle cap right away in the nearest sharps disposal container. DO NOT re-cap the prefilled syringe. Image Image Step 2: Administer Subcutaneous Injection Choose an appropriate injection site. The recommended injection sites for Denosumab-bmwo include: the outer area of the upper arms OR the upper legs (thighs) OR around the stomach area (abdomen). Inject all of the liquid by using your thumb to push the plunger rod all the way down. If the plunger rod is not fully pressed, the safety guard will not extend to cover the needle when it is removed. Image Image Step 3: Remove the prefilled syringe from the injection site After the prefilled syringe is empty, slowly remove the needle by lifting your thumb from the plunger rod until the needle is completely covered by the safety guard. Do not rub the injection site. Immediately dispose of the prefilled syringe in the nearest sharps disposal container. Image"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypocalcemia: Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating Denosumab-bmwo. May worsen, especially in patients with renal impairment. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk. Evaluate for presence of chronic kidney disease mineral-bone disorder. Monitor serum calcium. ( 5.1 ) Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Denosumab-bmwo should not receive other denosumab products concomitantly. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reactions may occur. Discontinue permanently if a clinically significant reaction occurs. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Has been reported with denosumab products. Monitor for symptoms. ( 5.4 ) Atypical femoral fractures: Have been reported. Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) Multiple vertebral fractures have been reported following treatment discontinuation. Patients should be transitioned to another antiresorptive agent if Denosumab-bmwo is discontinued. ( 5.6 ) Serious infections including skin infections: May occur, including those leading to hospitalization. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of infection, including cellulitis. ( 5.7 ) Dermatologic reactions: Dermatitis, rashes, and eczema have been reported. Consider discontinuing Denosumab-bmwo if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.8 ) Severe bone, joint, muscle pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.9 ) Suppression of bone turnover: Significant suppression has been demonstrated. Monitor for consequences of bone over-suppression. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Severe Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Changes Denosumab products can cause severe hypocalcemia and fatal cases have been reported. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Denosumab-bmwo. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Contraindications (4) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine, treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to 14 days after Denosumab-bmwo injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D. Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e., eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ] including dialysis-dependent patients are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following denosumab products administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk. To minimize the risk of hypocalcemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, evaluate for the presence of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D prior to decisions regarding Denosumab-bmwo treatment. Consider also assessing bone turnover status (serum markers of bone turnover or bone biopsy) to evaluate the underlying bone disease that may be present. Monitor serum calcium weekly for the first month after Denosumab-bmwo administration and monthly thereafter. Instruct all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those who are dialysis-dependent, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining serum calcium levels with adequate calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation. Treatment with Denosumab-bmwo in these patients should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is experienced in diagnosis and management of CKD-MBD. 5.2 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Patients receiving Denosumab-bmwo should not receive other denosumab products concomitantly. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with denosumab products. Symptoms have included hypotension, dyspnea, throat tightness, facial and upper airway edema, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy, and discontinue further use of Denosumab-bmwo [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing. ONJ has been reported in patients receiving denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A routine oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of Denosumab-bmwo treatment. A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry is recommended prior to treatment with Denosumab-bmwo in patients with risk factors for ONJ such as invasive dental procedures (e.g. tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and comorbid disorders (e.g. periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Denosumab-bmwo. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ. The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to denosumab products. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit-risk assessment. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Denosumab-bmwo should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of Denosumab-bmwo therapy should be considered based on individual benefit-risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical low energy or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with antiresorptive agents. Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral, and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture. During Denosumab-bmwo treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Denosumab-bmwo therapy should be considered, pending a benefit-risk assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Treatment Following discontinuation of denosumab treatment, fracture risk increases, including the risk of multiple vertebral fractures. Treatment with denosumab results in significant suppression of bone turnover and cessation of denosumab treatment results in increased bone turnover above pretreatment values 9 months after the last dose of denosumab. Bone turnover then returns to pretreatment values 24 months after the last dose of denosumab. In addition, bone mineral density (BMD) returns to pretreatment values within 18 months after the last injection [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . New vertebral fractures occurred as early as 7 months (on average 19 months) after the last dose of denosumab. Prior vertebral fracture was a predictor of multiple vertebral fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Evaluate an individual's benefit-risk before initiating treatment with Denosumab-bmwo. If Denosumab-bmwo treatment is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to an alternative antiresorptive therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.7 Serious Infections In a clinical trial of over 7800 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, serious infections leading to hospitalization were reported more frequently in the denosumab group than in the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Serious skin infections, as well as infections of the abdomen, urinary tract, and ear, were more frequent in patients treated with denosumab. Endocarditis was also reported more frequently in denosumab-treated patients. The incidence of opportunistic infections was similar between placebo and denosumab groups, and the overall incidence of infections was similar between the treatment groups. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of severe infection, including cellulitis. Patients on concomitant immunosuppressant agents or with impaired immune systems may be at increased risk for serious infections. Consider the benefit-risk profile in such patients before treating with Denosumab-bmwo. In patients who develop serious infections while on Denosumab-bmwo, prescribers should assess the need for continued Denosumab-bmwo therapy. 5.8 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions In a large clinical trial of over 7800 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, epidermal and dermal adverse events such as dermatitis, eczema, and rashes occurred at a significantly higher rate in the denosumab group compared to the placebo group. Most of these events were not specific to the injection site [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Consider discontinuing Denosumab-bmwo if severe symptoms develop. 5.9 Musculoskeletal Pain In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting denosumab products. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.10 Suppression of Bone Turnover In clinical trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment with denosumab resulted in significant suppression of bone remodeling as evidenced by markers of bone turnover and bone histomorphometry [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) , Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The significance of these findings and the effect of long-term treatment with denosumab products are unknown. The long-term consequences of the degree of suppression of bone remodeling observed with denosumab may contribute to adverse outcomes such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical fractures, and delayed fracture healing. Monitor patients for these consequences. 5.11 Hypercalcemia in Pediatric Patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta Denosumab-bmwo is not approved for use in pediatric patients. Hypercalcemia has been reported in pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta treated with denosumab products. Some cases required hospitalization [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]."

Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis The safety of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of 7808 postmenopausal women aged 60 to 91 years. A total of 3876 women were exposed to placebo and 3886 women were exposed to denosumab administered subcutaneously once every 6 months as a single 60 mg dose. All women were instructed to take at least 1000 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 2.3% (n = 90) in the placebo group and 1.8% (n = 70) in the denosumab group. The incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was 24.2% in the placebo group and 25.0% in the denosumab group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 2.1% and 2.4% for the placebo and denosumab groups, respectively. The most common adverse reactions reported with denosumab in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis are back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, hypercholesterolemia, and cystitis. Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 2% of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and more frequently in the denosumab-treated women than in the placebo-treated women are shown in the table below.

The nadir in serum calcium level occurred at approximately day 10 after denosumab dosing in subjects with normal renal function. In clinical studies, subjects with impaired renal function were more likely to have greater reductions in serum calcium levels compared to subjects with normal renal function. In a study of 55 subjects with varying degrees of renal function, serum calcium levels < 7.5 mg/dL or symptomatic hypocalcemia were observed in 5 subjects. These included no subjects in the normal renal function group, 10% of subjects in the creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min group, 29% of subjects in the creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min group, and 29% of subjects in the hemodialysis group. These subjects did not receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation. In a study of 4550 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the mean change from baseline in serum calcium level 10 days after denosumab dosing was -5.5% in subjects with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min vs. -3.1% in subjects with creatinine clearance \u2265 30 mL/min. Serious Infections Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes and in lymph nodes. Therefore, a RANKL inhibitor such as denosumab products may increase the risk of infection. In the clinical study of 7808 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the incidence of infections resulting in death was 0.2% in both placebo and denosumab treatment groups. However, the incidence of nonfatal serious infections was 3.3% in the placebo and 4.0% in the denosumab groups. Hospitalizations due to serious infections in the abdomen (0.7% placebo vs. 0.9% denosumab), urinary tract (0.5% placebo vs. 0.7% denosumab), and ear (0.0% placebo vs. 0.1% denosumab) were reported. Endocarditis was reported in no placebo patients and 3 patients receiving denosumab. Skin infections, including erysipelas and cellulitis, leading to hospitalization were reported more frequently in patients treated with denosumab (< 0.1% placebo vs. 0.4% denosumab). The incidence of opportunistic infections was similar to that reported with placebo. Dermatologic Adverse Reactions A significantly higher number of patients treated with denosumab developed epidermal and dermal adverse events (such as dermatitis, eczema, and rashes), with these events reported in 8.2% of the placebo and 10.8% of the denosumab groups (p < 0.0001). Most of these events were not specific to the injection site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Osteonecrosis of the Jaw ONJ has been reported in the osteoporosis clinical trial program in patients treated with denosumab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures In the osteoporosis clinical trial program, atypical femoral fractures were reported in patients treated with denosumab. The duration of denosumab exposure to time of atypical femoral fracture diagnosis was as early as 2\u00bd years [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation In the osteoporosis clinical trial program, multiple vertebral fractures were reported in patients after discontinuation of denosumab. In the phase 3 trial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, 6% of women who discontinued denosumab and remained in the study developed new vertebral fractures, and 3% of women who discontinued denosumab and remained in the study developed multiple new vertebral fractures. The mean time to onset of multiple vertebral fractures was 17 months (range: 7-43 months) after the last injection of denosumab. Prior vertebral fracture was a predictor of multiple vertebral fractures after discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Pancreatitis Pancreatitis was reported in 4 patients (0.1%) in the placebo and 8 patients (0.2%) in the denosumab groups. Of these reports, 1 patient in the placebo group and all 8 patients in the denosumab group had serious events, including one death in the denosumab group. Several patients had a prior history of pancreatitis. The time from product administration to event occurrence was variable. New Malignancies The overall incidence of new malignancies was 4.3% in the placebo and 4.8% in the denosumab groups. New malignancies related to the breast (0.7% placebo vs. 0.9% denosumab), reproductive system (0.2% placebo vs. 0.5% denosumab), and gastrointestinal system (0.6% placebo vs. 0.9% denosumab) were reported. A causal relationship to drug exposure has not been established. Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis The safety of denosumab in the treatment of men with osteoporosis was assessed in a 1-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 120 men were exposed to placebo and 120 men were exposed to denosumab administered subcutaneously once every 6 months as a single 60 mg dose. All men were instructed to take at least 1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.8% (n = 1) in the placebo group and 0.8% (n = 1) in the denosumab group. The incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was 7.5% in the placebo group and 8.3% in the denosumab group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 0% and 2.5% for the placebo and denosumab groups, respectively. Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 5% of men with osteoporosis and more frequently with denosumab than in the placebo-treated patients were: back pain (6.7% placebo vs. 8.3% denosumab), arthralgia (5.8% placebo vs. 6.7% denosumab), and nasopharyngitis (5.8% placebo vs. 6.7% denosumab). Serious Infections Serious infection was reported in 1 patient (0.8%) in the placebo group and no patients in the denosumab group. Dermatologic Adverse Reactions Epidermal and dermal adverse events (such as dermatitis, eczema, and rashes) were reported in 4 patients (3.3%) in the placebo group and 5 patients (4.2%) in the denosumab group. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw No cases of ONJ were reported. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis was reported in 1 patient (0.8%) in the placebo group and 1 patient (0.8%) in the denosumab group. New Malignancies New malignancies were reported in no patients in the placebo group and 4 (3.3%) patients (3 prostate cancers, 1 basal cell carcinoma) in the denosumab group. Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis The safety of denosumab in the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in the 1-year, primary analysis of a 2-year randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study of 795 patients (30% men and 70% women) aged 20 to 94 (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent). A total of 384 patients were exposed to 5 mg oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control) and 394 patients were exposed to denosumab administered once every 6 months as a 60 mg subcutaneous dose. All patients were instructed to take at least 1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.5% (n = 2) in the active-control group and 1.5% (n = 6) in the denosumab group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 17% in the active-control group and 16% in the denosumab group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 3.6% and 3.8% for the active-control and denosumab groups, respectively. Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 2% of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and more frequently with denosumab than in the active-control-treated patients are shown in the table below.

Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical femoral fractures were reported in 1 patient treated with denosumab. The duration of denosumab exposure to time of atypical femoral fracture diagnosis was at 8.0 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Serious Infections S erious infection was reported in 15 patients (3.9%) in the active-control group and 17 patients (4.3%) in the denosumab group. Dermatologic Adverse Reactions Epidermal and dermal adverse events (such as dermatitis, eczema, and rashes) were reported in 16 patients (4.2%) in the active-control group and 15 patients (3.8%) in the denosumab group. Treatment of Bone Loss in Patients Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer or Adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy for Breast Cancer The safety of denosumab in the treatment of bone loss in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was assessed in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of 1468 men aged 48 to 97 years. A total of 725 men were exposed to placebo and 731 men were exposed to denosumab administered once every 6 months as a single 60 mg subcutaneous dose. All men were instructed to take at least 1000 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of serious adverse events was 30.6% in the placebo group and 34.6% in the denosumab group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 6.1% and 7.0% for the placebo and denosumab groups, respectively. The safety of denosumab in the treatment of bone loss in women with nonmetastatic breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy was assessed in a 2-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of 252 postmenopausal women aged 35 to 84 years. A total of 120 women were exposed to placebo and 129 women were exposed to denosumab administered once every 6 months as a single 60 mg subcutaneous dose. All women were instructed to take at least 1000 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. The incidence of serious adverse events was 9.2% in the placebo group and 14.7% in the denosumab group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 4.2% and 0.8% for the placebo and denosumab groups, respectively. Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 10% of denosumab-treated patients receiving ADT for prostate cancer or adjuvant AI therapy for breast cancer, and more frequently than in the placebo-treated patients were: arthralgia (13.0% placebo vs. 14.3% denosumab) and back pain (10.5% placebo vs. 11.5% denosumab). Pain in extremity (7.7% placebo vs. 9.9% denosumab) and musculoskeletal pain (3.8% placebo vs. 6.0% denosumab) have also been reported in clinical trials. Additionally, in denosumab-treated men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT, a greater incidence of cataracts was observed (1.2% placebo vs. 4.7% denosumab). Hypocalcemia (serum calcium < 8.4 mg/dL) was reported only in denosumab-treated patients (2.4% vs. 0.0%) at the month 1 visit. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of denosumab products: Drug-related hypersensitivity reactions: anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, facial swelling, and erythema Hypocalcemia: severe symptomatic hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events, and fatal cases Musculoskeletal pain, including severe cases Parathyroid hormone (PTH): Marked elevation in serum PTH in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) or receiving dialysis Multiple vertebral fractures following treatment discontinuation Cutaneous and mucosal lichenoid drug eruptions (e.g., lichen planus-like reactions) Alopecia Vasculitis (e.g. ANCA positive vasculitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis) Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnant women and females of reproductive potential: Denosumab products may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Denosumab-bmwo. ( 8.1 , 8 3 ) Pediatric patients: Denosumab-bmwo is not approved for use in pediatric patients. ( 8.4 ) Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including dialysis-dependent patients, are at greater risk of severe hypocalcemia. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. ( 5.1 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Denosumab-bmwo is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because it may cause harm to a fetus. There are insufficient data with denosumab products use in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes. In utero denosumab exposure from cynomolgus monkeys dosed monthly with denosumab throughout pregnancy at a dose 50-fold higher than the recommended human dose based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality, and absent lymph nodes, abnormal bone growth, and decreased neonatal growth [see Data ] . Data Animal Data The effects of denosumab on prenatal development have been studied in both cynomolgus monkeys and genetically engineered mice in which RANK ligand (RANKL) expression was turned off by gene removal (a \"knockout mouse\"). In cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously with denosumab throughout pregnancy starting at gestational day 20 and at a pharmacologically active dose 50-fold higher than the recommended human dose based on body weight, there was increased fetal loss during gestation, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality. Other findings in offspring included absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes; abnormal bone growth, reduced bone strength, reduced hematopoiesis, dental dysplasia, and tooth malalignment; and decreased neonatal growth. At birth out to 1 month of age, infants had measurable blood levels of denosumab (22-621% of maternal levels). Following a recovery period from birth out to 6 months of age, the effects on bone quality and strength returned to normal; there were no adverse effects on tooth eruption, though dental dysplasia was still apparent; axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent, while mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes were present, though small; and minimal to moderate mineralization in multiple tissues was seen in one recovery animal. There was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labor; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labor. Maternal mammary gland development was normal. There was no fetal NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) established for this study because only one dose of 50 mg/kg was evaluated. Mammary gland histopathology at 6 months of age was normal in female offspring exposed to denosumab in utero ; however, development and lactation have not been fully evaluated. In RANKL knockout mice, absence of RANKL (the target of denosumab) also caused fetal lymph node agenesis and led to postnatal impairment of dentition and bone growth. Pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . The no effect dose for denosumab product-induced teratogenicity is unknown. However, a C max of 22.9 ng/mL was identified in cynomolgus monkeys as a level in which no biologic effects (NOEL) of denosumab were observed (no inhibition of RANKL) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of denosumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Denosumab was detected in the maternal milk of cynomolgus monkeys up to 1 month after the last dose of denosumab (\u2264 0.5% milk:serum ratio) and maternal mammary gland development was normal, with no impaired lactation. However, pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animals, denosumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Denosumab-bmwo treatment. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Denosumab-bmwo. Males Denosumab was present at low concentrations (approximately 2% of serum exposure) in the seminal fluid of male subjects given denosumab. Following vaginal intercourse, the maximum amount of denosumab delivered to a female partner would result in exposures approximately 11000 times lower than the prescribed 60 mg subcutaneous dose, and at least 38 times lower than the NOEL in monkeys. Therefore, male condom use would not be necessary as it is unlikely that a female partner or fetus would be exposed to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of denosumab products via seminal fluid [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Denosumab-bmwo have not been established in pediatric patients. In one multicenter, open-label study with denosumab conducted in 153 pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, aged 2 to 17 years, evaluating fracture risk reduction, efficacy was not demonstrated. Hypercalcemia has been reported in pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta treated with denosumab products. Some cases required hospitalization and were complicated by acute renal injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ]. Clinical studies in pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta were terminated early due to the occurrence of life-threatening events and hospitalizations due to hypercalcemia. Safety and effectiveness were not demonstrated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in 24 pediatric patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, aged 5 to 17 years, evaluating change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD Z-score. Based on results from animal studies, denosumab may negatively affect long-bone growth and dentition in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Treatment with denosumab products may impair long-bone growth in children with open growth plates and may inhibit eruption of dentition. In neonatal rats, inhibition of RANKL (the target of denosumab therapy) with a construct of osteoprotegerin bound to Fc (OPG-Fc) at doses \u2264 10 mg/kg was associated with inhibition of bone growth and tooth eruption. Adolescent primates treated with denosumab at doses 10 and 50 times (10 and 50 mg/kg dose) higher than the recommended human dose of 60 mg administered every 6 months, based on body weight (mg/kg), had abnormal growth plates, considered to be consistent with the pharmacological activity of denosumab [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. Cynomolgus monkeys exposed in utero to denosumab exhibited bone abnormalities, an absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes, reduced hematopoiesis, tooth malalignment, and decreased neonatal growth. Some bone abnormalities recovered once exposure was ceased following birth; however, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent 6 months post-birth [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of denosumab, 9943 patients (76%) were \u2265 65 years old, while 3576 (27%) were \u2265 75 years old. Of the patients in the osteoporosis study in men, 133 patients (55%) were \u2265 65 years old, while 39 patients (16%) were \u2265 75 years old. Of the patients in the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis study, 355 patients (47%) were \u2265 65 years old, while 132 patients (17%) were \u2265 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events and fatal cases have been reported postmarketing. In clinical studies, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (i.e., eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), including dialysis-dependent patients, were at greater risk of developing hypocalcemia. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk. Consider the benefits and risks to the patient when administering Denosumab-bmwo to patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Monitor calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium). Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease including dialysis-dependent patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Denosumab products bind to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Denosumab products prevent RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of denosumab resulted in reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days, with maximal reductions occurring by 1 month. CTX levels were below the limit of assay quantitation (0.049 ng/mL) in 39% to 68% of patients 1 to 3 months after dosing of denosumab. At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated from a maximal reduction of \u2265 87% to \u2265 45% (range: 45% to 80%), as serum denosumab levels diminished, reflecting the reversibility of the effects of denosumab on bone remodeling. These effects were sustained with continued treatment. Upon reinitiation, the degree of inhibition of CTX by denosumab was similar to that observed in patients initiating denosumab treatment. Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [P1NP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of denosumab. After discontinuation of denosumab therapy, markers of bone resorption increased to levels 40% to 60% above pretreatment values but returned to baseline levels within 12 months. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a study conducted in healthy male and female volunteers (n = 73, age range: 18 to 64 years) following a single subcutaneously administered denosumab dose of 60 mg, the mean area-under-the-concentration-time curve up to 16 weeks (AUC 0-16 weeks ) of denosumab was 316 mcg\u2219day/mL (SD = 101 mcg\u2219day/mL). The mean maximum denosumab concentration (C max ) was 6.75 mcg/mL (SD = 1.89 mcg/mL). No accumulation or change in denosumab pharmacokinetics with time is observed with multiple dosing of 60 mg subcutaneously administered once every 6 months. Absorption Following subcutaneous administration, the median time to maximum denosumab concentration (Tmax) was 10 days (range: 3 to 21 days). Distribution The mean volume of distribution for denosumab was 5.2 L (SD = 1.7 L). Elimination Serum denosumab concentrations declined over a period of 4 to 5 months with a mean half-life of 25.4 days (SD = 8.5 days; n = 46). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics. This analysis showed no notable differences in pharmacokinetics with age (in postmenopausal women), race, or body weight (36 to 140 kg). Seminal Fluid Pharmacokinetic Study Serum and seminal fluid concentrations of denosumab were measured in 12 healthy male volunteers (age range: 43-65 years). After a single 60 mg subcutaneous administration of denosumab, the mean (\u00b1 SD) C max values in the serum and seminal fluid samples were 6170 (\u00b1 2070) and 100 (\u00b1 81.9) ng/mL, respectively, resulting in a maximum seminal fluid concentration of approximately 2% of serum levels. The median (range) T max values in the serum and seminal fluid samples were 8.0 (7.9 to 21) and 21 (8.0 to 49) days, respectively. Among the subjects, the highest denosumab concentration in seminal fluid was 301 ng/mL at 22 days post-dose. On the first day of measurement (10 days post-dose), nine of eleven subjects had quantifiable concentrations in semen. On the last day of measurement (106 days post-dose), five subjects still had quantifiable concentrations of denosumab in seminal fluid, with a mean (\u00b1 SD) seminal fluid concentration of 21.1 (\u00b1 36.5) ng/mL across all subjects (n = 12). Drug Interactions In a study of 19 postmenopausal women with low BMD and rheumatoid arthritis treated with etanercept (50 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly), a single-dose of denosumab (60 mg subcutaneous injection) was administered 7 days after the previous dose of etanercept. No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of etanercept were observed. Cytochrome P450 substrates In a study of 17 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, midazolam (2 mg oral) was administered 2 weeks after a single-dose of denosumab (60 mg subcutaneous injection), which approximates the T max of denosumab. Denosumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). This indicates that denosumab products should not alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Specific Populations Gender: Mean serum denosumab concentration-time profiles observed in a study conducted in healthy men \u2265 50 years were similar to those observed in a study conducted in postmenopausal women using the same dose regimen. Age: The pharmacokinetics of denosumab were not affected by age across all populations studied whose ages ranged from 28 to 87 years. Race: The pharmacokinetics of denosumab were not affected by race. Renal Impairment: In a study of 55 patients with varying degrees of renal function, including patients on dialysis, the degree of renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab; thus, dose adjustment for renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment: No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab products. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of denosumab or of other denosumab products. Using an electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay, less than 1% (55 out of 8113) of patients treated with denosumab for up to 5 years tested positive for binding antibodies (including pre-existing, transient, and developing antibodies). None of the patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies, as was assessed using a chemiluminescent cell-based in vitro biological assay. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-drug antibodies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of denosumab."

Impairment of Fertility Denosumab had no effect on female fertility or male reproductive organs in monkeys at doses that were 13- to 50-fold higher than the recommended human dose of 60 mg subcutaneously administered once every 6 months, based on body weight (mg/kg). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Denosumab products are inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption via inhibition of RANKL. In ovariectomized monkeys, once-monthly treatment with denosumab suppressed bone turnover and increased BMD and strength of cancellous and cortical bone at doses 50-fold higher than the recommended human dose of 60 mg administered once every 6 months, based on body weight (mg/kg). Bone tissue was normal with no evidence of mineralization defects, accumulation of osteoid, or woven bone. Because the biological activity of denosumab in animals is specific to nonhuman primates, evaluation of genetically engineered (\"knockout\") mice or use of other biological inhibitors of the RANK/RANKL pathway, namely OPG-Fc, provided additional information on the pharmacodynamic properties of denosumab products. RANK/RANKL knockout mice exhibited absence of lymph node formation, as well as an absence of lactation due to inhibition of mammary gland maturation (lobulo-alveolar gland development during pregnancy) . Neonatal RANK/RANKL knockout mice exhibited reduced bone growth and lack of tooth eruption. A corroborative study in 2-week-old rats given the RANKL inhibitor OPG-Fc also showed reduced bone growth, altered growth plates, and impaired tooth eruption.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled women had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease) or on therapies that affect bone were excluded from this study. The 7808 enrolled women were aged 60 to 91 years with a mean age of 72 years. Overall, the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -2.8, and 23% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (N = 3906) or denosumab 60 mg (N = 3902) once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Vertebral fractures were diagnosed based on lateral spine radiographs (T4-L4) using a semiquantitative scoring method. Secondary efficacy variables included the incidence of hip fracture and nonvertebral fracture, assessed at 3 years. Effect on Vertebral Fractures Denosumab significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001), as shown in Table 3. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the denosumab-treated women. The absolute risk reduction was 4.8% and relative risk reduction was 68% for new morphometric vertebral fractures at year 3. Table 3. The Effect of Denosumab on the Incidence of New Vertebral Fractures in Postmenopausal Women Proportion of Women with Fracture (%) Event rates based on crude rates in each interval. Absolute Risk Reduction (%) Absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction based on Mantel-Haenszel method adjusting for age group variable. (95% CI) Relative Risk Reduction (%) (95% CI) Placebo N = 3691 (%) Denosumab N = 3702 (%) 0-1 Year 2.2 0.9 1.4 (0.8, 1.9) 61 (42, 74) 0-2 Years 5.0 1.4 3.5 (2.7, 4.3) 71 (61, 79) 0-3 Years 7.2 2.3 4.8 (3.9, 5.8) 68 (59, 74) Denosumab was effective in reducing the risk for new morphometric vertebral fractures regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, baseline BMD, baseline history of fracture, or prior use of a drug for osteoporosis. Effect on Hip Fractures The incidence of hip fracture was 1.2% for placebo-treated women compared to 0.7% for denosumab-treated women at year 3. The age-adjusted absolute risk reduction of hip fractures was 0.3% with a relative risk reduction of 40% at 3 years (p = 0.04) (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Cumulative Incidence of Hip Fractures Over 3 Years N = number of subjects randomized Chemical Structure Effect on Nonvertebral Fractures Treatment with denosumab resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of nonvertebral fractures (see Table 4).

Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Treatment with denosumab significantly increased BMD at all anatomic sites measured at 3 years. The treatment differences in BMD at 3 years were 8.8% at the lumbar spine, 6.4% at the total hip, and 5.2% at the femoral neck. Consistent effects on BMD were observed at the lumbar spine, regardless of baseline age, race, weight/body mass index (BMI), baseline BMD, and level of bone turnover. After denosumab discontinuation, BMD returned to approximately baseline levels within 12 months. Bone Histology and Histomorphometry A total of 115 transiliac crest bone biopsy specimens were obtained from 92 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at either month 24 and/or month 36 (53 specimens in denosumab group, 62 specimens in placebo group). Of the biopsies obtained, 115 (100%) were adequate for qualitative histology and 7 (6%) were adequate for full quantitative histomorphometry assessment. Qualitative histology assessments showed normal architecture and quality with no evidence of mineralization defects, woven bone, or marrow fibrosis in patients treated with denosumab. The presence of double tetracycline labeling in a biopsy specimen provides an indication of active bone remodeling, while the absence of tetracycline label suggests suppressed bone formation. In patients treated with denosumab, 35% had no tetracycline label present at the month 24 biopsy and 38% had no tetracycline label present at the month 36 biopsy, while 100% of placebo-treated patients had double label present at both time points. When compared to placebo, treatment with denosumab resulted in virtually absent activation frequency and markedly reduced bone formation rates. However, the long-term consequences of this degree of suppression of bone remodeling are unknown. 14.2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis was demonstrated in a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled men had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck. Men with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were also enrolled if there was a history of prior fragility fracture. Men with other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease) or on therapies that may affect bone were excluded from this study. The 242 men enrolled in the study ranged in age from 31 to 84 years with a mean age of 65 years. Men were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo (n = 121) or denosumab 60 mg (n = 121) once every 6 months. All men received at least 1000 mg calcium and at least 800 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to 1-year. Secondary efficacy variables included percent change in total hip, and femoral neck BMD from baseline to 1-year. Treatment with denosumab significantly increased BMD at 1-year. The treatment differences in BMD at 1-year were 4.8% (+0.9% placebo, +5.7% denosumab; (95% CI: 4.0, 5.6); p < 0.0001) at the lumbar spine, 2.0% (+0.3% placebo, +2.4% denosumab) at the total hip, and 2.2% (0.0% placebo, +2.1% denosumab) at femoral neck. Consistent effects on BMD were observed at the lumbar spine regardless of baseline age, race, BMD, testosterone concentrations, and level of bone turnover. Bone Histology and Histomorphometry A total of 29 transiliac crest bone biopsy specimens were obtained from men with osteoporosis at 12 months (17 specimens in denosumab group, 12 specimens in placebo group). Of the biopsies obtained, 29 (100%) were adequate for qualitative histology and, in denosumab patients, 6 (35%) were adequate for full quantitative histomorphometry assessment. Qualitative histology assessments showed normal architecture and quality with no evidence of mineralization defects, woven bone, or marrow fibrosis in patients treated with denosumab. The presence of double tetracycline labeling in a biopsy specimen provides an indication of active bone remodeling, while the absence of tetracycline label suggests suppressed bone formation. In patients treated with denosumab, 6% had no tetracycline label present at the month 12 biopsy, while 100% of placebo-treated patients had double label present. When compared to placebo, treatment with denosumab resulted in markedly reduced bone formation rates. However, the long-term consequences of this degree of suppression of bone remodeling are unknown. 14.3 Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in the 12-month primary analysis of a 2-year, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study (NCT 01575873) of 795 patients (70% women and 30% men) aged 20 to 94 years (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) for < 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation; n = 290) or \u2265 3 months prior to study enrollment and planning to continue treatment for a total of at least 6 months (glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, n = 505). Enrolled patients < 50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Enrolled patients \u2265 50 years of age who were in the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation were required to have a baseline BMD T-score of \u2264 -2.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; or a BMD T-score \u2264 -1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and a history of osteoporotic fracture. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5 mg once daily) (n = 397) or denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Randomization was stratified by gender within each subpopulation. Patients received at least 1000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, denosumab 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9% (p < 0.001). In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, denosumab 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2% (p < 0.001). Consistent effects on lumbar spine BMD were observed regardless of gender; race; geographic region; menopausal status; and baseline age, lumbar spine BMD T-score, and glucocorticoid dose within each subpopulation. Bone Histology Bone biopsy specimens were obtained from 17 patients (11 in the active-control treatment group and 6 in the denosumab treatment group) at Month 12. Of the biopsies obtained, 17 (100%) were adequate for qualitative histology. Qualitative assessments showed bone of normal architecture and quality without mineralization defects or bone marrow abnormality. The presence of double tetracycline labeling in a biopsy specimen provides an indication of active bone remodeling, while the absence of tetracycline label suggests suppressed bone formation. In patients treated with active-control, 100% of biopsies had tetracycline label. In patients treated with denosumab, 1 (33%) had tetracycline label and 2 (67%) had no tetracycline label present at the 12 - month biopsy. Evaluation of full quantitative histomorphometry including bone remodeling rates was not possible in the glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis population treated with denosumab. The long-term consequences of this degree of suppression of bone remodeling in glucocorticoid-treated patients is unknown. 14.4 Treatment of Bone Loss in Men with Prostate Cancer The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of bone loss in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study. Men less than 70 years of age had either a BMD T-score at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck between -1.0 and -4.0, or a history of an osteoporotic fracture. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -0.4, and 22% of men had a vertebral fracture at baseline. The 1468 men enrolled ranged in age from 48 to 97 years (median 76 years). Men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n = 734) or denosumab 60 mg (n = 734) once every 6 months for a total of 6 doses. Randomization was stratified by age (< 70 years vs. \u2265 70 years) and duration of ADT at trial entry (\u2264 6 months vs. > 6 months). Seventy-nine percent of patients received ADT for more than 6 months at study entry. All men received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 24. An additional key secondary efficacy variable was the incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 36 diagnosed based on x-ray evaluation by two independent radiologists. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 2 years in denosumab-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-1.0% placebo, +5.6% denosumab; treatment difference 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2, 7.1); p < 0.0001]. With approximately 62% of patients followed for 3 years, treatment differences in BMD at 3 years were 7.9% (-1.2% placebo, +6.8% denosumab) at the lumbar spine, 5.7% (-2.6% placebo, +3.2% denosumab) at the total hip, and 4.9% (-1.8% placebo, +3.0% denosumab) at the femoral neck. Consistent effects on BMD were observed at the lumbar spine in relevant subgroups defined by baseline age, BMD, and baseline history of vertebral fracture. Effect on Vertebral Fractures Denosumab significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures at 3 years (p = 0.0125), as shown in Table 5. Table 5. The Effect of Denosumab on the Incidence of New Vertebral Fractures in Men with Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer Proportion of Men with Fracture (%) Event rates based on crude rates in each interval. Absolute Risk Reduction (%) Absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction based on Mantel-Haenszel method adjusting for age group and ADT duration variables. (95% CI) Relative Risk Reduction (%) (95% CI) Placebo N = 673 (%) Denosumab N = 679 (%) 0-1 Year 1.9 0.3 1.6 (0.5, 2.8) 85 (33, 97) 0-2 Years 3.3 1.0 2.2 (0.7, 3.8) 69 (27, 86) 0-3 Years 3.9 1.5 2.4 (0.7, 4.1) 62 (22, 81) 14.5 Treatment of Bone Loss in Women with Breast Cancer The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer was assessed in a 2-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study. Women had baseline BMD T-scores between -1.0 to -2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and had not experienced fracture after age 25. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -1.1, and 2.0% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. The 252 women enrolled ranged in age from 35 to 84 years (median 59 years). Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n = 125) or denosumab 60 mg (n = 127) once every 6 months for a total of 4 doses. Randomization was stratified by duration of adjuvant AI therapy at trial entry (\u2264 6 months vs. > 6 months). Sixty-two percent of patients received adjuvant AI therapy for more than 6 months at study entry. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily. Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) The primary efficacy variable was percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline to month 12. Lumbar spine BMD was higher at 12 months in denosumab-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated patients [-0.7% placebo, +4.8% denosumab; treatment difference 5.5% (95% CI: 4.8, 6.3); p < 0.0001]. With approximately 81% of patients followed for 2 years, treatment differences in BMD at 2 years were 7.6% (-1.4% placebo, +6.2% denosumab) at the lumbar spine, 4.7% (-1.0% placebo, +3.8% denosumab) at the total hip, and 3.6% (-0.8% placebo, +2.8% denosumab) at the femoral neck."

If you have advanced chronic kidney disease (may or may not be on kidney dialysis), Denosumab-bmwo may increase your risk for severe low calcium levels in your blood, which could result in hospitalization, life threatening events and death. A mineral and bone disorder associated with kidney disease called chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) may increase your risk for severe low calcium levels in blood. Before you start Denosumab-bmwo and during treatment, your doctor may need to do certain blood tests to check for CKD-MBD. Most people with low blood calcium levels do not have symptoms, but some people may have symptoms. Call your doctor right away if you have symptoms of low blood calcium such as: spasms, twitches, or cramps in your muscles numbness or tingling in your fingers, toes, or around your mouth Serious allergic reactions. Serious allergic reactions have happened in people who take denosumab products.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Denosumab-bmwo should not receive other denosumab products concomitantly. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur. Discontinue permanently if a clinically significant reaction occurs. ( 5.2 ) Hypocalcemia: Denosumab products can cause severe symptomatic hypocalcemia. Fatal cases have been reported with denosumab products use. Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiating Denosumab-bmwo. Monitor calcium levels during therapy, especially in the first weeks of initiating therapy, and adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving denosumab products. Perform an oral examination prior to starting Denosumab-bmwo. Monitor for symptoms. Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with Denosumab-bmwo. ( 5.4 ) Atypical femoral fracture: Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, and manage as clinically appropriate. ( 5.6 , 8.4 ) Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation: When Denosumab-bmwo treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient's risk for vertebral fractures. ( 5.7 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Patients receiving Denosumab-bmwo should not receive other denosumab products concomitantly. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with use of denosumab products. Reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, upper airway edema, lip swelling, rash, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue Denosumab-bmwo therapy permanently [see Contraindications (4.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.3 Hypocalcemia Denosumab products can cause severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported. Correct pre-existing hypocalcemia prior to Denosumab-bmwo treatment. Monitor calcium levels, throughout Denosumab-bmwo therapy, especially in the first weeks of initiating therapy, and administer calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D as necessary. Concomitant use of calcimimetics and other drugs that can lower calcium levels may worsen hypocalcemia risk and serum calcium should be closely monitored. Advise patients to contact a healthcare provider for symptoms of hypocalcemia [see Contraindications (4.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. An increased risk of hypocalcemia has been observed in clinical trials of patients with increasing renal dysfunction, most commonly with severe dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min and/or on dialysis), and with inadequate/no calcium supplementation. Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving denosumab products, manifesting as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration, or gingival erosion. Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be manifestations of ONJ. In clinical trials in patients with cancer, the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Seventy-nine percent of patients with ONJ had a history of tooth extraction, poor oral hygiene, or use of a dental appliance as a predisposing factor. Other risk factors for the development of ONJ include immunosuppressive therapy, treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, diabetes, and gingival infections. Similarly, for denosumab-treated patients with multiple myeloma that developed ONJ, 58% had a history of invasive dental procedures as a predisposing factor. Perform an oral examination and appropriate preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of Denosumab-bmwo and periodically during Denosumab-bmwo therapy. Advise patients regarding oral hygiene practices. Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with Denosumab-bmwo. Consider temporary discontinuation of Denosumab-bmwo therapy if an invasive dental procedure must be performed. There are no data available to suggest the optimal duration of treatment interruption. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Denosumab-bmwo should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Clinical judgment of the treating healthcare provider should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual risk/benefit assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. During Denosumab-bmwo treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Denosumab-bmwo therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons Clinically significant hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization and complicated by acute renal injury has been reported in denosumab product-treated patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with growing skeletons. Hypercalcemia has been reported within the first year after treatment discontinuation. After treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, assess serum calcium periodically, reevaluate the patient's calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements and manage patients as clinically appropriate [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.7 Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation Multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) have been reported following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab products. Patients at higher risk for MVF include those with risk factors for or a history of osteoporosis or prior fractures. When Denosumab-bmwo treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient's risk for vertebral fractures [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, denosumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of denosumab to cynomolgus monkeys throughout pregnancy at a dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of denosumab based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality, along with evidence of absent peripheral lymph nodes, abnormal bone growth and decreased neonatal growth. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Denosumab-bmwo. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Denosumab-bmwo during pregnancy or within 5 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Denosumab-bmwo [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] ."

Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors The safety of denosumab was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials [see Clinical Trials (14.1) ] in which a total of 2841 patients with bone metastasis from prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors, or lytic bony lesions from multiple myeloma received at least one dose of denosumab. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, patients were randomized to receive either 120 mg of denosumab every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection or 4 mg (dose adjusted for reduced renal function) of zoledronic acid every 4 weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion. Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5 mg/dL (2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater. Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure. During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. The median duration of exposure to denosumab was 12 months (range: 0.1-41) and median duration on-study was 13 months (range: 0.1-41). Of patients who received denosumab, 46% were female. Eighty-five percent were White, 5% Hispanic/Latino, 6% Asian, and 3% Black. The median age was 63 years (range: 18-93). Seventy-five percent of patients who received denosumab received concomitant chemotherapy. The most common adverse reactions in patients (incidence greater than or equal to 25%) were fatigue/asthenia, hypophosphatemia, and nausea (see Table 1 ). The most common serious adverse reaction was dyspnea. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of denosumab were osteonecrosis and hypocalcemia. Table 1. Selected Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients receiving denosumab in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, and meeting one of the following criteria: At least 1% greater incidence in denosumab-treated patients, or Between-group difference (either direction) of less than 1% and more than 5% greater incidence in patients treated with zoledronic acid compared to placebo (US Prescribing Information for zoledronic acid) Adverse Reactions of Any Severity (Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103) Body System Denosumab n = 2841 % Zoledronic Acid n = 2836 % GASTROINTESTINAL Nausea 31 32 Diarrhea 20 19 GENERAL Fatigue/Asthenia 45 46 INVESTIGATIONS Hypocalcemia Laboratory-derived and below the central laboratory lower limit of normal [8.3 - 8.5 mg/dL (2.075 - 2.125 mmol/L) for calcium and 2.2 - 2.8 mg/dL (0.71 - 0.9 mmol/L) for phosphorus] 18 9 Hypophosphatemia 32 20 NEUROLOGICAL Headache 13 14 RESPIRATORY Dyspnea 21 18 Cough 15 15 Severe Mineral/Electrolyte Abnormalities Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7 mg/dL or less than 1.75 mmol/L) occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with denosumab and 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Of patients who experienced severe hypocalcemia, 33% experienced 2 or more episodes of severe hypocalcemia and 16% experienced 3 or more episodes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL or less than 0.6 mmol/L) occurred in 15% of patients treated with denosumab and 7% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the primary treatment phases of Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients in the denosumab group (median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1-41) and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group. The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included a denosumab open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered denosumab 120 mg once every 4 weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1-67.2). The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months (range: 4-53) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating denosumab for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which denosumab is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3% in the second year, and 7% per year thereafter. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture In the clinical trial program, atypical femoral fracture has been reported in patients treated with denosumab and the risk increased with longer duration of treatment. Events have occurred during treatment and after treatment was discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Multiple Myeloma The safety of denosumab was evaluated in an international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled trial of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with treatment through disease progression [see Clinical Trials (14.2) ] . In this trial, patients received 120 mg denosumab every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection (n = 850) or 4 mg (dose adjusted for renal function) of zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks by IV infusion (n = 852). Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5 mg/dL (2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater. Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure. During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. The median duration of exposure to denosumab was 16 months (range: 1-50) and median duration on-study was 17 months (range: 0-49). Of patients who received denosumab, 46% were female, 83% were White, 13% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 4% Hispanic/Latino. The median age of the patients randomized to denosumab was 63 years (range: 29-91) and all patients who received denosumab received concomitant anti-myeloma chemotherapy. The adverse reaction profile of denosumab in patients with multiple myeloma, Study 20090482, was similar to that observed in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) were diarrhea (34%), nausea (32%), anemia (22%), back pain (21%), thrombocytopenia (19%), peripheral edema (17%), hypocalcemia (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (15%), rash (14%), and headache (11%). The most common serious adverse reaction (incidence \u2265 5%) was pneumonia (8%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of denosumab (\u2265 1%) was osteonecrosis of the jaw. Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7 mg/dL or less than 1.75 mmol/L) and severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL or less than 0.6 mmol/L) occurred in 2% and 21% patients treated with denosumab, respectively. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the primary treatment phase of Study 20090482, ONJ was confirmed in 4.1% of patients in the denosumab group (median exposure of 16 months; range: 1-50) and 2.8% of patients in the zoledronic acid group (median 15 months, range: 1-45 months). At the completion of the double-blind treatment phase of Study 20090482, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ in the denosumab group (median exposure of 19.4 months; range: 1-52) was 2% during the first year of treatment, 5% in the second year, and 4.5% per year thereafter. The median time to ONJ was 18.7 months (range: 1-44) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Giant Cell Tumor of Bone The safety of denosumab was evaluated in two single-arm trials (Study 20062004 and Study 20040215) [see Clinical Trials (14.3) ] in which a total of 548 adult or skeletally mature adolescent patients with giant cell tumor of bone received at least 1 dose of denosumab. Patients received 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy. Patients receiving concurrent bisphosphonate therapy were excluded from enrollment in both studies. Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure were excluded from enrollment in Study 20040215. During the trial, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. Of the 548 patients who received denosumab, 467 patients were treated with denosumab for \u2265 1 year, 323 patients for \u2265 2 years, and 255 patients for \u2265 3 years. The median number of doses received was 33 (range: 4-138 doses) and the median number of months on-study was 60 (range: 0-140 months). Fifty-seven percent of the enrolled patients were women and 82% were White. The median age was 33 years (range: 13-83 years); a total of 19 patients were skeletally mature adolescents (12 to <17 years of age). The common adverse reaction profile of denosumab in patients with giant cell tumor of bone was generally similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103. The most common adverse reactions in patients (incidence \u2265 10%) were arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, fatigue, headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, musculoskeletal pain, toothache, vomiting, hypophosphatemia, constipation, diarrhea, and cough. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were osteonecrosis of the jaw (3.6%), bone giant cell tumor (1.5%), anemia (1.1%), pneumonia (0.9%), and back pain (0.9%). The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of denosumab was osteonecrosis of the jaw (incidence of 3.6%). The adverse reaction profile appeared similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults. Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia Moderate to severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 8 mg/dL or less than 2 mmol/L) occurred in 5% of patients treated with denosumab. Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 to 1 mg/dL or less than 0.6 to 0.3 mmol/L) occurred in 20% of patients treated with denosumab. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the pooled analysis of Study 20062004 and Study 20040215, ONJ was confirmed in 7% of patients who received denosumab (median number of doses received: 33; range: 4-138 doses). Study 20140114 (NCT03301857) was a 5-year long term follow-up study for patients (n = 85) who completed Study 20062004. In Study 20062004 and Study 20140114 combined, ONJ was confirmed in 7% of patients who received denosumab (median time on trial 62.2 months (range 0 - 173). The combined patient year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 0.2% during the first year of treatment, 1.5% in the second year, 1.8% in the third year, 2.1% in the fourth year, 1.4% in the fifth year, and 1.5% thereafter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture In the pooled analysis of Study 20062004 and Study 20040215, atypical femoral fracture was observed in 0.9% of patients who received denosumab (median number of doses received: 33; range: 4-138 doses). In Study 20062004 and Study 20140114, the combined incidence of confirmed atypical femoral fracture was 1.3% of patients who received denosumab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation In the pooled safety population, 0.7% of patients experienced serious adverse events of hypercalcemia > 30 days following treatment discontinuation that was recurrent in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Denosumab was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (Study 20070315) in which 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (with or without bone metastases) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled [see Clinical Trials (14.4) ] . The adverse reaction profile of denosumab in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy was similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, 20050103, 20062004, and 20040215. Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20% of patients were nausea (30%), dyspnea (27%), decreased appetite (24%), headache (24%), peripheral edema (24%), vomiting (24%), anemia (21%), constipation (21%), and diarrhea (21%). The following adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity related to study therapy were reported on-study: fatigue (3%) and infection (6%). Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesemia (3%), hypokalemia (3%), and hypophosphatemia (76%) of patients. No deaths on-study were related to denosumab therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of denosumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypocalcemia: Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, including fatal cases [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Hypercalcemia: Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation can occur [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions [see Contraindications (4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Musculoskeletal pain, including severe musculoskeletal pain. Positive re-challenge has been reported. Lichenoid drug eruptions (e.g., lichen planus-like reactions). Alopecia."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric patients: Recommended only for treatment of skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone. ( 8.4 ) Renal impairment: Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or receiving dialysis are at risk for hypocalcemia. Adequately supplement with calcium and vitamin D. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, denosumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are insufficient data with denosumab products use in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes. In utero denosumab exposure from cynomolgus monkeys dosed monthly with denosumab throughout pregnancy at a dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of denosumab based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality; and absent lymph nodes, abnormal bone growth, and decreased neonatal growth [see Data ] . Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The effects of denosumab on prenatal development have been studied in both cynomolgus monkeys and genetically engineered mice in which RANK ligand (RANKL) expression was turned off by gene removal (a \"knockout mouse\"). In cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously with denosumab throughout pregnancy starting at gestational day 20 and at a pharmacologically active dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of denosumab based on body weight, there was increased fetal loss during gestation, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality. Other findings in offspring included absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes; abnormal bone growth, reduced bone strength, reduced hematopoiesis, dental dysplasia, and tooth malalignment; and decreased neonatal growth. At birth out to one month of age, infants had measurable blood levels of denosumab (22-621% of maternal levels). Following a recovery period from birth out to 6 months of age, the effects on bone quality and strength returned to normal; there were no adverse effects on tooth eruption, though dental dysplasia was still apparent; axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent, while mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes were present, though small; and minimal to moderate mineralization in multiple tissues was seen in one recovery animal. There was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labor; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labor. Maternal mammary gland development was normal. There was no fetal NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) established for this study because only one dose of 50 mg/kg was evaluated. Mammary gland histopathology at 6 months of age was normal in female offspring exposed to denosumab in utero ; however, development and lactation have not been fully evaluated. In RANKL knockout mice, absence of RANKL (the target of denosumab) also caused fetal lymph node agenesis and led to postnatal impairment of dentition and bone growth. Pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of denosumab products in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Denosumab was detected in the maternal milk of cynomolgus monkeys up to 1 month after the last dose of denosumab (\u2264 0.5% milk:serum ratio) and maternal mammary gland development was normal, with no impaired lactation. However, pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] . Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for Denosumab-bmwo treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Denosumab-bmwo or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, denosumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Denosumab-bmwo treatment. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Denosumab-bmwo. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Denosumab-bmwo have not been established in pediatric patients except in skeletally mature adolescents (aged 12-16 years) with giant cell tumor of bone. Denosumab-bmwo is recommended only for treatment of skeletally mature adolescents (aged 12-16 years) with giant cell tumor of bone [see Indications and Usage (1.2) ]. Clinically significant hypercalcemia after treatment discontinuation has been reported in pediatric patients with growing skeletons who received denosumab products for giant cell tumor of bone or for unapproved indications [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Denosumab was studied in an open-label trial that enrolled a subset of 19 adolescent patients (aged 12-16 years) with giant cell tumor of bone who had reached skeletal maturity, defined by at least 1 mature long bone (e.g., closed epiphyseal growth plate of the humerus), and had a body weight \u2265 45 kg [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and Clinical Trials (14.3) ]. A total of one of five (20%) evaluable adolescent patients had an objective response by retrospective independent assessment of radiographic response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). The adverse reaction profile and efficacy results appeared to be similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Trials (14.3) ] . Animal Data Treatment with denosumab products may impair bone growth in children with open growth plates and may inhibit eruption of dentition. In neonatal rats, inhibition of RANKL (the target of denosumab therapy) with a construct of osteoprotegerin bound to Fc (OPG-Fc) at doses \u2264 10 mg/kg was associated with inhibition of bone growth and tooth eruption. Adolescent primates treated with denosumab at doses 5 and 25 times (10 and 50 mg/kg dose) higher than the recommended human dose of 120 mg administered once every 4 weeks, based on body weight (mg/kg), had abnormal growth plates, considered to be consistent with the pharmacological activity of denosumab. Cynomolgus monkeys exposed in utero to denosumab exhibited bone abnormalities, reduced hematopoiesis, tooth malalignment, decreased neonatal growth, and an absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Some bone abnormalities recovered once exposure was ceased following birth; however, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent 6 months post-birth [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies that received denosumab (n = 2841) in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, 1271 (44%) were \u2265 65 years old, while 473 patients (17%) were \u2265 75 years old. Of the 859 patients in Study 20090482 that received denosumab, 387 patients (45%) were \u2265 65 years old, while 141 patients (16%) were \u2265 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment Two clinical trials were conducted in patients without cancer and with varying degrees of renal function. In one study, patients (N = 55) with varying degrees of renal function (ranging from normal through end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis) received a single 60 mg subcutaneous dose of denosumab. In a second study, patients (N = 32) with severe renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min and/or on dialysis) were given two 120 mg subcutaneous doses of denosumab. In both studies, greater risk of developing hypocalcemia was observed with increasing renal impairment, and with inadequate/no calcium supplementation. Hypocalcemia was mild to moderate in severity in 96% of patients. Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, denosumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . There are insufficient data with denosumab products use in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes. In utero denosumab exposure from cynomolgus monkeys dosed monthly with denosumab throughout pregnancy at a dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of denosumab based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality; and absent lymph nodes, abnormal bone growth, and decreased neonatal growth [see Data ] . Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The effects of denosumab on prenatal development have been studied in both cynomolgus monkeys and genetically engineered mice in which RANK ligand (RANKL) expression was turned off by gene removal (a \"knockout mouse\"). In cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously with denosumab throughout pregnancy starting at gestational day 20 and at a pharmacologically active dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of denosumab based on body weight, there was increased fetal loss during gestation, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality. Other findings in offspring included absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes; abnormal bone growth, reduced bone strength, reduced hematopoiesis, dental dysplasia, and tooth malalignment; and decreased neonatal growth. At birth out to one month of age, infants had measurable blood levels of denosumab (22-621% of maternal levels). Following a recovery period from birth out to 6 months of age, the effects on bone quality and strength returned to normal; there were no adverse effects on tooth eruption, though dental dysplasia was still apparent; axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent, while mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes were present, though small; and minimal to moderate mineralization in multiple tissues was seen in one recovery animal. There was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labor; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labor. Maternal mammary gland development was normal. There was no fetal NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) established for this study because only one dose of 50 mg/kg was evaluated. Mammary gland histopathology at 6 months of age was normal in female offspring exposed to denosumab in utero ; however, development and lactation have not been fully evaluated. In RANKL knockout mice, absence of RANKL (the target of denosumab) also caused fetal lymph node agenesis and led to postnatal impairment of dentition and bone growth. Pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Denosumab-bmwo have not been established in pediatric patients except in skeletally mature adolescents (aged 12-16 years) with giant cell tumor of bone. Denosumab-bmwo is recommended only for treatment of skeletally mature adolescents (aged 12-16 years) with giant cell tumor of bone [see Indications and Usage (1.2) ]. Clinically significant hypercalcemia after treatment discontinuation has been reported in pediatric patients with growing skeletons who received denosumab products for giant cell tumor of bone or for unapproved indications [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Denosumab was studied in an open-label trial that enrolled a subset of 19 adolescent patients (aged 12-16 years) with giant cell tumor of bone who had reached skeletal maturity, defined by at least 1 mature long bone (e.g., closed epiphyseal growth plate of the humerus), and had a body weight \u2265 45 kg [see Indications and Usage (1.2) and Clinical Trials (14.3) ]. A total of one of five (20%) evaluable adolescent patients had an objective response by retrospective independent assessment of radiographic response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). The adverse reaction profile and efficacy results appeared to be similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Trials (14.3) ] . Animal Data Treatment with denosumab products may impair bone growth in children with open growth plates and may inhibit eruption of dentition. In neonatal rats, inhibition of RANKL (the target of denosumab therapy) with a construct of osteoprotegerin bound to Fc (OPG-Fc) at doses \u2264 10 mg/kg was associated with inhibition of bone growth and tooth eruption. Adolescent primates treated with denosumab at doses 5 and 25 times (10 and 50 mg/kg dose) higher than the recommended human dose of 120 mg administered once every 4 weeks, based on body weight (mg/kg), had abnormal growth plates, considered to be consistent with the pharmacological activity of denosumab. Cynomolgus monkeys exposed in utero to denosumab exhibited bone abnormalities, reduced hematopoiesis, tooth malalignment, decreased neonatal growth, and an absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Some bone abnormalities recovered once exposure was ceased following birth; however, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent 6 months post-birth [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Denosumab products bind to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption, thereby modulating calcium release from bone. Increased osteoclast activity, stimulated by RANKL, is a mediator of bone pathology in solid tumors with osseous metastases. Similarly, giant cell tumors of bone consist of stromal cells expressing RANKL and osteoclast-like giant cells expressing RANK receptor, and signaling through the RANK receptor contributes to osteolysis and tumor growth. Denosumab products prevent RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts, their precursors, and osteoclast-like giant cells. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with breast cancer and bone metastases, the median reduction in uNTx/Cr was 82% within 1 week following initiation of denosumab 120 mg administered subcutaneously. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, the median reduction in uNTx/Cr from baseline to Month 3 was approximately 80% in 2075 denosumab-treated patients. In a phase 3 study of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who received subcutaneous doses of denosumab 120 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), median reductions in uNTx/Cr of approximately 75% were observed by week 5. Reductions in bone turnover markers were maintained, with median reductions of 74% to 79% for uNTx/Cr from weeks 9 to 49 of continued 120 mg Q4W dosing. In adult and skeletally mature adolescent patients with giant cell tumor of bone who received subcutaneous doses of denosumab 120 mg Q4W with a 120 mg loading dose on Days 8 and 15, median reductions in uNTx/Cr from baseline were 84% at Week 13 and 82% at Week 25. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following subcutaneous administration, bioavailability was 62%. Denosumab displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetics at doses below 60 mg, but approximately dose-proportional increases in exposure at higher doses. With multiple subcutaneous doses of 120 mg once every 4 weeks, up to 2.8-fold accumulation in serum denosumab concentrations was observed and steady-state was achieved by 6 months. A mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) serum steady-state trough concentration of 20.5 (\u00b1 13.5) mcg/mL was achieved by 6 months. The mean elimination half-life was 28 days. In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who received 120 mg every 4 weeks, denosumab concentrations appear to reach steady-state by month 6. In patients with giant cell tumor of bone, after administration of subcutaneous doses of 120 mg once every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy, mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) serum trough concentrations on Day 8, 15, and one month after the first dose were 19.0 (\u00b1 24.1), 31.6 (\u00b1 27.3), 36.4 (\u00b1 20.6) mcg/mL, respectively. Steady-state was achieved in 3 months after initiation of treatment with a mean serum trough concentration of 23.4 (\u00b1 12.1) mcg/mL. Special Populations Body Weight: A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics. Denosumab clearance and volume of distribution were proportional to body weight. The steady-state exposure following repeat subcutaneous administration of 120 mg every 4 weeks to 45 kg and 120 kg subjects were, respectively, 48% higher and 46% lower than exposure of the typical 66 kg subject. Age, Gender and Race: The pharmacokinetics of denosumab was not affected by age, gender, and race. Pediatrics: In skeletally-mature adolescent patients (12 to 16 years of age) with giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) who received 120 mg every 4 weeks with a 120 mg loading dose on Days 8 and 15, the pharmacokinetics of denosumab were comparable to those observed in adult patients with GCTB. Hepatic Impairment: No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab products. Renal Impairment: In clinical trials of 87 patients with varying degrees of renal dysfunction, including patients on dialysis, the degree of renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of denosumab [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction trials have been conducted with denosumab. There was no evidence that various anticancer treatments affected denosumab systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic effect. Serum denosumab concentrations at 1 and 3 months and reductions in the bone turnover marker uNTx/Cr (urinary N-terminal telopeptide corrected for creatinine) at 3 months were similar in patients with and without prior intravenous bisphosphonate therapy and were not altered by concomitant chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of denosumab or of other denosumab products. Using an electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay, less than 1% (55 out of 8113) of patients treated with denosumab for up to 5 years tested positive for binding antibodies (including pre-existing, transient, and developing antibodies). None of the patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies, as was assessed using a chemiluminescent cell-based in vitro biological assay. There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-drug antibodies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of denosumab."

      "14 CLINICAL TRIALS 14.1 Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors The safety and efficacy of denosumab for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors was demonstrated in three international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trials comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid. In all three trials, patients were randomized to receive 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks (dose adjusted for reduced renal function). Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min were excluded. In each trial, the main outcome measure was demonstration of noninferiority of time to first skeletal-related event (SRE) as compared to zoledronic acid. Supportive outcome measures were superiority of time to first SRE and superiority of time to first and subsequent SRE; testing for these outcome measures occurred if the main outcome measure was statistically significant. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. Study 20050136 ( NCT00321464 ) enrolled 2046 patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE (yes or no), receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization (yes or no), prior oral bisphosphonate use (yes or no), and region (Japan or other countries). Forty percent of patients had a previous SRE, 40% received chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization, 5% received prior oral bisphosphonates, and 7% were enrolled from Japan. Median age was 57 years, 80% of patients were White, and 99% of patients were women. The median number of doses administered was 18 for denosumab and 17 for zoledronic acid. Study 20050244 ( NCT00330759 ) enrolled 1776 adults with solid tumors other than breast and castrate-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis and multiple myeloma. Randomization was stratified by previous SRE (yes or no), systemic anticancer therapy at time of randomization (yes or no), and tumor type (non-small cell lung cancer, myeloma, or other). Eighty-seven percent were receiving systemic anticancer therapy at the time of randomization, 52% had a previous SRE, 64% of patients were men, 87% were White, and the median age was 60 years. A total of 40% of patients had non-small cell lung cancer, 10% had multiple myeloma, 9% had renal cell carcinoma, and 6% had small cell lung cancer. Other tumor types each comprised less than 5% of the enrolled population. The median number of doses administered was 7 for both denosumab and zoledronic acid. Study 20050103 ( NCT00321620 ) enrolled 1901 men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastasis. Randomization was stratified by previous SRE, PSA level (less than 10 ng/mL or 10 ng/mL or greater) and receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization (yes or no). Twenty-six percent of patients had a previous SRE, 15% of patients had PSA less than 10 ng/mL, and 14% received chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization. Median age was 71 years and 86% of patients were White. The median number of doses administered was 13 for denosumab and 11 for zoledronic acid. Denosumab delayed the time to first SRE following randomization as compared to zoledronic acid in patients with breast or castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with osseous metastases (Table 2). In patients with bone metastasis due to other solid tumors or lytic lesions due to multiple myeloma, denosumab was noninferior to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first SRE following randomization. Overall survival and progression-free survival were similar between arms in all three trials. Table 2.

In this trial, patients were randomized to receive 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks (dose adjusted for reduced renal function). Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min were excluded. In this trial, the main efficacy outcome measure was noninferiority of time to first skeletal-related event (SRE). Additional efficacy outcome measures were superiority of time to first SRE, time to first and subsequent SRE, and overall survival. An SRE was defined as any of the following: pathologic fracture, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression. Study 20090482 enrolled 1718 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with bone lesions. Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE (yes or no), the anti-myeloma agent being utilized/planned to be utilized in first-line therapy (novel therapy-based or non-novel therapy-based [novel therapies include bortezomib, lenalidomide, or thalidomide]), intent to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation (yes or no), stage at diagnosis (International Staging System I or II or III) and region Japan (yes or no). At study enrollment, 96% of the patients were receiving or planning to receive novel therapy-based first-line anti-myeloma therapy, 55% of the patients intended to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation, 61% of patients had a previous SRE, 32% were at ISS stage I, 38% were at ISS stage II and 29% were at ISS Stage III, and 2% were enrolled from Japan. Median age was 63 years, 82% of patients were White, and 46% of patients were women. The median number of doses administered was 16 for denosumab and 15 for zoledronic acid. Denosumab was noninferior to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first SRE following randomization (HR = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.85-1.14). The results for overall survival (OS) were comparable between denosumab and zoledronic acid treatment groups with a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.16). Table 3.

Patients received 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks with a loading dose on Days 8 and 15 of the first cycle of therapy. Patients who discontinued denosumab then entered the safety follow-up phase for a minimum of 60 months. Retreatment with denosumab while in safety follow-up was allowed for patients who initially demonstrated a response to denosumab (e.g., in the case of recurrent disease). Study 20040215 was a single-arm, pharmacodynamic, and proof of concept trial conducted in 37 adult patients with unresectable or recurrent giant cell tumor of bone. Patients were required to have histologically confirmed giant cell tumor of bone and radiologic evidence of measurable disease from a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained within 28 days prior to study enrollment. Patients enrolled in Study 20040215 underwent CT or MRI assessment of giant cell tumor of bone at baseline and quarterly during denosumab treatment. Study 20062004 was a parallel-cohort, proof of concept, and safety trial conducted in 535 adult or skeletally mature adolescent patients with histologically confirmed giant cell tumor of bone and evidence of measurable active disease. Study 20062004 enrolled 19 patients who were 12-16 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Patients enrolled into one of three cohorts: Cohort 1 enrolled 268 patients with surgically unsalvageable disease (e.g., sacral or spinal sites of disease, or pulmonary metastases); Cohort 2 enrolled 252 patients with surgically salvageable disease where the investigator determined that the planned surgery was likely to result in severe morbidity (e.g., joint resection, limb amputation, or hemipelvectomy); Cohort 3 enrolled 15 patients who previously participated in Study 20040215. Patients underwent imaging assessment of disease status at intervals determined by their treating physician. A retrospective interim analysis concluded by an independent review committee evaluated objective response in 187 patients enrolled and treated in Study 20040215 and Study 20062004 for whom baseline and at least one post-baseline radiographic assessment were available (27 of 37 patients enrolled in Study 20040215 and 160 of 270 patients enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2 of Study 20062004). The primary efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1. The overall objective response rate (RECIST 1.1) was 25% (95% CI: 19, 32). All responses were partial responses. The estimated median time to response was 3 months. In the 47 patients with an objective response, the median duration of follow-up was 20 months (range: 2-44 months), and 51% (24/47) had a duration of response lasting at least 8 months. Three patients experienced disease progression following an objective response. 14.4 Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety and efficacy of denosumab was demonstrated in an open-label, single-arm trial [Study 20070315 ( NCT00896454 )] that enrolled 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (with or without bone metastases) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. Patients received denosumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy. In this trial, refractory hypercalcemia of malignancy was defined as an albumin-corrected calcium of > 12.5 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L) despite treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy in 7-30 days prior to initiation of denosumab therapy. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving a response, defined as corrected serum calcium (CSC) \u2264 11.5 mg/dL (2.9 mmol/L), within 10 days after denosumab administration. Efficacy data are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 4. Concurrent chemotherapy did not appear to affect response to denosumab. Figure 1.

Median time to complete response (CSC \u2264 10.8 mg/dL) was 23 days (95% CI: 9, 36), and the median duration of complete response was 34 days (95% CI: 1, 134). Figure 1"
