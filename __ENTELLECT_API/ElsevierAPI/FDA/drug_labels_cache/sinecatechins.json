      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 3 clinical trials, a total of 397 subjects received Veregen three times per day topical application for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts for up to 16 weeks. Serious local adverse events of pain and inflammation were reported in two subjects (0.5%), both women. In clinical trials, the incidence of patients with local adverse events leading to discontinuation or dose interruption (reduction) was 5% (19/397). These included the following events: application site reactions (local pain, erythema, vesicles, skin erosion/ulceration), phimosis, inguinal lymphadenitis, urethral meatal stenosis, dysuria, genital herpes simplex, vulvitis, hypersensitivity, pruritus, pyodermitis, skin ulcer, erosions in the urethral meatus, and superinfection of warts and ulcers. Local and regional reactions (including adenopathy) occurring at >1% in the treated groups are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Local and Regional Adverse Reactions During Treatment (% Subjects) Veregen \u00ae (N = 397) Vehicle (N = 207) Erythema 70 32 Pruritus 69 45 Burning 67 31 Pain/discomfort 56 14 Erosion/Ulceration 49 10 Edema 45 11 Induration 35 11 Rash vesicular 20 6 Regional Lymphadenitis 3 1 Desquamation 5 <1 Discharge 3 <1 Bleeding 2 <1 Reaction 2 0 Scar 1 0 Irritation 1 0 Rash 1 0 A total of 266/397 (67%) of subjects in the Veregen group had either a moderate or a severe reaction that was considered probably related to the drug, of which 120 (30%) subjects had a severe reaction. Severe reactions occurred in 37% (71/192) of women and in 24% (49/205) of men. The percentage of subjects with at least one severe, related adverse event was 26% (86/328) for subjects with genital warts only, 42% (19/45) in subjects with both genital and perianal warts and 48% (11/23) of subjects with perianal warts only. Phimosis occurred in 3% of uncircumcised male subjects (5/174) treated with Veregen and in 1% (1/99) in vehicle. The maximum mean severity of erythema, erosion, edema, and induration was observed by week 2 of treatment. Less common local adverse events included urethritis, perianal infection, pigmentation changes, dryness, eczema, hyperesthesia, necrosis, papules, and discoloration. Other less common adverse events included cervical dysplasia, pelvic pain, cutaneous facial rash, and staphylococcemia. In a dermal sensitization study of Veregen in healthy volunteers, hypersensitivity (type IV) was observed in 5 out of 209 subjects (2.4%) under occlusive conditions. Most common adverse reactions are local skin and application site reactions including (incidence \u2265 20%) erythema, pruritus, burning, pain/discomfort, erosion/ulceration, edema, induration, and rash vesicular (6) .

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Veregen use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, sinecatechins did not cause malformations, but did affect the developing fetus in the presence of maternal toxicity when given to pregnant rabbits and rats by intravaginal or systemic routes of administration during the period of organogenesis ( see Data ). The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of sinecatechins observed in the animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of Veregen. Data Embryo-fetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits using intravaginal and systemic routes of administration, respectively. Oral administration of sinecatechins during the period of organogenesis (gestational Days 6 to 15 in rats or 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause treatment-related malformations or effects on embryo-fetal development at doses of up to 1,000 mg/kg/day. In the presence of maternal toxicity (characterized by marked local irritation at the administration sites and decreased body weight and food consumption) in pregnant female rabbits, subcutaneous doses of 12 and 36 mg/kg/day of sinecatechins during the period of organogenesis (gestational Days 6 to 19) resulted in corresponding influences on fetal development including reduced fetal body weights and delays in skeletal ossification. No treatment-related effects on embryo-fetal development were noted at 4 mg/kg/day. No malformations were noted at any of the doses evaluated in this study. A combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study using daily vaginal administration of Veregen to rats from Day 4 before mating and throughout mating until Day 17 of gestation did not show treatment-related effects on fertility, malformations, or embryo-fetal development at doses up to 0.15 mL/rat/day. This dose corresponds to approximately 150 mg/rat/day. A pre- and post-natal development study was conducted in rats using vaginal administration of Veregen at doses of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 mL/rat/day from Day 6 of gestation through parturition and lactation. The high and intermediate dose levels of 0.15 and 0.10 mL/rat/day resulted in an increased mortality of the F 0 dams, associated with indications of parturition complications. The high dose level of 0.15 mL/rat/day also resulted in an increased incidence of stillbirths. There were no other treatment-related effects on pre- and post-natal development, growth, reproduction and fertility at any dose tested. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of sinecatechins in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. After topical application, Veregen concentrations in plasma are low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be low [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Veregen and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Veregen or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Seven patients (1.4%), older than 65 years of age were treated with Veregen in clinical studies. This, however, is an insufficient number of subjects to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

    "description": [
      "11 DESCRIPTION Veregen (sinecatechins) Ointment, 15% is a botanical drug product for topical use. The drug substance in Veregen is sinecatechins, which is a partially purified fraction of the water extract of green tea leaves from Camellia sinensis (L.) O Kuntze , and is a mixture of catechins and other green tea components. Catechins constitute 85 to 95% (by weight) of the total drug substance which includes more than 55% of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), other catechin derivatives such as Epicatechin (EC), Epigallocatechin (EGC), Epicatechin gallate (ECg), and some additional minor catechin derivatives i.e. Gallocatechin gallate (GCg), Gallocatechin (GC), Catechin gallate (Cg), and Catechin (C). In addition to the known catechin components, it also contains gallic acid, caffeine, and theobromine which together constitute about 2.5% of the drug substance. The remaining amount of the drug substance contains undefined botanical constituents derived from green tea leaves. The structural formulae of catechins are shown below. General Structure of Catechins Each gram of the ointment contains 150 mg of sinecatechins in a water free ointment base consisting of isopropyl myristate, white petrolatum, cera alba (white wax), propylene glycol palmitostearate, and oleyl alcohol.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials were performed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Veregen in the treatment of immunocompetent subjects 18 years of age and older with external genital and perianal warts. The subjects applied the ointment 3 times daily for up to 16 weeks or until complete clearance of all warts (baseline and new warts occurring during treatment). Over both trials the median baseline wart area was 51 mm 2 (range 12 to 585 mm 2 ), and the median baseline number of warts was 6 (range 2 to 30). The primary efficacy outcome measure was the response rate defined as the proportion of subjects with complete clinical (visual) clearance of all external genital and perianal warts (baseline and new) by week 16, presented in Tables 2 and 3 for all randomized subjects dispensed medication.
