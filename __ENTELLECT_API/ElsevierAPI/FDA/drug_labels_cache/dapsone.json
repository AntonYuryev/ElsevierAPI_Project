      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae. Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if coadministered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537,1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs. LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanil amide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions: Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 \u03bcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/ mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis: Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers: Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects: Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1-2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2-12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects: Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Body As A Whole: In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3-5 mg/kg every 4-6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis: The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50-300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50-100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250-500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3-10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3-6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs."

      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4\u2019-sulfonyl dianiline, is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white to creamy white crystalline powder, very slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol, soluble in acetone and dilute mineral acids. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 mg and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), and stearic acid. dapsone-struct"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions : The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4-8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 \u03bcg/mL with a range of 0.1-7.0 \u03bcg/mL. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 - 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions: Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 \u03bcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone.

      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions: The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4-8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 \u03bcg/ml with a range of 0.1-7.0 \u03bcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 - 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanil amide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions: Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 \u03bcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm3) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis: Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers: Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects: Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1-2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2-12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects: Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Body As A Whole: In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3-5 mg/kg every 4-6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis: The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50-300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50-100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250-500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3-10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3-6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs."

The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur (5.1) . Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis (5.1) (8.6) . 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TruPharma LLC at 1-877-541-5504 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 0.9% of Subjects with Acne Vulgaris in 12-week Controlled Clinical Trials Dapsone Gel, 7.5% (N=2,161) Vehicle (N=2,175) Application Site Dryness 24 (1.1%) 21 (1.0%) Application Site Pruritus 20 (0.9%) 11 (0.5%) 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with topical dapsone, serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites (7.1) . Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration (7.2) . 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1,066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

Steady-state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady-state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 340 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5%, was assessed in two 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4,340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \u201cnone\u201d corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \u201cminimal\u201d corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5 %, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

A total of 2161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5% based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5% based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel,7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N=19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5% to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0 to 24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 340 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5%, was assessed in two 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4\u2019-sulfonyl dianiline, is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white to creamy white crystalline powder, very slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol, soluble in acetone and dilute mineral acids. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 mg and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), and stearic acid."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions : The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4-8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 \u03bcg/mL with a range of 0.1-7.0 \u03bcg/mL. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 - 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions: Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 \u03bcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis: Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers: Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."
    ],
    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects: Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1-2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2-12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects: Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Body As A Whole: In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-562-4597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3-5 mg/kg every 4-6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis: The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 - 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1- 800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50-100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250-500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3-10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3-6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs."

    "spl_unclassified_section": [
      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.1 ) ( 8.6 ). 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . He molysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

A total of 2,161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 years to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 0.9% of Subjects with Acne Vulgaris in 12-week Controlled Clinical Trials Dapsone Gel, 7.5% (N =2,161) Vehicle (N =2,175) Application Site Dryness 24 (1.1%) 21 (1%) Application Site Pruritus 20 (0.9%) 11 (0.5%) 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with topical dapsone, serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Da ta A nimal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1,407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 years to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1,066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 years to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N=19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5% to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 years to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 years to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology I n Vivo Ac tivity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Dr u g Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of P ropionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne.

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 340 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period.

When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5%, was assessed in two 12- week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4,340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.1 ) ( 8.6 ). 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (incidence \u2265 0.9%) adverse reactions are application site dryness and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 0.9% of Subjects with Acne Vulgaris in 12-week Controlled Clinical Trials Dapsone Gel, 7.5% (N=2161) Vehicle (N=2175) Application Site Dryness 24 (1.1%) 21 (1.0%) Application Site Pruritus 20 (0.9%) 11 (0.5%) 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with topical dapsone, serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N=19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5% to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N=16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes, an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5%, was assessed in two 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.2 )( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug\u2010induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsonegel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin\u2010inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) are oiliness/ peeling, dryness and erythema at the application site. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/ Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis. In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with dapsone gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with dapsone gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trials for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below. Table 1- Application Site Adverse Reactions by Maximum Severity Dapsone gel, 5% (N= 1819) Vehicle (N= 1660) Application Site Event Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 9% 5% <1% 9% 6% <1% Dryness 14% 3% <1% 14% 4% <1% Oiliness/ Peeling 13% 6% <1% 15% 6% <1% The adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of subjects in either arm in the four vehicle controlled trials are presented in Table 2.

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12 month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with dapsone gel (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/ SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ) Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration. ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim \u2013 Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1 % of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12-17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5% did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline. Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 - Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone gel, 5%/ Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone gel, 5% Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during Dapsone or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 1 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during Dapsone treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0 - 24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12-15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 231 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4. Table 4 - Success (No or Minimal Acne) on the Global Acne Assessment Score at Week 12 Study 1* Study 2* Dapsone Gel, 5% N=699 Vehicle N=687 Dapsone Gel, 5% N=729 Vehicle N=738 Subjects with No or Minimal Acne 291 (42%) 223 (32%) 253 (35%) 206 (28%) *Analysis excludes subjects classified with minimal acne at baseline Table 5 presents the mean percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions from baseline to Week 12.

Female subjects tended to have greater percent reductions in lesions and greater success on the Global Acne Assessment Score than males. The breakdown by race in the clinical trials was about 73% Caucasian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Efficacy results were similar across the racial subgroups."

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water and in-soluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch, Magnesium Stearate and Microcrystalline Cellulose. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae. Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to \ufb01fty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the \ufb01rst month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a signi\ufb01cant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if coadministered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) de\ufb01ciency, or methemoglobin reductase de\ufb01ciency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced signi\ufb01cant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase de\ufb01cient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD de\ufb01cient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a signi\ufb01cant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD de\ufb01ciency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD de\ufb01cient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a de\ufb01nite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be dif\ufb01cult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (\u2026e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase de\ufb01cient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD de\ufb01cient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are in\ufb02uenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for \ufb01ve years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered con\ufb01rmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs. LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classi\ufb01ed into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the \ufb01rst year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear in\ufb01ltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.1 ) ( 8.6 ). 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 0.9% of Subjects with Acne Vulgaris in 12-week Controlled Clinical Trials Dapsone Gel, 7.5% (N=2161) Vehicle (N=2175) Application Site Dryness 24 (1.1%) 21 (1.0%) Application Site Pruritus 20 (0.9%) 11 (0.5%) 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with topical dapsone, serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N=19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5% to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N=16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes, an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size.

Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white to yellow crystalline powder. Sparingly soluble in alcohol; Soluble in acetone and in dilute mineral acids; practically insoluble in water. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch, Magnesium Stearate and Microcrystalline Cellulose. USP Dissolution Test Pending. STRUCTURE"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions: The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."
    ],
    "spl_unclassified_section": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dermatitis herpetiformis: (D.H.) Leprosy: All forms of leprosy except for cases of proven Dapsone resistance.",
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis: The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs.",
      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to Dapsone and/or its derivatives."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if coadministered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects: Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects: Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Body As A Whole: In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug."

      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone USP, 4,4\u2019-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically in-soluble in water and insoluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and silicified microcrystalline cellulose. Figure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions: The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae. Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions: Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis: Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers: Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis: The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs."

      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue Dapsone Gel, 5% if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using Dapsone Gel, 5% developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.2 )( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of Dapsone Gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue Dapsone Gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using Dapsone Gel, 5% developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue Dapsone Gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of Dapsone Gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of Dapsone Gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) are oiliness/ peeling, dryness and erythema at the application site. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TruPharma LLC at 1-877-541-5504 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/ Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis. In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with Dapsone Gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone Gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone Gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trials for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below.

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12-month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with Dapsone Gel, 5% (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/ SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ) Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration. ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim \u2013 Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of Dapsone Gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1 % of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of Dapsone Gel, 5%, followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of Dapsone Gel, 5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Dapsone Gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of Dapsone Gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12-17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for Dapsone Gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore Dapsone Gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Dapsone Gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone Gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline. Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone Gel, 5% was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 - Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone gel, 5%/ Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone Gel, 5% Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during Dapsone Gel, 5% or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 1 g/dL was similar between Dapsone Gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Dapsone Gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of Dapsone Gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups."

On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0 - 24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for Dapsone Gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical Dapsone Gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12-15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes, an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae, when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 231 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate Dapsone Gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either Dapsone Gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: 0 None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris 1 Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present 2 Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present 3 Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed 4 Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4.

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water and in-soluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch, Magnesium Stearate and Microcrystalline Cellulose. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae. Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to \ufb01fty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the \ufb01rst month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a signi\ufb01cant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if coadministered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) de\ufb01ciency, or methemoglobin reductase de\ufb01ciency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced signi\ufb01cant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase de\ufb01cient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD de\ufb01cient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a signi\ufb01cant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD de\ufb01ciency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD de\ufb01cient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a de\ufb01nite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be dif\ufb01cult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (\u2026e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844-221-7294, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase de\ufb01cient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD de\ufb01cient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are in\ufb02uenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for \ufb01ve years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered con\ufb01rmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs. LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classi\ufb01ed into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the \ufb01rst year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear in\ufb01ltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.2 ) ( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug\u2010induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin\u2010inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5. 3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5. 4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) are oiliness/peeling, dryness and erythema at the application site ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with dapsone gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with dapsone gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trials for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below.

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12 month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with dapsone gel (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone gel, 5%: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: 0 None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris 1 Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present 2 Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present 3 Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed 4 Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulf a methoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] .",

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5% in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of ACZONE Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8. 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12-17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 \u2013 Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone/Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during dapsone or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u22651 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during dapsone treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics An open-label study compared the pharmacokinetics of dapsone after dapsone gel, 5%, (110 \u00b1 60 mg/day) was applied twice daily (~BSA 22.5%) for 14 days (n=18) with a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone administered to a subgroup of patients (n=10) in a crossover design. On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12-15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 231 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5% based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5% based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5% based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.2 )( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with dapsone gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with dapsone gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trials for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyldapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12 to 17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 \u2013 Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone Gel/Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone Gel, 5% Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during dapsone gel or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u22651 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during dapsone gel treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2219h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2219h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne.

Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4. Table 4 - Success (No or Minimal Acne) on the Global Acne Assessment Score at Week 12 Study 1 Analysis excludes subjects classified with minimal acne at baseline Study 2 Dapsone Gel, 5% N=699 Vehicle N=687 Dapsone Gel, 5% N=729 Vehicle N=738 Subjects with No or Minimal Acne 291 (42%) 223 (32%) 253 (35%) 206 (28%) Table 5 presents the mean percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions from baseline to Week 12.

Female subjects tended to have greater percent reductions in lesions and greater success on the Global Acne Assessment Score than males. The breakdown by race in the clinical trials was about 73% Caucasian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Efficacy results were similar across the racial subgroups."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone, USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically in-soluble in water and insoluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 mg and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal silicone dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch. \"Image Description\""
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/mL with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/mL. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patients followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, naphthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 \u00bd years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazimine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies are negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs. LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.2 )( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) are oiliness/peeling, dryness and erythema at the application site ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with dapsone gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with dapsone gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trlals for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below.

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12 month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with dapsone gel (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12 to 17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 \u2013 Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone Gel/Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone Gel, 5% Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during dapsone gel or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u22651 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during dapsone gel treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2219h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2219h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4. Table 4 - Success (No or Minimal Acne) on the Global Acne Assessment Score at Week 12 Study 1 Analysis excludes subjects classified with minimal acne at baseline Study 2 Dapsone Gel, 5% N=699 Vehicle N=687 Dapsone Gel, 5% N=729 Vehicle N=738 Subjects with No or Minimal Acne 291 (42%) 223 (32%) 253 (35%) 206 (28%) Table 5 presents the mean percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions from baseline to Week 12.

Female subjects tended to have greater percent reductions in lesions and greater success on the Global Acne Assessment Score than males. The breakdown by race in the clinical trials was about 73% Caucasian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Efficacy results were similar across the racial subgroups."

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water and in-soluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch, Magnesium Stearate and Microcrystalline Cellulose. Chemical Structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae. Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if coadministered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats.

Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs. LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.2 )( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug\u2010induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin\u2010inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with dapsone gel (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12 to 17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone Gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 \u2013 Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone Gel/Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone Gel Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during dapsone gel or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u22651 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during dapsone gel treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: 0 None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris 1 Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present 2 Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present 3 Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed 4 Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4.

Female subjects tended to have greater percent reductions in lesions and greater success on the Global Acne Assessment Score than males. The breakdown by race in the clinical trials was about 73% Caucasian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Efficacy results were similar across the racial subgroups."

Patients with glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug\u2010induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of Dapsone Gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue Dapsone Gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin\u2010inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using Dapsone Gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue Dapsone Gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of Dapsone Gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of Dapsone Gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) are oiliness/peeling, dryness and erythema at the application site ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-922-1038 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with Dapsone Gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone Gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone Gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trials for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below.

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12 month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this study was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with Dapsone Gel (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as Dapsone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of Dapsone Gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of Dapsone Gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of Dapsone with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Dapsone Gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of Dapsone Gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12-17 years old treated with Dapsone Gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for Dapsone Gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore Dapsone Gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Dapsone Gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone Gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications.Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone Ge, 5% was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3: Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone/Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during Dapsone or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin 1 g/dL was similar between Dapsone Gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during Dapsone treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics An open-label study compared the pharmacokinetics of dapsone after Dapsone Gel, 5%, (110 \u00b1 60 mg/day) was applied twice daily (~BSA 22.5%) for 14 days (n=18) with a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone administered to a subgroup of patients (n=10) in a crossover design. On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for Dapsone Gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical Dapsone Gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of Dapsone Gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12-15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 231 times the systemic exposure observed in human as a result of use of the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5% based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of Dapsone Gel, 5% based on AUC comparisions) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate Dapsone Gel, 5%, for the treatment of subject with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subject 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trails, subjects applied either Dapsone Gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: 0. None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris 1. Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present 2. Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present 3. Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed 4. Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4 . Table 4: Success (No or Minimal Acne) on the Global Acne Assessment Score at Week 12 *Analysis excludes subjects classified with minimal acne at baseline Study 1* Study 2* Dapsone N=699 Vehicle N=687 Dapsone N=729 Vehicle N=738 Subjects with No or Minimal Acne 291 (42%) 223 (32%) 253 (35%) 206 (28%) Table 5 presents the mean percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions from baseline to Week 12.

      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically in-soluble in water and insoluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 mg and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: colloidal silicone dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/mL with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/mL. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life. Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis . Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug."
    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2\u00bd years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.1 )( 8.6 ) 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (incidence \u22650.9 %) adverse reactions are application site dryness and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-800-912-9561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim\u2013Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1,407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1,066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5%, did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Dapsone gel, 5 % and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N=16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne.

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size.

Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4,340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water and in-soluble in fixed and vegetable oils. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal Silicon Dioxide, Corn Starch, Magnesium Stearate and Microcrystalline Cellulose. Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae. Absorption and Excretion Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4 to 8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 mcg/ml with a range of 0.1 to 7.0 mcg/ml. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 to 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if coadministered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanilamide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S. typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537,1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

      "Drug Interactions Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 mcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 mcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 mcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 mcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug intreraction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1 to 2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2 to 12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Falsely Reduced HbA1c Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (\u2026e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Body As A Whole In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-844-221-7294, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3 to 5 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 to 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1-800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled - usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50 to 100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250 to 500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3 to 10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3 to 6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs. LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \"Reversal\" reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\"Reversal\") of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.1 )( 8.6 ). 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5 %, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5% based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5% based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel,7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N=19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5% to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0 to 24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 340 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5%, was assessed in two 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.2 ) ( 8.6 ). 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug\u2010induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin\u2010inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) are oiliness/ peeling, dryness and erythema at the application site ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Serious adverse reactions reported in subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, during clinical trials included but were not limited to the following: Nervous system/ Psychiatric \u2013 Suicide attempt, tonic clonic movements. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Abdominal pain, severe vomiting, pancreatitis. Other \u2013 Severe pharyngitis. In the clinical trials, a total of 12 out of 4032 subjects were reported to have depression (3 of 1660 treated with vehicle and 9 of 2372 treated with dapsone gel, 5%). Psychosis was reported in 2 of 2372 subjects treated with dapsone gel, 5%, and in 0 of 1660 subjects treated with vehicle. Combined contact sensitization/irritation studies with dapsone gel, 5%, in 253 healthy subjects resulted in at least 3 subjects with moderate erythema. Dapsone gel, 5%, did not induce phototoxicity or photoallergy in human dermal safety studies. Dapsone gel, 5%, was evaluated for 12 weeks in four controlled trials for local cutaneous events in 1819 subjects. The most common events reported from these studies include oiliness/peeling, dryness, and erythema. These data are shown by severity in Table 1 below.

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12 month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with dapsone gel (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/ SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ) Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration. ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim \u2013 Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1 % of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1169 children aged 12-17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5% did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline. Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3 - Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone Gel/ Vehicle Cross-Over Study. Dapsone Gel, 5% Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during Dapsone or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u22651 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during Dapsone treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups."

On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0 - 24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2219h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2219h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12-15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 231 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1475 and 1525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: 0 None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris 1 Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present 2 Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present 3 Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed 4 Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4.

Female subjects tended to have greater percent reductions in lesions and greater success on the Global Acne Assessment Score than males. The breakdown by race in the clinical trials was about 73% Caucasian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Efficacy results were similar across the racial subgroups."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone g el if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). \u2022 Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis ( 5.1 ) ( 8.6 ). 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (incidence \u2265 0.9%) adverse reactions are application site dryness and pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 0.9% of Subjects with Acne Vulgaris in 12-week Controlled Clinical Trials Dapsone Gel, 7.5% (N = 2161) Vehicle (N = 2175) Application Site Dryness 24 (1.1%) 21 (1.0%) Application Site Pruritus 20 (0.9%) 11 (0.5%) 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with topical dapsone, serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. \u2022 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). \u2022 Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N = 19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M = 192, F = 216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12-15 years (N = 155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N = 253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 340 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5%, was assessed in two 12-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \u201cnone\u201d corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \u201cminimal\u201d corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

      "DESCRIPTION Dapsone-USP, 4,4\u2019-sulfonyl dianiline, is a primary treatment for Dermatitis herpetiformis. It is an antibacterial drug for susceptible cases of leprosy. It is a white to creamy white crystalline powder, very slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol, soluble in acetone and dilute mineral acids. Dapsone is issued on prescription in tablets of 25 mg and 100 mg for oral use. Inactive Ingredients: Magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), and stearic acid. dapsone-struct.jpg"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Actions : The mechanism of action in Dermatitis herpetiformis has not been established. By the kinetic method in mice, Dapsone is bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium leprae . Absorption and Excretion: Dapsone, when given orally, is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. About 85 percent of the daily intake is recoverable from the urine mainly in the form of water-soluble metabolites. Excretion of the drug is slow and a constant blood level can be maintained with the usual dosage. Blood Levels: Detected a few minutes after ingestion, the drug reaches peak concentration in 4-8 hours. Daily administration for at least eight days is necessary to achieve a plateau level. With doses of 200 mg daily, this level averaged 2.3 \u03bcg/mL with a range of 0.1-7.0 \u03bcg/mL. The half-life in the plasma in different individuals varies from ten hours to fifty hours and averages twenty-eight hours. Repeat tests in the same individual are constant. Daily administration (50 - 100 mg) in leprosy patients will provide blood levels in excess of the usual minimum inhibitory concentration even for patients with a short Dapsone half-life."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS The patient should be warned to respond to the presence of clinical signs such as sore throat, fever, pallor, purpura or jaundice. Deaths associated with the administration of Dapsone have been reported from agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias. Complete blood counts should be done frequently in patients receiving Dapsone. The FDA Dermatology Advisory Committee recommended that, when feasible, counts should be done weekly for the first month, monthly for six months and semi-annually thereafter. If a significant reduction in leucocytes, platelets or hemopoiesis is noted, Dapsone should be discontinued and the patient followed intensively. Folic acid antagonists have similar effects and may increase the incidence of hematologic reactions; if co-administered with Dapsone the patient should be monitored more frequently. Patients on weekly pyrimethamine and Dapsone have developed agranulocytosis during the second and third month of therapy. Severe anemia should be treated prior to initiation of therapy and hemoglobin monitored. Hemolysis and methemoglobin may be poorly tolerated by patients with severe cardiopulmonary disease. Cutaneous reactions, especially bullous, include exfoliative dermatitis and are probably one of the most serious, though rare, complications of sulfone therapy. They are directly due to drug sensitization. Such reactions include toxic erythema, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, urticaria and erythema nodosum. If new or toxic dermatologic reactions occur, sulfone therapy must be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Leprosy reactional states, including cutaneous, are not hypersensitivity reactions to Dapsone and do not require discontinuation. See special section."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Hemolysis and Heinz body formation may be exaggerated in individuals with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or methemoglobin reductase deficiency, or hemoglobin M. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Dapsone should be given with caution to these patients or if the patient is exposed to other agents or conditions such as infection or diabetic ketosis capable of producing hemolysis. Drugs or chemicals which have produced significant hemolysis in G6PD or methemoglobin reductase deficient patients include Dapsone, sulfanil amide, nitrite, aniline, phenylhydrazine, napthalene, niridazole, nitro-furantoin and 8-amino-antimalarials such as primaquine. Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported early in therapy. Hyperbilirubinemia may occur more often in G6PD deficient patients. When feasible, baseline and subsequent monitoring of liver function is recommended; if abnormal, Dapsone should be discontinued until the source of the abnormality is established. Falsely Reduced HbA1c: Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Drug Interactions: Rifampin lowers Dapsone levels 7 to 10-fold by accelerating plasma clearance; in leprosy this reduction has not required a change in dosage. Folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine may increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. A modest interaction has been reported for patients receiving 100 mg Dapsone daily in combination with trimethoprim 5 mg/kg q6h. On Day 7, the serum Dapsone levels averaged 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 1.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg/mL for Dapsone alone. On Day 7, trimethoprim levels averaged 18.4 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg/mL in comparison to 12.4 \u00b1 4.5 \u03bcg/mL for patients not receiving Dapsone. Thus, there is a mutual interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim in which each raises the level of the other about 1.5 times. A crossover study 1 designed to assess the potential of a drug interaction between Dapsone, 100 mg/day and trimethoprim, 200 mg every 12 hours, in eight asymptomatic HIV positive volunteers (average CD4 count 524 cells/mm 3 ) demonstrated that there was not a significant drug interaction between Dapsone and trimethoprim. However, an earlier report 2 also by Lee et al, in 78 HIV infected patients with acute Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, receiving Dapsone, 100 mg/day and higher trimethoprim dose, 20 mg/kg/day, demonstrated that the serum levels of Dapsone were increased by 40% and trimethoprim levels were increased by 48% when the drugs were administered concurrently. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis: Dapsone has been found carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for male rats and female mice causing mesenchymal tumors in the spleen and peritoneum, and thyroid carcinoma in female rats. Dapsone is not mutagenic with or without microsomal activation in S . typhimurium tester strains 1535, 1537, 1538, 98, or 100. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dapsone. Extensive, but uncontrolled experience and two published surveys on the use of Dapsone in pregnant women have not shown that Dapsone increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during all trimesters of pregnancy or can affect reproduction capacity. Because of the lack of animal studies or controlled human experience, Dapsone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. In general, for leprosy, USPHS at Carville recommends maintenance of Dapsone. Dapsone has been important for the management of some pregnant D.H. patients. Nursing Mothers: Dapsone is excreted in breast milk in substantial amounts. Hemolytic reactions can occur in neonates. See section on hemolysis. Because of the potential for tumorgenicity shown for Dapsone in animal studies a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Pediatric patients are treated on the same schedule as adults but with correspondingly smaller doses. Dapsone is generally not considered to have an effect on the later growth, development and functional development of the pediatric patient."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS In addition to the warnings listed above, the following syndromes and serious reactions have been reported in patients on Dapsone. Hematologic Effects: Dose-related hemolysis is the most common adverse effect and is seen in patients with or without G6PD deficiency. Almost all patients demonstrate the inter-related changes of a loss of 1-2g of hemoglobin, an increase in the reticulocytes (2-12%), a shortened red cell life span and a rise in methemoglobin. G6PD deficient patients have greater responses. Nervous System Effects: Peripheral neuropathy is a definite but unusual complication of Dapsone therapy in non-leprosy patients. Motor loss is predominant. If muscle weakness appears, Dapsone should be withdrawn. Recovery on withdrawal is usually substantially complete. The mechanism of recovery is reported by axonal regeneration. Some recovered patients have tolerated retreatment at reduced dosage. In leprosy this complication may be difficult to distinguish from a leprosy reactional state. Falsely Reduced HbA1c: Falsely reduced HbA1c measurements have been reported with dapsone use. Alternate measures of glycemic control (e.g., fructosamine and/or more frequent blood glucose monitoring) are recommended when a discordance between HbA1c and blood glucose concentrations are observed or suspected. Falsely reduced HbA1c may occur without overt evidence of hemolysis or anemia. Body As A Whole: In addition to the warnings and adverse effects reported above, additional adverse reactions include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, pancreatitis, vertigo, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, fever, headache, psychosis, phototoxicity, pulmonary eosinophilia, tachycardia, albuminuria, the nephrotic syndrome, hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, renal papillary necrosis, male infertility, drug-induced Lupus erythematosus and an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome. In general, with the exception of the complications of severe anoxia from overdosage (retinal and optic nerve damage, etc.) these adverse reactions have regressed off drug.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Nausea, vomiting, hyperexcitability can appear a few minutes up to 24 hours after ingestion of an overdosage. Methemoglobin induced depression, convulsions or severe cyanosis requires prompt treatment. In normal and methemoglobin reductase deficient patients, methylene blue, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight, given slowly intravenously, is the treatment of choice. The effect is complete in 30 minutes, but may have to be repeated if methemoglobin reaccumulates. For non-emergencies, if treatment is needed, methylene blue may be given orally in doses of 3-5 mg/kg every 4-6 hours. Methylene blue reduction depends on G6PD and should not be given to fully expressed G6PD deficient patients."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dermatitis herpetiformis: The dosage should be individually titrated starting in adults with 50 mg daily and correspondingly smaller doses in children. If full control is not achieved within the range of 50 - 300 mg daily, higher doses may be tried. Dosage should be reduced to a minimum maintenance level as soon as possible. In responsive patients there is a prompt reduction in pruritus followed by clearance of skin lesions. There is no effect on the gastrointestinal component of the disease. Dapsone levels are influenced by acetylation rates. Patients with high acetylation rates, or who are receiving treatment affecting acetylation may require an adjustment in dosage. A strict gluten free diet is an option for the patient to elect, permitting many to reduce or eliminate the need for Dapsone; the average time for dosage reduction is 8 months with a range of 4 months to 2 1/2 years and for dosage elimination 29 months with a range of 6 months to 9 years. Leprosy: In order to reduce secondary Dapsone resistance, the WHO Expert Committee on Leprosy and the USPHS at Carville, LA, recommended that Dapsone should be commenced in combination with one or more anti-leprosy drugs. In the multidrug program Dapsone should be maintained at the full dosage of 100 mg daily without interruption (with corresponding smaller doses for children) and provided to all patients who have sensitive organisms with new or recrudescent disease or who have not yet completed a two year course of Dapsone monotherapy. For advice and other drugs, the USPHS at Carville, LA (1- 800-642-2477) should be contacted. Before using other drugs consult appropriate product labeling. In bacteriologically negative tuberculoid and indeterminate disease, the recommendation is the coadministration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with six months of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO, daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. The Dapsone is continued until all signs of clinical activity are controlled usually after an additional six months. Then Dapsone should be continued for an additional three years for tuberculoid and indeterminate patients and for five years for borderline tuberculoid patients. In lepromatous and borderline lepromatous patients, the recommendation is the co-administration of Dapsone 100 mg daily with two years of Rifampin 600 mg daily. Under WHO daily Rifampin may be replaced by 600 mg Rifampin monthly, if supervised. One may elect the concurrent administration of a third anti-leprosy drug, usually either Clofazamine 50-100 mg daily or Ethionamide 250-500 mg daily. Dapsone 100 mg daily is continued 3-10 years until all signs of clinical activity are controlled with skin scrapings and biopsies negative for one year. Dapsone should then be continued for an additional 10 years for borderline patients and for life for lepromatous patients. Secondary Dapsone resistance should be suspected whenever a lepromatous or borderline lepromatous patient receiving Dapsone treatment relapses clinically and bacteriologically, solid staining bacilli being found in the smears taken from the new active lesions. If such cases show no response to regular and supervised Dapsone therapy within three to six months or good compliance for the past 3-6 months can be assured, Dapsone resistance should be considered confirmed clinically. Determination of drug sensitivity using the mouse footpad method is recommended and, after prior arrangement, is available without charge from the USPHS, Carville, LA. Patients with proven Dapsone resistance should be treated with other drugs."

      "LEPROSY REACTIONAL STATES Abrupt changes in clinical activity occur in leprosy with any effective treatment and are known as reactional states. The majority can be classified into two groups. The \u201cReversal\u201d reaction (Type 1) may occur in borderline or tuberculoid leprosy patients often soon after chemotherapy is started. The mechanism is presumed to result from a reduction in the antigenic load: the patient is able to mount an enhanced delayed hypersensitivity response to residual infection leading to swelling (\u201cReversal\u201d) of existing skin and nerve lesions. If severe, or if neuritis is present, large doses of steroids should always be used. If severe, the patient should be hospitalized. In general anti-leprosy treatment is continued and therapy to suppress the reaction is indicated such as analgesics, steroids, or surgical decompression of swollen nerve trunks. USPHS at Carville, LA should be contacted for advice in management. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) (lepromatous reaction) (Type 2 reaction) occurs mainly in lepromatous patients and small numbers of borderline patients. Approximately 50% of treated patients show this reaction in the first year. The principal clinical features are fever and tender erythematous skin nodules sometimes associated with malaise, neuritis, orchitis, albuminuria, joint swelling, iritis, epistaxis or depression. Skin lesions can become pustular and/or ulcerate. Histologically there is a vasculitis with an intense polymorphonuclear infiltrate. Elevated circulating immune complexes are considered to be the mechanism of reaction. If severe, patients should be hospitalized. In general, anti-leprosy treatment is continued. Analgesics, steroids, and other agents available from USPHS, Carville, LA, are used to suppress the reaction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5% if signs of methemoglobinemia occur. (5.1) Hematologic Effects: Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5% developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. (5.2) , (8.6) 5.1 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose\u20106\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug\u2010induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in, e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin\u2010inducing agents. 5.2 Hematologic Effects Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5% developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. There was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or anemia in patients treated with dapsone gel, 5%, including patients who were G6PD deficient. Discontinue dapsone gel, 5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment. 5.4 Skin Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone gel, 5% treatment."

In addition, 486 subjects were evaluated in a 12 month safety trial. The adverse event profile in this trial was consistent with that observed in the vehicle-controlled trials. 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with dapsone gel, 5% (topical dapsone) serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the level of dapsone and its metabolites. (7.1) Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration. (7.2) 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC 0-12 ) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel, 5% followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 5% use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 250 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 400 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 956 times [rats] and 289 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 382 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summar y There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is minimal relative to oral dapsone administration; however, it is known that dapsone is present in human milk following administration of oral dapsone. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy was evaluated in 1,169 children aged 12 to 17 years old treated with dapsone gel, 5%, in the clinical trials. The adverse event rate for dapsone gel, 5%, was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and efficacy was not studied in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, therefore dapsone gel, 5%, is not recommended for use in this age group. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 5%, did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 G6PD Deficiency Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. There were 56 out of 64 subjects who had a Week 2 blood draw and applied at least 50% of treatment applications. Table 3 contains results from testing of relevant hematology parameters for these two treatment periods. Dapsone gel, 5% was associated with a 0.32 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after two weeks of treatment, but hemoglobin levels generally returned to baseline levels at Week 12. Table 3: Mean Hemoglobin, Bilirubin, and Reticulocyte Levels in Acne Subjects with G6PD Deficiency in Dapsone Gel, 5%/Vehicle Cross-Over Study Dapsone gel, 5% Vehicle N Mean N Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) Pre-treatment 53 13.44 56 13.36 2 weeks 53 13.12 55 13.34 12 weeks 50 13.42 50 13.37 Bilirubin (mg/dL) Pre-treatment 54 0.58 56 0.55 2 weeks 53 0.65 55 0.56 12 weeks 50 0.61 50 0.62 Reticulocytes (%) Pre-treatment 53 1.30 55 1.34 2 weeks 53 1.51 55 1.34 12 weeks 50 1.48 50 1.41 There were no changes from baseline in haptoglobin or lactate dehydrogenase during dapsone gel, 5% or vehicle treatment at either the 2-week or 12-week time point. The proportion of subjects who experienced decreases in hemoglobin \u2265 1 g/dL was similar between dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle treatment (8 of 58 subjects had such decreases during dapsone gel, 5% treatment compared to 7 of 56 subjects during vehicle treatment among subjects with at least one on-treatment hemoglobin assessment). Subgroups based on gender, race, or G6PD enzyme activity did not display any differences in laboratory results from the overall study group. There was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics An open-label study compared the pharmacokinetics of dapsone after dapsone gel, 5%, (110 \u00b1 60 mg/day) was applied twice daily (~BSA 22.5%) for 14 days (n=18) with a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone administered to a subgroup of patients (n=10) in a crossover design. On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical trials. Because no microbiology studies were done, there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics An open-label study compared the pharmacokinetics of dapsone after dapsone gel, 5%, (110 \u00b1 60 mg/day) was applied twice daily (~BSA 22.5%) for 14 days (n=18) with a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone administered to a subgroup of patients (n=10) in a crossover design. On Day 14 the mean dapsone AUC 0-24h was 415 \u00b1 224 ng\u2022h/mL for dapsone gel, 5%, whereas following a single 100 mg dose of oral dapsone the AUC 0-infinity was 52,641 \u00b1 36,223 ng\u2022h/mL. Exposure after the oral dose of 100 mg dapsone was approximately 100 times greater than after the topical dapsone gel, 5% dose, twice a day. In a long-term safety study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment, periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 patients. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 patients (M=192, F=216), obtained at month 3, neither gender, nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these patients."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dapsone was not carcinogenic to rats when orally administered to females for 92 weeks or males for 100 weeks at dose levels up to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 231 times the systemic exposure observed in humans as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons). No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenesis was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 127 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 956 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, clinical trials were conducted to evaluate dapsone gel, 5%, for the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris (N=1,475 and 1,525). The trials were designed to enroll subjects 12 years of age and older with 20 to 50 inflammatory and 20 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline. In these trials, subjects applied either dapsone gel, 5%, or vehicle control twice daily for up to 12 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of success on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) and in the percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions. The Global Acne Assessment Score was a 5-point scale as follows: 0. None: no evidence of facial acne vulgaris 1. Minimal: few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) may be present 2. Mild: several to many non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) are present; a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present 3. Moderate: many non-inflammatory (comedones) and inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) are present; no nodulo-cystic lesions are allowed 4. Severe: significant degree of inflammatory disease; papules/pustules are a predominant feature; a few nodulo-cystic lesions may be present; comedones may be present. The success rates on the Global Acne Assessment Score (no or minimal acne) at Week 12 are presented in Table 4. Table 4: Success (No or Minimal Acne) on the Global Acne Assessment Score at Week 12 Study 1* Study 2* Dapsone gel, 5% N=699 Vehicle N=687 Dapsone gel, 5% N=729 Vehicle N=738 Subjects with No or Minimal Acne 291 (42%) 223 (32%) 253 (35%) 206 (28%) *Analysis excludes subjects classified with minimal acne at baseline Table 5 presents the mean percent reduction in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesions from baseline to Week 12.

Female subjects tended to have greater percent reductions in lesions and greater success on the Global Acne Assessment Score than males. The breakdown by race in the clinical trials was about 73% Caucasian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic, and 2% Asian. Efficacy results were similar across the racial subgroups."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur ( 5.1 ). Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis. ( 5.1 )( 8.6 ) 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5% treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5% twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] . Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

A total of 2,161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites ( 7.1 ). Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Trimethoprim\u2013Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data]. The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1,407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 12 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1,066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

Steady state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity: No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance: No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of dapsone gel, 7.5% was assessed in two 12 week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials. Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4,340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \"none\" or \"minimal\" with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \"none\" corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \"minimal\" corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Methemoglobinemia: Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported. Discontinue dapsone gel if signs of methemoglobinemia occur (5.1) . Hemolysis: Some patients with Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency using topical dapsone developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis (5.1) (8.6) . 5.1 Hematological Effects Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia, with resultant hospitalization, have been reported postmarketing in association with twice daily dapsone gel, 5%, treatment. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia are more susceptible to drug-induced methemoglobinemia. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in those patients with congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia. Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia may be delayed some hours after exposure. Initial signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia are characterized by a slate grey cyanosis seen in e.g., buccal mucous membranes, lips, and nail beds. Advise patients to discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5% and seek immediate medical attention in the event of cyanosis. Dapsone can cause elevated methemoglobin levels particularly in conjunction with methemoglobin-inducing agents [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Hemolysis Oral dapsone treatment has produced dose-related hemolysis and hemolytic anemia. Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are more prone to hemolysis with the use of certain drugs. G6PD deficiency is most prevalent in populations of African, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ancestry. In clinical trials, there was no evidence of clinically relevant hemolysis or hemolytic anemia in subjects treated with topical dapsone. Some subjects with G6PD deficiency using dapsone gel, 5%, twice daily developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Discontinue dapsone gel, 7.5%, if signs and symptoms suggestive of hemolytic anemia occur. Avoid use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients who are taking oral dapsone or antimalarial medications because of the potential for hemolytic reactions. Combination of dapsone gel, 7.5%, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) may increase the likelihood of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness) has been reported with oral dapsone treatment. No events of peripheral neuropathy were observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment. 5.3 Skin Reactions Skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria) have been reported with oral dapsone treatment. These types of skin reactions were not observed in clinical trials with topical dapsone treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common (incidence \u2265 0.9%) adverse reactions are application site dryness and pruritus (6.1) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2,161 subjects were treated with dapsone gel, 7.5%, for 12 weeks in 2 controlled clinical trials. The population ranged in age from 12 to 63 years, was 56% female, and 58% Caucasian. Adverse drug reactions that were reported in at least 0.9% of subjects treated with dapsone gel, 7.5% appear in Table 1 below. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 0.9% of Subjects with Acne Vulgaris in 12-week Controlled Clinical Trials Dapsone Gel, 7.5% (N=2,161) Vehicle (N=2,175) Application Site Dryness 24 (1.1%) 21 (1.0%) Application Site Pruritus 20 (0.9%) 11 (0.5%) 6.2 Experience with Oral Use of Dapsone Although not observed in the clinical trials with topical dapsone, serious adverse reactions have been reported with oral use of dapsone, including agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (motor loss and muscle weakness), and skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, morbilliform and scarlatiniform reactions, bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, erythema nodosum, and urticaria). 6.3 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of topical dapsone: methemoglobinemia, rash (including erythematous rash, application site rash) and swelling of face (including lip swelling, eye swelling)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) increases the systemic level of dapsone and its metabolites (7.1) . Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone gel, 7.5% may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration (7.2) . 7.1 Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5% in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged, however, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX. 7.2 Topical Benzoyl Peroxide Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in patients with acne vulgaris may result in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair. 7.3 Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John\u2019s wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions. 7.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia Concomitant use of dapsone gel, 7.5% with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para\u2010aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on dapsone gel, 7.5%, use in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes. The systemic absorption of dapsone in humans following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In animal reproduction studies, oral doses of dapsone administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis that resulted in systemic exposures more than 400 times the systemic exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of dapsone gel, 7.5%, resulted in embryocidal effects. When orally administered to rats from the onset of organogenesis through the end of lactation at systemic exposures approximately 500 times the exposure at the MRHD, dapsone resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased pup weight [see Data ] . The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Dapsone has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when administered orally daily to females during organogenesis at dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. These dosages resulted in systemic exposures that represented approximately 1407 times [rats] and 425 times [rabbits] the systemic exposure observed in human females as a result of use of the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons. These effects were probably secondary to maternal toxicity. Dapsone was assessed for effects on perinatal/postnatal pup development and postnatal maternal behavior and function in a study in which dapsone was orally administered to female rats daily beginning on the seventh day of gestation and continuing until the twenty-seventh day postpartum. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption) and developmental effects (increase in stillborn pups and decreased pup weight) were seen at a dapsone dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 563 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons). No effects were observed on the viability, physical development, behavior, learning ability, or reproductive function of surviving pups. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of topical dapsone in breastmilk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Orally administered dapsone appears in human milk and could result in hemolytic anemia and hyperbilirubinemia especially in infants with G6PD deficiency. Systemic absorption of dapsone following topical application is low relative to oral dapsone administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for dapsone gel, 7.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from dapsone gel, 7.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5% for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in patients 9 years of age and older. Use of dapsone gel, 7.5% in patients 9 to 11 years of age for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in 1,066 subjects 12 years of age and older and with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age from an open label study of 100 subjects with acne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety profile for dapsone gel, 7.5% in clinical trials was similar to the vehicle control group. Safety and effectiveness of dapsone gel, 7.5%, have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of dapsone gel, 7.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 8.6 Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Deficiency Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency may be more prone to methemoglobinemia and hemolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dapsone gel, 5% and vehicle were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design clinical study of 64 subjects with G6PD deficiency and acne vulgaris. Subjects were Black (88%), Asian (6%), Hispanic (2%) or of other racial origin (5%). Blood samples were taken at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 during both vehicle and dapsone gel, 5% treatment periods. Some of these subjects developed laboratory changes suggestive of hemolysis, but there was no evidence of clinically significant hemolytic anemia in this study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dapsone gel in treating acne vulgaris is not known. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a pharmacokinetic study, male and female subjects 16 years of age or older with acne vulgaris (N=19) applied 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5% to the face, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 28 days. Steady-state for dapsone was reached within 7 days of dosing. On Day 28, the mean dapsone maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours post dose (AUC 0-24h ) were 13.0 \u00b1 6.8 ng/mL and 282 \u00b1 146 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. The systemic exposure from dapsone gel, 7.5% is expected to be about 1% of that from a 100 mg oral dose. Long-term safety studies were not conducted with dapsone gel, 7.5%, however, in a long-term clinical study of dapsone gel, 5% treatment (twice daily), periodic blood samples were collected up to 12 months to determine systemic exposure of dapsone and its metabolites in approximately 500 subjects. Based on the measurable dapsone concentrations from 408 subjects (M=192, F=216), obtained at Month 3, neither gender nor race appeared to affect the pharmacokinetics of dapsone. Similarly, dapsone exposures were approximately the same between the age groups of 12 to 15 years (N=155) and those greater than or equal to 16 years (N=253). There was no evidence of increasing systemic exposure to dapsone over the study year in these subjects. In an open label safety and pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age with acne vulgaris, a subset of subjects (N = 16) received once daily topical application of approximately 2 grams of dapsone gel, 7.5%, to the entire face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back for 8 days. On Day 8, the systemic concentrations were at or near steady-state and the mean \u00b1 SD systemic concentration of dapsone at 10 hours post dose was 20 \u00b1 12.5 ng/mL. 12.4 Microbiology In Vivo Activity : No microbiology or immunology studies were conducted during dapsone gel, 7.5% clinical studies. Drug Resistance : No dapsone resistance studies were conducted during dapsone gel clinical studies therefore there are no data available as to whether dapsone treatment may have resulted in decreased susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes , an organism associated with acne, or to other antimicrobials that may be used to treat acne. Therapeutic resistance to dapsone has been reported for Mycobacterium leprae , when patients have been treated with oral dapsone."

No evidence of potential to induce carcinogenicity was observed in a dermal study in which dapsone gel was topically applied to Tg.AC transgenic mice for approximately 26 weeks. Dapsone concentrations of 3%, 5%, and 10% were evaluated; 3% material was judged to be the maximum tolerated dosage. Dapsone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), and was negative in a micronucleus assay conducted in mice. Dapsone was positive (clastogenic) in a chromosome aberration assay conducted with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The effects of dapsone on fertility and general reproductive performance were assessed in male and female rats following oral dosing. Dapsone reduced sperm motility at dosages of 3 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 22 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) when administered daily beginning 63 days prior to mating and continuing through the mating period. The mean numbers of embryo implantations and viable embryos were significantly reduced in untreated females mated with males that had been dosed at 12 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 187 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons), presumably due to reduced numbers or effectiveness of sperm, indicating impairment of fertility. When administered to female rats at a dosage of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 1,407 times the systemic exposure that is associated with the MRHD of dapsone gel, 7.5%, based on AUC comparisons) for 15 days prior to mating and for 17 days thereafter, dapsone reduced the mean number of implantations, increased the mean early resorption rate, and reduced the mean litter size. These effects probably were secondary to maternal toxicity."

Efficacy was assessed in a total of 4,340 subjects 12 years of age and older. The majority of the subjects had moderate acne vulgaris, 20 to 50 inflammatory and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions at baseline, and were randomized to receive either dapsone gel, 7.5% or vehicle. Treatment response was defined at Week 12 as the proportion of subjects who were rated \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d with at least a two-grade improvement from baseline on the Global Acne Assessment Score (GAAS), and mean absolute change from baseline in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. A GAAS score of \u201cnone\u201d corresponded to no evidence of facial acne vulgaris. A GAAS score of \u201cminimal\u201d corresponded to a few non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) being present and to a few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules) that may be present. The GAAS success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 2.
