      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer Paricalcitol Capsules orally once daily or three times a week. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Starting Dose Based upon Baseline iPTH Level Baseline iPTH Level Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dose* Less than or equal to 500 pg/mL 1 mcg 2 mcg More than 500 pg/mL 2 mcg 4 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day Dose Titration Table 2. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Dose Titration Base upon iPTH Level Dose Adjustment at 2 to 4 Week Intervals iPTH Level Relative to Baseline Paricalcitol Capsule Dose Daily Dosage Three Times a Week Dosage* The same, increased or decreased by less than 30% Increase dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg Decreased by more than or equal to 30% and less than or equal to 60% Maintain dose - - Decreased by more than 60% or iPTH less than 60 pg/mL Decrease dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day If a patient is taking the lowest dose, 1 mcg, on the daily regimen and a dose reduction is needed, the dose can be decreased to 1 mcg three times a week. If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Dose Titration Individualize the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus level. Titrate Paricalcitol Capsules dose based on following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio ((e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of Paricalcitol Capsules during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol Capsules may be taken without regard to food. Initial Dosage:CKD Stage 3 and 4 (2.1) Adult:Baseline iPTH \u2264 500 pg/mL 1 mcg orally daily or 2 mcg three times a week* Adult: Baseline iPTH > 500 pg/mL 2 mcg orally daily or 4 mcg three times a week* Dose Titration : CKD Stage 3 and 4 (2.1) Adult : iPTH same, increased or decreased by <30% relative to baseline Increase dose by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week* Adult : iPTH decreased by \u2265 30% and \u2264 60% relative to baseline Maintain dose Adult : iPTH decreased by > 60% or iPTH < 60% pg/mL relative to baseline Decrease dose by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week* *Not more frequently than every other day when dosing three times a week Initial dosage : CKD Stage 5 (2.2) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds. including Paricalcitol Capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with Paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Paricalcitol Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, Paricalcitol Capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with Paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of Paricalcitol Capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Paricalcitol treatment (5.1). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Paricalcitol Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol Capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 5 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with Paricalcitol capsules. Table 5: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of Paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take Paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take Paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7). Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least one hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil (7)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with Paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug- associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to[ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Paricalcitol Capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of Paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with Paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug- associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of Paricalcitol Capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of Paricalcitol Capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% -13.0%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of Paricalcitol Capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e, were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than Paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers,the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3,4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC o-\u221e . approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers,the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3,4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC o-\u221e . approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of Paricalcitol Capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 Clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received Paricalcitol Capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145-856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of Paricalcitol Capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, Paricalcitol Capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, Paricalcitol Capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of Paricalcitol Capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to <60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased <30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u226410.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was >5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the Paricalcitol Capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 82% of the placebo treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u226530% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients (p <0.001). The proportion of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the Paricalcitol Capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 7.

The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received Paricalcitol Capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African-American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216-1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of Paricalcitol Capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week\u2019s calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol Capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was 88% of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5mg/dL) in patients treated with Paricalcitol Capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with Paricalcitol Capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with Paricalcitol Capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Initial Dosage: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Dose three times a week.* * Not more frequently than every other day. CKD Stage 5: To avoid hypercalcemia only treat patients after their baseline serum calcium has been reduced to 9.5 mg/dL or lower (2.2). 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer paricalcitol capsules orally once daily or three times a week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1.

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment ( 5.1 ). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds ( 5.2 ). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) ( 5.3 ). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. \u2022 Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution ( 7 ). \u2022 Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil ( 7 )."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug\u2011associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug\u2011associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol, USP, the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules, is a synthetically manufactured, metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D 2 ) and the A (19-nor) ring. Paricalcitol is available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram, 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides, alcohol, and butylated hydroxytoluene. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide yellow (2 microgram and 4 microgram capsules), iron oxide black (1 microgram capsules only), and water. The capsules are printed with black ink composed of purified water, black iron oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Paricalcitol is a white, crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C 27 H 44 O 3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% - 13.0%) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 82% of the placebo-treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients compared to placebo.

The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African- American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week's calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia: Can occur during treatment with Paricalcitol Injection and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention. The risk may be increased when Paricalcitol Injection is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D compounds. Inform patients about symptoms of hypercalcemia and monitor serum calcium prior to initiation and during treatment and adjust dose accordingly ( 2 , 5.1 ). Digitalis Toxicity: Risk increases with hypercalcemia. In patients using digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Monitor more frequently when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection ( 5.2 ). Adynamic Bone Disease: May develop and increase risk of fractures if intact PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels and adjust dose if needed ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during Paricalcitol Injection treatment. Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention. Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or other vitamin D compounds [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In addition, high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy may be at increased risk for development of hypercalcemia with Paricalcitol Injection. In these circumstances, frequent serum calcium monitoring and Paricalcitol Injection dose adjustments may be required. When initiating Paricalcitol Injection or adjusting Paricalcitol Injection dose, measure serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly). Once a maintenance dose has been established, measure serum calcium at least monthly. If hypercalcemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue Paricalcitol Injection until serum calcium is normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 )] . Inform patients about the symptoms of elevated calcium (feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss) and instruct them to report new or worsening symptoms when they occur. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Paricalcitol Injection can cause hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if intact PTH levels are suppressed by Paricalcitol Injection to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid over suppression and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose, if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 )] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Adynamic Bone Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) are nausea, vomiting and edema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Paricalcitol Injection has been established from adequate and well-controlled studies of another paricalcitol injection product [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Below is a display of the adverse reactions of paricalcitol injection in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Four placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies were conducted in 113 patients (51% male, 10% Caucasian, 81% African-American and 9% Hispanic, ranging in age from 18 to 90 years). Sixty-two patients were exposed to paricalcitol injection and the average dose at the end of treatment was 0.12 mcg/kg/dose with a mean number of 55 days of dosing across the studies. Discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse reaction occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with paricalcitol injection and 2.0% of patients treated with placebo. Adverse reactions occurring with greater frequency in the paricalcitol injection group and at a frequency of 2% or greater are presented in Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Paricalcitol Injection. Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol Injection Drugs that May Increase the risk of Hypercalcemia Clinical Impact Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or other vitamin D compounds may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Thiazide diuretics are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine. Examples Calcium-containing products, other vitamin D compounds or thiazide diuretics Intervention Monitor calcium more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Digitalis Compounds Clinical Impact Paricalcitol Injection can cause hypercalcemia which can potentiate the risk of digitalis toxicity. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of serum calcium monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection in patients receiving digitalis compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol Injection is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Exposure of Paricalcitol Injection will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples Clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, and voriconazole Intervention If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, dose adjustment of Paricalcitol Injection may be necessary. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases Paricalcitol Injection exposure. Dose adjustment may be necessary. Closely monitor intact PTH and serum calcium. ( 2.4 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with Paricalcitol Injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 14 mcg (equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg), based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the risk for maternal hypertension and preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm delivery, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight infants. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by intravenous injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3 or 20 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data) . Infants exposed to Paricalcitol Injection through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Paricalcitol Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from Paricalcitol Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Paricalcitol Injection through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, including seizures, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. Monitoring of serum calcium in the infant should be considered. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Paricalcitol Injection for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with CKD have been established in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older with CKD on dialysis. Use of Paricalcitol Injection for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study of another paricalcitol injection product in 29 patients, 5 to 19 years of age, with CKD on hemodialysis [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The safety and efficacy of Paricalcitol Injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 5 years old. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of paricalcitol injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were studied in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and were similar to that of patients with normal hepatic function. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic function. Paricalcitol Injection has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Within two hours after administering paricalcitol injection intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 mcg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with three times a week dosing. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u226599.8%). In healthy subjects, the steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 23.8 L. The mean volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is between 31 and 35 L. Elimination Metabolism After intravenous administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces and no parent drug found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation (present at low levels in plasma), as well as 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Excretion Paricalcitol is excreted primarily by hepatobiliary excretion. Approximately 63% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the feces and 19% was recovered in the urine in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is about five to seven hours over the studied dose range of 0.04 to 0.16 mcg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol after administration of 0.24 mcg/kg paricalcitol IV bolus dose in CKD HD and PD patients is 13.9 and 15.4 hours, respectively (Table 5).

The degree of accumulation was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric and pediatric patients. Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were gender independent. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n=5) and moderate (n=5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol were similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol have been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis procedure has essentially no effect on paricalcitol elimination. However, compared to healthy subjects, CKD patients on dialysis showed a decreased CL and increased half-life. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL) (approximately 20-fold greater than that obtained after highest tested dose). In fresh primary cultured hepatocytes, the induction observed at paricalcitol concentrations up to 50 nM was less than two-fold for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A, where the positive controls rendered a six- to nineteen-fold induction. Hence, paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Drug interactions with paricalcitol injection have not been studied. The following studies have been performed with oral paricalcitol capsules. Omeprazole The pharmacokinetic interaction between paricalcitol capsule (16 mcg) and omeprazole (40 mg; oral), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were unaffected when omeprazole was administrated approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days, on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol capsule has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg administered 3 times per week (at less than clinical exposure to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Paricalcitol Injection have been established based on adult studies of another paricalcitol injection product in patients with CKD on hemodialysis. Below is a display of the results of these studies of paricalcitol injection. Adult Studies in CKD on Dialysis Three 12-week, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 78 patients with CKD on hemodialysis. In these studies, patients ranged in age from 22 to 90 years, 51% were males, 13% were Caucasian, 79% were African-American, and 8% were Hispanic. The most common causes of renal failure were hypertension and diabetes. The dose of paricalcitol injection was started at 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week intravenously. The dose was increased by 0.04 mcg/kg every 2 weeks until intact PTH levels were decreased at least 30% from baseline or a fifth escalation brought the dose to 0.24 mcg/kg, or intact PTH fell to less than 100 pg/mL, or the Ca \u00d7 P product was greater than 75 within any 2 week period, or serum calcium became greater than 11.5 mg/dL at any time. Patients treated with paricalcitol injection achieved a mean intact PTH reduction of 30% within 6 weeks. The results from these studies are as follows: Table 6: Mean Changes from Baseline to Final Evaluation in intact PTH, Alkaline Phosphatase, Phosphorus and Calcium \u00d7 Phosphorus Product in Adult Patients with CKD on Dialysis in Three 12-Week Placebo-Controlled Studies Group (No. of Pts.) Baseline Mean (Range) Mean (SE) Change From Baseline to Final Evaluation intact PTH (pg/mL) Paricalcitol Injection (n = 40) 783 (291 - 2076) -379 (43.7) placebo (n = 38) 745 (320 - 1671) -69.6 (44.8) Alkaline Phosphatase (U/L) Paricalcitol Injection (n = 31) 150 (40 - 600) -41.5 (10.6) placebo (n = 34) 169 (56 - 911) +2.6 (10.1) Phosphorus (mg/dL) Paricalcitol Injection (n = 40) 5.8 (3.7 - 10.2) +0.47 (0.3) placebo (n = 38) 6.0 (2.8 - 8.8) -0.47 (0.3) Calcium \u00d7 Phosphorus Product Paricalcitol Injection (n = 40) 54 (32 - 106) +7.9 (2.2) placebo (n = 38) 54 (26 - 77) -3.9 (2.3) Pediatric Study in CKD on Dialysis Paricalcitol Injection was evaluated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 29 pediatric patients, aged 5 to 19 years, with CKD on hemodialysis; nearly all had received some form of vitamin D prior to the study. Of the 29 patients, 76% were male, 52% were Caucasian and 45% were African-American. The initial dose of paricalcitol injection was 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of 500 pg/mL or greater. The dose of paricalcitol injection was adjusted in 0.04 mcg/kg increments based on the levels of serum intact PTH, calcium and Ca \u00d7 P. The mean baseline levels of intact PTH were 841 pg/mL for the 15 patients treated with paricalcitol injection and 740 pg/mL for the 14 placebo-treated patients. The mean dose of paricalcitol injection administered was 4.6 mcg (range: 0.8 mcg to 9.6 mcg). Sixty-seven percent of the patients treated with paricalcitol injection and 14% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial. Seventy-one percent of the placebo-treated patients discontinued due to excessive elevations in intact PTH levels, as defined by 2 consecutive intact PTH levels greater than 700 pg/mL and greater than baseline after 4 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated that 60% of patients treated with paricalcitol injection and 21% of placebo-treated patients achieved two consecutive greater than or equal to 30% reductions from baseline in intact PTH."

If a satisfactory parathyroid hormone (PTH) lowering response is not observed using the recommended starting dose, the dose may be increased by 2 to 4 mcg every 2 to 4 weeks based on PTH levels (refer to Table 1). Table 1: Suggested Dosage Adjustment PTH Level at Follow-up Visit Dosage Adjustment Above target and PTH increased Increase Above target and PTH decreased by less than 30% Increase Above target and PTH decreased by 30 to 60% No Change Above target and PTH decreased by more than 60% Decrease At target and PTH stable No Change When initiating Paricalcitol Injection or adjusting Paricalcitol Injection dose, measure serum calcium and phosphorus frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and PTH every 2 to 4 weeks. Once a maintenance dose has been established, serum calcium and phosphorus should be measured at least monthly and plasma PTH every 3 months. The recommended starting dose is 0.04 mcg/kg to 0.1 mcg/kg (2.8 \u2013 7 mcg). Administer Paricalcitol Injection as a bolus through a hemodialysis vascular access port at any time during dialysis. Dosing should not occur more frequently than every other day. Do not inject Paricalcitol Injection directly into a vein. Paricalcitol Injection dose should be individualized. If a satisfactory PTH lowering response is not observed with the initial dose, the dose may be increased by 2 to 4 mcg at 2- to 4- week intervals based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia : The risk may be increased when Paricalcitol Injection is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or metabolically inactive or active forms of vitamin D. Monitor serum calcium when using Paricalcitol Injection and adjust dose accordingly. ( 5.1 ) Digitalis Toxicity : Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the concentration of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required. ( 5.3 ) Adynamic Bone Disease : May develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection accordingly. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during Paricalcitol Injection treatment and may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D (i.e., all forms). Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Hypercalcemia may be so severe as to require emergency attention. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Prevention of such adverse reactions requires frequent serum calcium monitoring and careful Paricalcitol Injection dose adjustments. Concomitant use with other active vitamin D analogues should be avoided during Paricalcitol Injection treatment to prevent hypercalcemia. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Hypercalcemia of any cause increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using Paricalcitol Injection concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of Paricalcitol Injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. 5.3 Risk of Increased Paricalcitol Levels With Concomitant Use of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of Paricalcitol Injection with strong CYP3A inhibitors will increase the levels of paricalcitol in the blood. In patients on Paricalcitol Injection who are initiating or discontinuing therapy with drugs known to be strong CYP3A inhibitors, monitor serum calcium and PTH more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 5.4 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor PTH levels and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 5% and more frequent than placebo) include nausea, vomiting and edema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corp. at 1-877-233-2001 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety has been evaluated in clinical studies conducted with another paricalcitol injection product in 609 patients with CKD Stage 5. In four, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies, discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse event occurred in 6.5% of 62 patients treated with paricalcitol injection (dosage titrated as tolerated, [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]) and 2% of 51 patients treated with placebo for 1 to 3 months. Adverse reactions occurring with greater frequency in the paricalcitol group and at a frequency of 2% or greater are presented in the following table: Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring at a Rate A patient who reported the same medical term more than once was counted only once for that medical term. of 2% or Greater in CKD Stage 5 Patients in Four Placebo-Controlled Studies Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=51) % Paricalcitol Injection (n=62) % Cardiac Disorders Palpitations 0.0 3.2 Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 7.8 12.9 Vomiting 5.9 8.1 Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage 2.0 4.8 Dry Mouth 2.0 3.2 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Edema 0.0 6.5 Chills 2.0 4.8 Pyrexia 2.0 4.8 Malaise 0.0 3.2 Infections and Infestations Pneumonia 0.0 4.8 Sepsis 2.0 4.8 Influenza 3.9 4.8 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 3.9 4.8 Specific laboratory parameters [i.e., changes in mean Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium Phosphorus product (Ca \u00d7 P)] were followed in an open-label safety study conducted with another paricalcitol injection product for up to 13 months in duration in this patient population and results are shown below [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ]. Other Adverse Reactions Associated with Paricalcitol Injection Use The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of the paricalcitol-treated patients in the above mentioned double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials and in additional double-blind, active-controlled and open-label studies: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Anemia, lymphadenopathy Cardiac Disorders: Arrhythmia, atrial flutter, cardiac arrest Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Ear discomfort Endocrine Disorders: Hypoparathyroidism Eye Disorders: Conjunctivitis, glaucoma, ocular hyperemia Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, dysphagia, gastritis, intestinal ischemia, rectal hemorrhage General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Asthenia, chest discomfort, chest pain, condition aggravated, edema peripheral, fatigue, feeling abnormal, gait disturbance, injection site extravasation, injection site pain, pain, swelling, thirst Infections and Infestations: Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, vaginal infection Laboratory Investigations and Vital Signs: Increased aspartate aminotransferase, prolonged bleeding time, irregular heart rate, decreased weight Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Decreased appetite, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Joint stiffness, muscle twitching, myalgia Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified : Breast cancer Nervous System Disorders: Cerebrovascular accident, dizziness, dysgeusia, headache, hypoesthesia, myoclonus, paresthesia, syncope, unresponsive to stimuli Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation, confusional state, delirium, insomnia, nervousness, restlessness Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Breast pain, erectile dysfunction Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Cough, dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary edema, wheezing Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Alopecia, blister, hirsutism, night sweats, rash pruritic, pruritus, skin burning sensation Vascular Disorders: Hypertension, hypotension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of another paricalcitol injection product. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic reactions including rash, urticaria, and angioedema (including laryngeal edema) have been reported."

( 5.3 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Paricalcitol blood levels will be increased when paricalcitol is co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, monitor both PTH and serum calcium more frequently and adjust Paricalcitol Injection dose as required [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. ( 8.1 ) Nursing Mothers : A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Paricalcitol has been shown to cause minimal decreases in fetal viability (5%) when administered daily to rabbits at a dose 0.5 times the 0.24 mcg/kg human dose (based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) and when administered to rats at a dose 2 times the 0.24 mcg/kg human dose (based on plasma levels of exposure). At the highest dose tested (20 mcg/kg 3 times per week in rats, 13 times the 0.24 mcg/kg human dose based on surface area), there was a significant increase of the mortality of newborn rats at doses that were maternally toxic (hypercalcemia). No other effects on offspring development were observed. Paricalcitol was not teratogenic at the doses tested. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Paricalcitol Injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol is present in the milk. It is not known whether paricalcitol is excreted in human milk. In the nursing patient, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol injection were examined with another paricalcitol injection product in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 29 pediatric patients, aged 5-19 years, with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and nearly all had received some form of vitamin D prior to the study. Seventy-six percent of the patients were male, 52% were Caucasian and 45% were African-American. The initial dose of paricalcitol injection was 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week based on baseline iPTH level of less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg 3 times a week, based on baseline iPTH level of \u2265 500 pg/mL, respectively. The dose of paricalcitol injection was adjusted in 0.04 mcg/kg increments based on the levels of serum iPTH, calcium and Ca x P. The mean baseline levels of iPTH were 841 pg/mL for the 15 paricalcitol injection-treated patients and 740 pg/mL for the 14 placebo-treated subjects. The mean dose of paricalcitol injection administered was 4.6 mcg (range: 0.8 mcg-9.6 mcg). Ten of the 15 (67%) paricalcitol injection-treated patients and 2 of the 14 (14%) placebo-treated patients completed the trial. Ten of the placebo patients (71%) were discontinued due to excessive elevations in iPTH levels as defined by 2 consecutive iPTH levels > 700 pg/mL and greater than baseline after 4 weeks of treatment. In the primary efficacy analysis, 9 of 15 (60%) subjects in the paricalcitol injection group had 2 consecutive 30% decreases from baseline iPTH compared with 3 of 14 (21%) patients in the placebo group (95% CI for the difference between groups -1%, 63%). Twenty-three percent of paricalcitol injection vs. 31% of placebo patients had at least one serum calcium level > 10.3 mg/dL and 40% vs. 14% of paricalcitol injection vs. placebo subjects had at least one Ca x P ion product > 72 (mg/dL) 2 . The overall percentage of serum calcium measurements >10.3 mg/dL was 7% in the paricalcitol injection group and 7% in the placebo group; the overall percentage of patients with Ca x P product >72 (mg/dL) 2 was 8% in the paricalcitol injection group and 7% in the placebo group. No subjects in either the paricalcitol injection group or placebo group developed hypercalcemia (defined as at least one calcium value > 11.2 mg/dL) during the study. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of paricalcitol injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Paricalcitol has been shown to cause minimal decreases in fetal viability (5%) when administered daily to rabbits at a dose 0.5 times the 0.24 mcg/kg human dose (based on surface area, mg/m 2 ) and when administered to rats at a dose 2 times the 0.24 mcg/kg human dose (based on plasma levels of exposure). At the highest dose tested (20 mcg/kg 3 times per week in rats, 13 times the 0.24 mcg/kg human dose based on surface area), there was a significant increase of the mortality of newborn rats at doses that were maternally toxic (hypercalcemia). No other effects on offspring development were observed. Paricalcitol was not teratogenic at the doses tested. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Paricalcitol Injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Within two hours after administering paricalcitol intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 mcg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with three times a week dosing. Distribution : Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). In healthy subjects, the steady state volume of distribution is approximately 23.8 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is between 31 and 35 L. Metabolism : After intravenous administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces and no parent drug found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation (present at low levels in plasma), as well as 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination : Paricalcitol is excreted primarily by hepatobiliary excretion. Approximately 63% of a radioactive dose was recovered in the feces and 19% was recovered in the urine in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is about five to seven hours over the studied dose range of 0.04 to 0.16 mcg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol after administration of 0.24 mcg/kg paricalcitol intravenous bolus dose in CKD Stage 5 HD and PD patients is 13.9 and 15.4 hours, respectively (Table 3). Table 3: Mean \u00b1 SD Paricalcitol Pharmacokinetic Parameters in CKD Stage 5 Subjects Following Single 0.24 mcg/kg Intravenous Bolus Dose CKD Stage 5 HD n = 14 CKD Stage 5 PD n = 8 C max (ng/mL) 1.680 \u00b1 0.511 1.832 \u00b1 0.315 AUC 0-\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 14.51 \u00b1 4.12 16.01 \u00b1 5.98 \u03b2 (1/h) 0.050 \u00b1 0.023 0.045 \u00b1 0.026 t 1/2 (h) harmonic mean \u00b1 pseudo standard deviation, HD: hemodialysis, PD: peritoneal dialysis.

Pediatric : The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in patients less than 18 years of age. Gender : The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment : The disposition of intravenous paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n=5) and moderate (n=5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dosing adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis procedure has essentially no effect on paricalcitol elimination. However, compared to healthy subjects, CKD Stage 5 subjects showed a decreased CL and increased half-life. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL) (approximately 20-fold greater than that obtained after highest tested dose). In fresh primary cultured hepatocytes, the induction observed at paricalcitol concentrations up to 50 nM was less than two-fold for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A, where the positive controls rendered a six- to nineteen-fold induction. Hence, paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Drug interactions with Paricalcitol Injection have not been studied. The following studies have been performed with oral paricalcitol capsules. Omeprazole The pharmacokinetic interaction between paricalcitol capsule (16 mcg) and omeprazole (40 mg; oral), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was unaffected when omeprazole was administrated approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole Although no data are available for the drug interaction between Paricalcitol Injection and ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, the effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol capsule has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice conducted with paricalcitol, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats conducted with paricalcitol, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose [equivalent to 13 times the highest recommended human dose (0.24 mcg/kg) based on surface area, mg/m 2 ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES In three 12-week, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies conducted with another paricalcitol injection product in patients with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease on dialysis, the dose of paricalcitol was started at 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week. The dose was increased by 0.04 mcg/kg every 2 weeks until intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were decreased at least 30% from baseline, or a fifth escalation brought the dose to 0.24 mcg/kg, or iPTH fell to less than 100 pg/mL, or the Ca x P product was greater than 75 within any 2 week period, or serum calcium became greater than 11.5 mg/dL at any time. Patients treated with paricalcitol achieved a mean iPTH reduction of 30% within 6 weeks. In these studies, there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia between paricalcitol and placebo-treated patients. The results from these studies are as follows: Table 4: Mean Changes from Baseline to Final Evaluation in PTH, Alkaline Phosphatase, Phosphorus and Calcium x Phosphorus Product in CKD Stage 5 Patients in Three Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Studies Group (No. of Pts.)

Initial Dosage: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Dose three times a week.* * Not more frequently than every other day. CKD Stage 5: To avoid hypercalcemia only treat patients after their baseline serum calcium has been reduced to 9.5 mg/dL or lower (2.2). 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer paricalcitol capsules orally once daily or three times a week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Starting Dose Based upon Baseline iPTH Level Baseline iPTH Level Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dose* Less than or equal to 500 pg/mL 1 mcg 2 mcg More than 500 pg/mL 2 mcg 4 mcg *To be administered not more often than every other day Dose Titration Table 2. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Dose Titration Base upon iPTH Level Dose Adjustment at 2 to 4 Week Intervals iPTH Level Relative to Baseline Paricalcitol Capsule Dose Daily Dosage Three Times a Week Dosage* The same, increased or decreased by less than 30% Increase dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg Decreased by more than or equal to 30% and less than or equal to 60% Maintain dose - - Decreased by more than 60% or iPTH less than 60 pg/mL Decrease dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day If a patient is taking the lowest dose, 1 mcg, on the daily regimen and a dose reduction is needed, the dose can be decreased to 1 mcg three times a week. If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment ( 5.1 ). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds ( 5.2 ). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) ( 5.3 ). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. \u2022 Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution ( 7 ). \u2022 Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil ( 7 )."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug\u2011associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol, USP, the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules, is a synthetically manufactured, metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D 2 ) and the A (19-nor) ring. Paricalcitol is available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram, 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides, alcohol, and butylated hydroxytoluene. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide yellow (2 microgram and 4 microgram capsules), iron oxide black (1 microgram capsules only), and water. The capsules are printed with black ink composed of purified water, black iron oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Paricalcitol is a white, crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C 27 H 44 O 3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula:"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% - 13.0%) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 82% of the placebo-treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.

The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African- American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week's calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

Initial Dosage: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Pediatric: Ages 10 to 16 years Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 120. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Dose three times a week.* Pediatric: Ages 10 to 16 years Increase each dose by 1 mcg three times a week every 4 weeks or decrease each dose by 2 mcg three times a week at any time based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels.* * Not more frequently than every other day. CKD Stage 5: To avoid hypercalcemia only treat patients after their baseline serum calcium has been reduced to 9.5 mg/dL or lower ( 2.2 ). 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer paricalcitol capsules orally once daily or three times a week [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Starting Dose Based upon Baseline iPTH Level * To be administered not more often than every other day Baseline iPTH Level Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dose* Less than or equal to 500 pg/mL 1 mcg 2 mcg More than 500 pg/mL 2 mcg 4 mcg Dose Titration Table 2.

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol capsules based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol capsules dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/mL) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. 2.3 Pediatric Patients (Ages 10 to 16 Years) CKD Stages 3 and 4 Initial Dose Administer paricalcitol 1 mcg capsule orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day. Dose Titration Individualize and titrate paricalcitol capsules dose based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels to maintain an iPTH level within target range. Every 4 weeks, each administered paricalcitol capsules dose may be increased in 1 mcg increments, maintaining the three times per week regimen (e.g., increase from 1 mcg three times per week to 2 mcg three times per week). At any time, each administered dose may be decreased by 1 mcg. Paricalcitol capsules may be stopped if the patient requires reduction while receiving 1 mcg three times per week, resuming when appropriate. CKD Stage 5 Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose* (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 120 * Round down to the nearest whole number Dose Titration Subsequent dosing should be individualized and based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels to maintain an iPTH level within target range. Every 4 weeks, each administered paricalcitol capsules dose may be increased in 1 mcg increments, maintaining the three times per week regimen (e.g., increase from 1 mcg three times per week to 2 mcg three times per week). At any time, each administered dose may be decreased by 2 mcg. Paricalcitol capsules may be stopped if the patient requires reduction while receiving 2 mcg three times per week or 1 mcg three times per week, resuming when appropriate. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol capsules, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment (5.1) . Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2) . Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3) . Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4) . 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10) ] . Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

Includes only events more common in the paricalcitol treatment group. Additional Adverse Reactions The following additional adverse reactions occurred in <2% of the paricalcitol-treated patients in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Dry mouth Investigations: Hepatic enzyme abnormal Nervous System Disorders: Dysgeusia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Urticaria Pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in one multicenter clinical study involving CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients ages 10 to 16 years. A 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase was followed by an open-label phase during which all patients received paricalcitol capsules. During the 12-week blinded phase, a total of 18 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 18 patients received placebo. Adverse events occurring more frequently in the paricalcitol capsules group than in the placebo group are presented in Table 4. Table 4.

Includes only events more common in the paricalcitol treatment group. Additional Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions have occurred in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients: Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia Nervous System Disorders: Headache CKD Stage 5 Adults The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in one 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study involving 88 CKD Stage 5 patients. Sixty-one patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The proportion of patients who terminated prematurely from the study due to adverse events was 7% for paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 7% for placebo patients. Adverse events occurring in the paricalcitol capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are as follows: Table 5.

Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastroesophageal reflux disease Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Decreased appetite, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Breast tenderness Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Acne Pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in one 12-week, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical studies involving 13 CKD Stage 5 patients ages 10 to 16 years of age receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. The following adverse reactions were reported: Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia Three of 13 patients (23%) had hypercalcemia defined as at least 2 consecutive serum calcium values >10.2 mg/dL (2.55 mmol/L). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of paricalcitol capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders : Angioedema (including laryngeal edema) Investigations: Blood creatinine increased"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7) . Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil (7)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2) . 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules have been established in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with Stage 3, 4, and 5 CKD. Use of paricalcitol capsules in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies in adults with CKD, a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled randomized multicenter study in 36 pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age with CKD Stages 3 and 4, and safety data from a 12-week open-label single-arm multicenter study in 13 pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age with CKD Stage 5 receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol in Stage 5 CKD pediatric patients appear to be similar to those observed in Stage 3 and 4 pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adverse reactions reported in these pediatric studies are consistent with the known safety profile of paricalcitol capsules and with what has been reported in adult clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% to 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% to 1%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% to 84%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% to 13%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Pediatric Paricalcitol C max, AUC, and t 1/2 values were similar between Stage 3 and Stage 4 CKD pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age. Population pharmacokinetic analysis shows that the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol in Stage 5 CKD pediatric patients appear to be similar to those observed in Stage 3 and Stage 4 pediatric patients.

Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Pediatric Paricalcitol C max, AUC, and t 1/2 values were similar between Stage 3 and Stage 4 CKD pediatric patients 10 to 16 years of age. Population pharmacokinetic analysis shows that the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol in Stage 5 CKD pediatric patients appear to be similar to those observed in Stage 3 and Stage 4 pediatric patients.

Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 82% of the placebo treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 9. Table 9.

A total of 18 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 18 patients received placebo during the blinded phase of the study. The mean age of the patients was 13.6 years, 69% were male, 86% were Caucasian, and 8% were Asian. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was 1 mcg three times a week. Serum iPTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels were monitored every 2 to 4 weeks with a goal to maintain levels within target ranges: iPTH 35 to 70 pg/mL for CKD stage 3, iPTH 70 to 100 pg/mL for CKD stage 4, calcium < 10.2 mg/dL, phosphorous < 5.8 mg/dL. Starting at Treatment Week 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter, doses may have been increased in 1 mcg increments three times a week (e.g., increase from 1 mcg three times per week to 2 mcg three times per week) based upon safety observations and blood chemistry evaluations. Each administered dose could be decreased in 1 mcg increments three times a week, or held if the patient was receiving a 1 mcg dose, as appropriate at any time. The average cumulative weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 4 mcg/week during the 12 week blinded treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of Stage 3 and 4 patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline in iPTH levels, was statistically significant during the 12-week blinded phase. Results are shown in Table 10. Table 10. Changes in iPTH from Baseline in the CKD Stages 3 and 4 Pediatric Study a. The analysis treats 3 patients on paricalcitol and 1 patient on placebo with unknown response status as non-responders.

Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined 14.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in a Phase 3, 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study in patients with CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD. The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African- American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week\u2019s calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

Initial Dosage: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Dose three times a week.* * Not more frequently than every other day. CKD Stage 5: To avoid hypercalcemia only treat patients after their baseline serum calcium has been reduced to 9.5 mg/dL or lower (2.2). 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer paricalcitol capsules orally once daily or three times a week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1.

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment ( 5.1 ). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds ( 5.2 ). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) ( 5.3 ). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitivity, nausea, and edema ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience CKD Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in three 24-week (approximately six\u2011month), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical studies involving 220 CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Six percent (6%) of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 4% of placebo-treated patients discontinued from clinical studies due to an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in the paricalcitol capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are presented in Table 3: Table 3.

Includes only events more common in the paricalcitol treatment group. Additional Adverse Reactions The following additional adverse reactions occurred in <2% of the paricalcitol-treated adult patients in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Dry mouth Investigations: Hepatic enzyme abnormal Nervous System Disorders: Dysgeusia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Urticaria Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. CKD Stage 5 Adults The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in one 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study involving 88 CKD Stage 5 patients. Sixty-one patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The proportion of patients who terminated prematurely from the study due to adverse events was 7% for paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 7% for placebo patients. Adverse events occurring in the paricalcitol capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are as follows: Table 5.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. \u2022 Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution ( 7 ). \u2022 Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug\u2011associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol, USP, the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules, is a synthetically manufactured, metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D 2 ) and the A (19-nor) ring. Paricalcitol is available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram, 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides, alcohol, and butylated hydroxytoluene. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide yellow (2 microgram and 4 microgram capsules), iron oxide black (1 microgram capsules only), and water. The capsules are printed with black ink composed of purified water, black iron oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Paricalcitol is a white, crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C 27 H 44 O 3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula:"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% - 13.0%) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 82% of the placebo-treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 9.

However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 14.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in a Phase 3, 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study in patients with CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD. The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African- American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week's calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ensure serum calcium is not above the upper limit of normal before initiating ( 2.1 ) Administer paricalcitol injection intravenously through a hemodialysis vascular access at any time during dialysis ( 2.1 ). Adult Dose : Initiate at 0.04 mcg/kg to 0.1 mcg/kg (2.8 mcg to 7 mcg) no more frequently than every other day ( 2.2 ). Target maintenance dose to intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits ( 2.2 ). Monitor serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and intact PTH levels every 2 to 4 weeks after dose initiation or adjustment ( 2.2 ). See Table 1 in the full prescribing information for titration recommendations based upon intact PTH levels ( 2.2 ). Suspend or decrease the dose for persistent abnormally low intact PTH or serum calcium consistently above the normal range ( 2.2 ). Pediatric Dose : Initiate paricalcitol injection as an intravenous bolus dose of: 0.04 mcg/kg if baseline intact PTH is less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg if baseline intact PTH is 500 pg/mL or greater ( 2.3 ) Target maintenance dose to intact PTH levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits ( 2.3 ). Monitor serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and intact PTH levels every 2 to 4 weeks after dose initiation or adjustment ( 2.3 ). See Table 2 in the full prescribing information for titration recommendations based upon intact PTH levels ( 2.3 ). Suspend or decrease the dose for persistent abnormally low intact PTH or serum calcium consistently above the normal range ( 2.3 ). 2.1 Important Administration Information Ensure serum calcium is not above the upper limit of normal before initiating treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Administer paricalcitol injection intravenously through a hemodialysis vascular access port at any time during dialysis. Paricalcitol injection may be administered intravenously if an access port is unavailable. Inspect paricalcitol injection visually prior to administration; the solution should appear clear and colorless. Do not use if the solution is not clear or particles are present. Discard unused portion of 2 mcg/mL and 5 mcg/mL single-dose vials. 2.2 Starting Dose and Dose Titration in Adults Initiate paricalcitol injection as an intravenous bolus dose of 0.04 mcg/kg to 0.1 mcg/kg (2.8 mcg to 7 mcg) no more frequently than every other day at any time during dialysis. Target the maintenance dose of paricalcitol injection to intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits. Monitor serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and intact PTH levels every 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy or dose adjustment. Titrate the dose of paricalcitol injection based on intact PTH (see Table 1). Prior to raising the dose, ensure serum calcium is within normal limits. The maximum daily adult dose is 0.24 mcg/kg. Suspend or decrease the dose if intact PTH is persistently and abnormally low to reduce the risk of adynamic bone disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or if serum calcium is consistently above the normal range to reduce the risk of hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . If dose suspension is necessary, restart at a reduced dose after laboratory values have normalized. Table 1.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia : Can occur during treatment with paricalcitol and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention. The risk may be increased when paricalcitol is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D compounds. Inform patients about symptoms of hypercalcemia and monitor serum calcium prior to initiation and during treatment and adjust dose accordingly ( 2 , 5.1 ). Digitalis toxicity : Risk increases with hypercalcemia. In patients using digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Monitor more frequently when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol ( 5.2 ). Adynamic Bone Disease : May develop and increase risk of fractures if intact PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels and adjust dose if needed ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during paricalcitol treatment. Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention. Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or other vitamin D compounds [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. In addition, high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy may be at increased risk for development of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol. In these circumstances, frequent serum calcium monitoring and paricalcitol dose adjustments may be required. When initiating paricalcitol or adjusting paricalcitol dose, measure serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly). Once a maintenance dose has been established, measure serum calcium at least monthly . If hypercalcemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue paricalcitol until serum calcium is normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] . Inform patients about the symptoms of elevated calcium (feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss) and instruct them to report new or worsening symptoms when they occur. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Paricalcitol can cause hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using paricalcitol concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if intact PTH levels are suppressed by paricalcitol to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid over suppression and adjust paricalcitol dose, if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Adynamic Bone Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) are nausea, vomiting and edema ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eugia US LLC at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Four placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies were conducted in 113 patients (51% male, 10% Caucasian, 81% African-American and 9% Hispanic, ranging in age from 18 to 90 years). Sixty-two patients were exposed to paricalcitol and the average dose at the end of treatment was 0.12 mcg/kg/dose with a mean number of 55 days of dosing across the studies. Discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse reaction occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with paricalcitol and 2.0% of patients treated with placebo. Adverse reactions occurring with greater frequency in the paricalcitol group and at a frequency of 2% or greater are presented in Table 3. Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic reactions, such as rash, urticaria, and angioedema (including laryngeal edema) have been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol. Table 4. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol Drugs that May Increase the risk of Hypercalcemia Clinical Impact Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or other vitamin D compounds may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Thiazide diuretics are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine. Examples Calcium-containing products, other vitamin D compounds or thiazide diuretics Intervention Monitor calcium more frequently and adjust paricalcitol dose as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Digitalis Compounds Clinical Impact Paricalcitol can cause hypercalcemia which can potentiate the risk of digitalis toxicity. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of serum calcium monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol in patients receiving digitalis compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Examples Boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole Intervention If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, dose adjustment of paricalcitol may be necessary. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases paricalcitol exposure. Dose adjustment may be necessary. Closely monitor intact PTH and serum calcium ( 2.4 , 7 )."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 14 mcg (equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg), based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the risk for maternal hypertension and preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm delivery, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight infants. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by intravenous injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3 or 20 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data) . Infants exposed to paricalcitol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for paricalcitol and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from paricalcitol or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to paricalcitol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, including seizures, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. Monitoring of serum calcium in the infant should be considered. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with CKD have been established in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older with CKD on dialysis. Use of paricalcitol in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 29 patients, 5 to 19 years of age, with CKD on hemodialysis [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol have not been established in pediatric patients less than 5 years old. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of paricalcitol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were studied in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and were similar to that of patients with normal hepatic function. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic function. Paricalcitol has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol\u2019s biological actions are mediated through binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Within two hours after administering paricalcitol intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 to 0.24 mcg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with three times a week dosing. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u226599.8%). In healthy subjects, the steady state volume of distribution is approximately 23.8 L. The mean volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is between 31 and 35 L. Elimination Metabolism After intravenous administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces and no parent drug found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation (present at low levels in plasma), as well as 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Excretion Paricalcitol is excreted primarily by hepatobiliary excretion. Approximately 63% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the feces and 19% was recovered in the urine in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is about five to seven hours over the studied dose range of 0.04 to 0.16 mcg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol after administration of 0.24 mcg/kg paricalcitol IV bolus dose in CKD HD and PD patients is 13.9 and 15.4 hours, respectively (Table 5). Table 5.

The degree of accumulation was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric and pediatric patients. Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were gender independent. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n=5) and moderate (n=5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol were similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol have been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis procedure has essentially no effect on paricalcitol elimination. However, compared to healthy subjects, CKD patients on dialysis showed a decreased CL and increased half-life. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL) (approximately 20-fold greater than that obtained after highest tested dose). In fresh primary cultured hepatocytes, the induction observed at paricalcitol concentrations up to 50 nM was less than two-fold for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A, where the positive controls rendered a six- to nineteen-fold induction. Hence, paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Drug interactions with paricalcitol injection have not been studied. The following studies have been performed with oral paricalcitol capsules. Omeprazole The pharmacokinetic interaction between paricalcitol capsule (16 mcg) and omeprazole (40 mg; oral), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were unaffected when omeprazole was administrated approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days, on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol capsule has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult Studies in CKD on Dialysis Three 12-week, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 78 patients with CKD on hemodialysis. In these studies, patients ranged in age from 22 to 90 years, 51% were males, 13% were Caucasian, 79% were African-American, and 8% were Hispanic. The most common causes of renal failure were hypertension and diabetes. The dose of paricalcitol was started at 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week intravenously. The dose was increased by 0.04 mcg/kg every 2 weeks until intact PTH levels were decreased at least 30% from baseline or a fifth escalation brought the dose to 0.24 mcg/kg, or intact PTH fell to less than 100 pg/mL, or the Ca \u00d7 P product was greater than 75 within any 2 week period, or serum calcium became greater than 11.5 mg/dL at any time. Patients treated with paricalcitol achieved a mean intact PTH reduction of 30% within 6 weeks. The results from these studies are as follows: Table 6.

Of the 29 patients, 76% were male, 52% were Caucasian and 45% were African-American. The initial dose of paricalcitol was 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of 500 pg/mL or greater. The dose of paricalcitol was adjusted in 0.04 mcg/kg increments based on the levels of serum intact PTH, calcium and Ca \u00d7 P. The mean baseline levels of intact PTH were 841 pg/mL for the 15 paricalcitol-treated patients and 740 pg/mL for the 14 placebo-treated patients. The mean dose of paricalcitol administered was 4.6 mcg (range: 0.8 mcg to 9.6 mcg). Sixty-seven percent of the paricalcitol-treated patients and 14% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial. Seventy- one percent of the placebo-treated patients discontinued due to excessive elevations in intact PTH levels, as defined by 2 consecutive intact PTH levels greater than 700 pg/mL and greater than baseline after 4 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated that 60% of paricalcitol-treated patients and 21% of placebo-treated patients achieved two consecutive greater than or equal to 30% reductions from baseline in intact PTH."

Initial Dosage: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Dose three times a week.* * Not more frequently than every other day. CKD Stage 5: To avoid hypercalcemia only treat patients after their baseline serum calcium has been reduced to 9.5 mg/dL or lower (2.2). 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer paricalcitol capsules orally once daily or three times a week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1.

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment ( 5.1 ). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds ( 5.2 ). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) ( 5.3 ). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitivity, nausea, and edema ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience CKD Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in three 24-week (approximately six\u2011month), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical studies involving 220 CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Six percent (6%) of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 4% of placebo-treated patients discontinued from clinical studies due to an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in the paricalcitol capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are presented in Table 3: Table 3.

CKD Stage 5 Adults The safety of paricalcitol capsules has been evaluated in one 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study involving 88 CKD Stage 5 patients. Sixty-one patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The proportion of patients who terminated prematurely from the study due to adverse events was 7% for paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 7% for placebo patients. Adverse events occurring in the paricalcitol capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are as follows: Table 5.

Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. \u2022 Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution ( 7 ). \u2022 Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug\u2011associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol, USP, the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules, is a synthetically manufactured, metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D 2 ) and the A (19-nor) ring. Paricalcitol is available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram, 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides, alcohol, and butylated hydroxytoluene. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide yellow (2 microgram and 4 microgram capsules), iron oxide black (1 microgram capsules only), and water. The capsules are printed with black ink composed of purified water, black iron oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Paricalcitol is a white, crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C 27 H 44 O 3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula: Structural Formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% - 13.0%) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 82% of the placebo-treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 9.

Figure 1 14.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in a Phase 3, 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study in patients with CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD. The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African- American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week's calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

( 2.2 ) Target maintenance dose to intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits. ( 2.2 ) Monitor serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and intact PTH levels every 2 to 4 weeks after dose initiation or adjustment. ( 2.2 ) See Table 1 in the full prescribing information for titration recommendations based upon intact PTH levels. ( 2.2 ) Suspend or decrease the dose for persistent abnormally low intact PTH or serum calcium consistently above the normal range. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric Dose: Initiate paricalcitol injection as an intravenous bolus dose of: 0.04 mcg/kg if baseline intact PTH is less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg if baseline intact PTH is 500 pg/mL or greater. ( 2.3 ) Target maintenance dose to intact PTH levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits. ( 2.3 ) Monitor serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and intact PTH levels every 2 to 4 weeks after dose initiation or adjustment. ( 2.3 ) See Table 2 in the full prescribing information for titration recommendations based upon intact PTH levels. ( 2.3 ) Suspend or decrease the dose for persistent abnormally low intact PTH or serum calcium consistently above the normal range. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Important Administration Information Ensure serum calcium is not above the upper limit of normal before initiating treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Administer paricalcitol injection intravenously through a hemodialysis vascular access port at any time during dialysis. Paricalcitol injection may be administered intravenously if an access port is unavailable. Inspect paricalcitol injection visually prior to administration; the solution should appear clear and colorless. Do not use if the solution is not clear or particles are present. Discard unused portion of 2 mcg/mL and 5 mcg/mL single-dose vials. 2.2 Starting Dose and Dose Titration in Adults Initiate paricalcitol injection as an intravenous bolus dose of 0.04 mcg/kg to 0.1 mcg/kg (2.8 mcg to 7 mcg) no more frequently than every other day at any time during dialysis. Target the maintenance dose of paricalcitol injection to intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels within the desired therapeutic range and serum calcium within normal limits. Monitor serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly) and intact PTH levels every 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy or dose adjustment. Titrate the dose of paricalcitol injection based on intact PTH (see Table 1). Prior to raising the dose, ensure serum calcium is within normal limits. The maximum daily adult dose is 0.24 mcg/kg. Suspend or decrease the dose if intact PTH is persistently and abnormally low to reduce the risk of adynamic bone disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] or if serum calcium is consistently above the normal range to reduce the risk of hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypercalcemia: Can occur during treatment with paricalcitol and can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention. The risk may be increased when paricalcitol is used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations, thiazide diuretics, or vitamin D compounds. Inform patients about symptoms of hypercalcemia and monitor serum calcium prior to initiation and during treatment and adjust dose accordingly. ( 2 , 5.1 ) Digitalis toxicity: Risk increases with hypercalcemia. In patients using digitalis compounds, monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Monitor more frequently when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol. ( 5.2 ) Adynamic Bone Disease: May develop and increase risk of fractures if intact PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels and adjust dose if needed. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during paricalcitol treatment. Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention. Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations, thiazide diuretics, or other vitamin D compounds [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . In addition, high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia. Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy may be at increased risk for development of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol. In these circumstances, frequent serum calcium monitoring and paricalcitol dose adjustments may be required. When initiating paricalcitol or adjusting paricalcitol dose, measure serum calcium frequently (e.g., twice weekly). Once a maintenance dose has been established, measure serum calcium at least monthly. If hypercalcemia occurs, reduce the dose or discontinue paricalcitol until serum calcium is normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] . Inform patients about the symptoms of elevated calcium (feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss) and instruct them to report new or worsening symptoms when they occur. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Paricalcitol can cause hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. In patients using paricalcitol concomitantly with digitalis compounds, monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity. Increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . 5.3 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if intact PTH levels are suppressed by paricalcitol to abnormally low levels. Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid over suppression and adjust paricalcitol dose, if needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypercalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Adynamic Bone Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) are nausea, vomiting and edema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Four placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies were conducted in 113 patients (51% male, 10% Caucasian, 81% African-American and 9% Hispanic, ranging in age from 18 to 90 years). Sixty-two patients were exposed to paricalcitol and the average dose at the end of treatment was 0.12 mcg/kg/dose with a mean number of 55 days of dosing across the studies. Discontinuation of therapy due to any adverse reaction occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with paricalcitol and 2% of patients treated with placebo. Adverse reactions occurring with greater frequency in the paricalcitol group and at a frequency of 2% or greater are presented in Table 3.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol. Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol Drugs that May Increase the risk of Hypercalcemia Clinical Impact Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or other vitamin D compounds may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Thiazide diuretics are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine. Examples Calcium-containing products, other vitamin D compounds or thiazide diuretics Intervention Monitor calcium more frequently and adjust paricalcitol dose as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Digitalis Compounds Clinical Impact Paricalcitol can cause hypercalcemia which can potentiate the risk of digitalis toxicity. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of serum calcium monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of paricalcitol in patients receiving digitalis compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Examples Boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole Intervention If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, dose adjustment of paricalcitol may be necessary. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) increases paricalcitol exposure. Dose adjustment may be necessary. Closely monitor intact PTH and serum calcium. ( 2.4 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 14 mcg (equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg), based on body surface area (mcg/m 2 ). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the risk for maternal hypertension and preeclampsia, miscarriage, preterm delivery, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight infants. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mcg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by intravenous injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3 or 20 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times a human dose of 0.24 mcg/kg, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data) . Infants exposed to paricalcitol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia (see Clinical Considerations) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for paricalcitol and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from paricalcitol or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to paricalcitol through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, including seizures, vomiting, constipation and weight loss. Monitoring of serum calcium in the infant should be considered. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with CKD have been established in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older with CKD on dialysis. Use of paricalcitol in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older is supported by evidence from an adequate and well-controlled study in 29 patients, 5 to 19 years of age, with CKD on hemodialysis [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol have not been established in pediatric patients less than 5 years old. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of paricalcitol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were studied in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and were similar to that of patients with normal hepatic function. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic function. Paricalcitol has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment."

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Within two hours after administering paricalcitol intravenous doses ranging from 0.04 mcg/kg to 0.24 mcg/kg, concentrations of paricalcitol decreased rapidly; thereafter, concentrations of paricalcitol declined log-linearly. No accumulation of paricalcitol was observed with three times a week dosing. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). In healthy subjects, the steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 23.8 L. The mean volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 5 subjects requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) is between 31 and 35 L. Elimination Metabolism After intravenous administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces and no parent drug found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation (present at low levels in plasma), as well as 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Excretion Paricalcitol is excreted primarily by hepatobiliary excretion. Approximately 63% of the radioactivity was eliminated in the feces and 19% was recovered in the urine in healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is about five to seven hours over the studied dose range of 0.04 mcg/kg to 0.16 mcg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol after administration of 0.24 mcg/kg paricalcitol intravenous (IV) bolus dose in CKD HD and PD patients is 13.9 and 15.4 hours, respectively (Table 5). Table 5: Mean \u00b1 SD Paricalcitol Pharmacokinetic Parameters in CKD Patients on Dialysis Following Single 0.24 mcg/kg Intravenous Bolus Dose CKD \u2013HD (n=14) CKD \u2013PD (n=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.680 \u00b1 0.511 1.832 \u00b1 0.315 AUC 0-\u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14.51 \u00b1 4.12 16.01 \u00b1 5.98 \u03b2 (1/h) 0.050 \u00b1 0.023 0.045 \u00b1 0.026 t 1/2 (h) * 13.9 \u00b1 7.3 15.4 \u00b1 10.5 CL (L/h) 1.49 \u00b1 0.60 1.54 \u00b1 0.95 Vd\u03b2 (L) 30.8 \u00b1 7.5 34.9 \u00b1 9.5 * harmonic mean \u00b1 pseudo standard deviation, HD: hemodialysis, PD: peritoneal dialysis. The degree of accumulation was consistent with the half-life and dosing frequency. Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric and pediatric patients. Male and Female Patients The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were gender independent. Patients with Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n=5) and moderate (n=5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol were similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol have been studied in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis procedure has essentially no effect on paricalcitol elimination. However, compared to healthy subjects, CKD patients on dialysis showed a decreased CL and increased half-life. Drug Interaction Studies An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A at concentrations up to 50 nM (21 ng/mL) (approximately 20-fold greater than that obtained after highest tested dose). In fresh primary cultured hepatocytes, the induction observed at paricalcitol concentrations up to 50 nM was less than two-fold for CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A, where the positive controls rendered a six- to nineteen-fold induction. Hence, paricalcitol is not expected to inhibit or induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Drug interactions with paricalcitol injection have not been studied. The following studies have been performed with oral paricalcitol capsules. Omeprazole The pharmacokinetic interaction between paricalcitol capsule (16 mcg) and omeprazole (40 mg; oral), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol were unaffected when omeprazole was administrated approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days, on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol capsule has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult Studies in CKD on Dialysis Three 12-week, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 78 patients with CKD on hemodialysis. In these studies, patients ranged in age from 22 to 90 years, 51% were males, 13% were Caucasian, 79% were African-American, and 8% were Hispanic. The most common causes of renal failure were hypertension and diabetes. The dose of paricalcitol was started at 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week intravenously. The dose was increased by 0.04 mcg/kg every 2 weeks until intact PTH levels were decreased at least 30% from baseline or a fifth escalation brought the dose to 0.24 mcg/kg, or intact PTH fell to less than 100 pg/mL, or the Ca \u00d7 P product was greater than 75 within any 2 week period, or serum calcium became greater than 11.5 mg/dL at any time. Patients treated with paricalcitol achieved a mean intact PTH reduction of 30% within 6 weeks.

Of the 29 patients, 76% were male, 52% were Caucasian and 45% were African-American. The initial dose of paricalcitol was 0.04 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of less than 500 pg/mL, or 0.08 mcg/kg 3 times per week, based on baseline intact PTH level of 500 pg/mL or greater. The dose of paricalcitol was adjusted in 0.04 mcg/kg increments based on the levels of serum intact PTH, calcium and Ca \u00d7 P. The mean baseline levels of intact PTH were 841 pg/mL for the 15 paricalcitol-treated patients and 740 pg/mL for the 14 placebo-treated patients. The mean dose of paricalcitol administered was 4.6 mcg (range: 0.8 mcg to 9.6 mcg). Sixty-seven percent of the paricalcitol-treated patients and 14% of the placebo-treated patients completed the trial. Seventy-one percent of the placebo-treated patients discontinued due to excessive elevations in intact PTH levels, as defined by 2 consecutive intact PTH levels greater than 700 pg/mL and greater than baseline after 4 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated that 60% of paricalcitol-treated patients and 21% of placebo-treated patients achieved two consecutive greater than or equal to 30% reductions from baseline in intact PTH."

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol capsules based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol capsules dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol capsules, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment (5.1). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2) . Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. . Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification.Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with Zemplar may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole,lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7) . Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil (7) ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2 ). Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug- associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3 or 20 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol USP, the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules, is a synthetically manufactured, metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D 2 ) and the A (19-nor) ring. Paricalcitol capsules are available as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram, 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains butylated hydroxytoluene, dehydrated ethanol, medium chain triglycerides and polyoxyl 35 castor oil. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide. The gelatin solution is composed of gelatin (210 bloom), red iron oxide (for 1 micrograms and 2 micrograms), yellow iron oxide (for 2 micrograms and 4 micrograms) and polysorbate 80. Paricalcitol is a white to almost white powder with the molecular formula of C 27 H 44 O 3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula:"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH- based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% to 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% to 1%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% to 84%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% to 13%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers subjects was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-\u00ad dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol Capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 82% of the placebo treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 9.

However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 14.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in a Phase 3, 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study in patients with CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD. The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African-American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216-1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week\u2019s calculation of iPTH/60. paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol capsules based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol capsules dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol capsules, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment (5.1) . Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2) . Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3) . Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4) . 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10) ] . Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitivity, nausea, and edema (6) .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7) . Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil (7) ."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2) . Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1 or 3 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3 or 20 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data ] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% to 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% to 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% to 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% to 13.0%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 82% of the placebo treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 9.

Figure 1 14.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in a Phase 3, 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter study in patients with CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD. The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African-American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week\u2019s calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] .

Initial Dosage: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Administer dose orally three times a week.* Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 ( 2.2 ) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels. Dose three times a week.* * Not more frequently than every other day. CKD Stage 5: To avoid hypercalcemia only treat patients after their baseline serum calcium has been reduced to 9.5 mg/dL or lower (2.2). 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer paricalcitol capsules orally once daily or three times a week [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Starting Dose Based upon Baseline iPTH Level Baseline iPTH Level Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dose* Less than or equal to 500 pg/mL 1 mcg 2 mcg More than 500 pg/mL 2 mcg 4 mcg *To be administered not more often than every other day Dose Titration Table 2. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Dose Titration Base upon iPTH Level Dose Adjustment at 2 to 4 Week Intervals iPTH Level Relative to Baseline Paricalcitol Capsule Dose Daily Dosage Three Times a Week Dosage* The same, increased or decreased by less than 30% Increase dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg Decreased by more than or equal to 30% and less than or equal to 60% Maintain dose - - Decreased by more than 60% or iPTH less than 60 pg/mL Decrease dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day If a patient is taking the lowest dose, 1 mcg, on the daily regimen and a dose reduction is needed, the dose can be decreased to 1 mcg three times a week. If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of paricalcitol capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day based upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Dose Titration Individualize the dose of paricalcitol based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus levels. Titrate paricalcitol dose based on the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio (e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of paricalcitol, during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of paricalcitol should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol capsules may be taken without regard to food."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment ( 5.1 ). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds ( 5.2 ). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) ( 5.3 ). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 6 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with paricalcitol capsules. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. \u2022 Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution ( 7 ). \u2022 Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil ( 7 )."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8.2 ). Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s ZEMPLAR (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug\u2011associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data] . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [ 3 H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [ 3 H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to [ 3 H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n = 88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of paricalcitol capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Paricalcitol, USP, the active ingredient in paricalcitol capsules, is a synthetically manufactured, metabolically active vitamin D analog of calcitriol with modifications to the side chain (D 2 ) and the A (19-nor) ring. Paricalcitol is available as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 1 microgram, 2 micrograms or 4 micrograms of paricalcitol. Each capsule also contains medium chain triglycerides, alcohol, and butylated hydroxytoluene. The medium chain triglycerides are fractionated from coconut oil or palm kernel oil. The capsule shell is composed of gelatin, glycerin, titanium dioxide, iron oxide red (2 microgram capsules only), iron oxide yellow (2 microgram and 4 microgram capsules), iron oxide black (1 microgram capsules only), and water. The capsules are printed with black ink composed of purified water, black iron oxide, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and hypromellose. Paricalcitol is a white, crystalline powder with the empirical formula of C 27 H 44 O 3 , which corresponds to a molecular weight of 416.64. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1\u03b1,3\u03b2,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene and has the following structural formula:"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% - 13.0%) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of paricalcitol capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3, 4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC 0-\u221e approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, an increased incidence of uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma was observed at subcutaneous doses of 1, 3, 10 mcg/kg given three times weekly (2 to 15 times the AUC at a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The incidence rate of uterine leiomyoma was significantly different than the control group at the highest dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at subcutaneous doses of 0.15, 0.5, 1.5 mcg/kg (< 1 to 7 times the exposure following a human dose of 14 mcg, equivalent to 0.24 mcg/kg based on AUC). The increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be related to the alteration of calcium homeostasis by paricalcitol. Paricalcitol did not exhibit genetic toxicity in vitro with or without metabolic activation in the microbial mutagenesis assay (Ames Assay), mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay (L5178Y), or a human lymphocyte cell chromosomal aberration assay. There was also no evidence of genetic toxicity in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Paricalcitol had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mcg/kg/dose (equivalent to 13 times a human dose of 14 mcg based on surface area, mcg/m 2 )."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145 to 856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, paricalcitol capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of paricalcitol capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to < 60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased < 30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was > 5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the paricalcitol capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 82% of the placebo-treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the paricalcitol capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in paricalcitol capsules-treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 9.

The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received paricalcitol capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African- American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline serum iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216 to 1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of paricalcitol capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week's calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline serum iPTH was 88% of paricalcitol capsules-treated patients and 13% of the placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL) in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with paricalcitol capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ].

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer Paricalcitol Capsules orally once daily or three times a week. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Starting Dose Based upon Baseline iPTH Level Baseline iPTH Level Daily Dose Three Times a Week Dose* Less than or equal to 500 pg/mL 1 mcg 2 mcg More than 500 pg/mL 2 mcg 4 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day Dose Titration Table 2. Recommended Paricalcitol Capsules Dose Titration Base upon iPTH Level Dose Adjustment at 2 to 4 Week Intervals iPTH Level Relative to Baseline Paricalcitol Capsule Dose Daily Dosage Three Times a Week Dosage* The same, increased or decreased by less than 30% Increase dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg Decreased by more than or equal to 30% and less than or equal to 60% Maintain dose - - Decreased by more than 60% or iPTH less than 60 pg/mL Decrease dose by 1 mcg 2 mcg * To be administered not more often than every other day If a patient is taking the lowest dose, 1 mcg, on the daily regimen and a dose reduction is needed, the dose can be decreased to 1 mcg three times a week. If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Dose Titration Individualize the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus level. Titrate Paricalcitol Capsules dose based on following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio ((e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of Paricalcitol Capsules during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol Capsules may be taken without regard to food. Initial Dosage:CKD Stage 3 and 4 (2.1) Adult:Baseline iPTH \u2264 500 pg/mL 1 mcg orally daily or 2 mcg three times a week* Adult: Baseline iPTH > 500 pg/mL 2 mcg orally daily or 4 mcg three times a week* Dose Titration : CKD Stage 3 and 4 (2.1) Adult : iPTH same, increased or decreased by <30% relative to baseline Increase dose by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week* Adult : iPTH decreased by \u2265 30% and \u2264 60% relative to baseline Maintain dose Adult : iPTH decreased by > 60% or iPTH < 60% pg/mL relative to baseline Decrease dose by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week* *Not more frequently than every other day when dosing three times a week Initial dosage : CKD Stage 5 (2.2) Adult Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds. including Paricalcitol Capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. 5.1 Hypercalcemia Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [ see Overdosage (10) ] . Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diueretics with Paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia. 5.2 Digitalis Toxicity Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Paricalcitol Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds. 5.3 Laboratory Tests During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter. In pre-dialysis patients, Paricalcitol Capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol. 5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with Paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur. Hypercalcemia: Excessive administration of Paricalcitol Capsules can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease. Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during Paricalcitol treatment (5.1). Digitalis toxicity: Potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when Paricalcitol Capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds (5.2). Laboratory tests: Monitor serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH during initial dosing or following any dose adjustment. Paricalcitol Capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR) (5.3). Aluminum overload and toxicity: Avoid excessive use of aluminum containing compounds (5.4)."

Includes only events more common in the Paricalcitol treatment group. Additional Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions, occurred in <2% of the Paricalcitol Capsules- treated patients in the above double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastroesophageal reflux disease Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Decreased appetite, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : Breast tenderness Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Acne Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of Paricalcitol Capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Angioedema (including laryngeal edema) Investigations: Blood creatinine increased The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitity, nausea, and edema (6).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 5 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with Paricalcitol capsules. Table 5: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of Paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take Paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take Paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7). Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least one hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil (7)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended (8.2). 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with Paricalcitol capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug- associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations] . In animal reproduction studies, slightly increased embryofetal loss was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits administered paricalcitol intravenously during the period of organogenesis at doses 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Adverse reproductive outcomes were observed at doses that caused maternal toxicity [see Data] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for hypertension, spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. Chronic kidney disease increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), prematurity, polyhydramnios, still birth, and low birth weight. Data Animal Data Pregnant rats and rabbits were treated with paricalcitol by once-daily intravenous (IV) injection during the period of organogenesis (in rats, from gestation day (GD) 6 to 17; in rabbits, from GD 6 to 18). Rats were dosed at 0, 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mcg/kg/day and rabbits at 0, 0.03, 0.1 or 0.3 mcg/kg/day, representing up to 2 or 0.5 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.24 mcg/kg, based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ). Slightly decreased fetal viability was observed in both studies at the highest doses representing 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight and food consumption). Pregnant rats were administered paricalcitol by IV injection three times per week at doses of 0, 0.3, 3.0 or 20.0 mcg/kg/day throughout gestation, parturition and lactation (GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20) representing exposures up to 13 times the MHRD. A small increase in stillbirths and pup deaths from parturition to LD 4 were observed at the high dose when compared to the control group (9.2% versus 3.3% in controls) at 13 times the MRHD, which occurred at a maternally toxic dose known to cause hypercalcemia in rats. Surviving pups were not adversely affected; body weight gains, developmental landmarks, reflex ontogeny, learning indices, and locomotor activity were all within normal parameters. F1 reproductive capacity was unaffected. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of paricalcitol in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Studies in rats have shown that paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are present in the milk of lactating rats; however, due to specifies-specific differences in lactation physiology, animal data may not reliably predict drug levels in human milk [see Data]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypercalcemia in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Paricalcitol. Data Following a single oral administration of 20 mcg/kg of radioactive [3H] paricalcitol to lactating rats, the concentrations of total radioactivity was determined. Lower levels of total radioactivity were present in the milk compared to that in the plasma of the dams indicating that low levels of [3H] paricalcitol and/or its metabolites are secreted into milk. Exposure of the pups to[3H] paricalcitol through milk was confirmed by the presence of radioactive material in the pups\u2019 stomachs. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Paricalcitol Capsules in pediatric patients under the age of 10 years have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number (n = 220) of CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients in clinical studies of Paricalcitol capsules, 49% were age 65 and over, while 17% were age 75 and over. Of the total number (n =88) of CKD Stage 5 patients in the pivotal study of Paricalcitol Capsules, 28% were age 65 and over, while 6% were age 75 and over. No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive administration of Paricalcitol Capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Treatment of Overdosage The treatment of acute overdosage of Paricalcitol Capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) associated with inadequate levels of active vitamin D hormone. The source of vitamin D in the body is from synthesis in the skin as vitamin D 3 and from dietary intake as either vitamin D 2 or D 3 . Both vitamin D 2 and D 3 require two sequential hydroxylations in the liver and the kidney to bind to and to activate the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The endogenous VDR activator, calcitriol [1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ], is a hormone that binds to VDRs that are present in the parathyroid gland, intestine, kidney, and bone to maintain parathyroid function and calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, and to VDRs found in many other tissues, including prostate, endothelium and immune cells. VDR activation is essential for the proper formation and maintenance of normal bone. In the diseased kidney, the activation of vitamin D is diminished, resulting in a rise of PTH, subsequently leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and disturbances in the calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 have been observed in early stages of chronic kidney disease. The decreased levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 and resultant elevated PTH levels, both of which often precede abnormalities in serum calcium and phosphorus, affect bone turnover rate and may result in renal osteodystrophy. 12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% -13.0%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of Paricalcitol Capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e, were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than Paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers,the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3,4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC o-\u221e . approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Paricalcitol is a synthetic, biologically active vitamin D 2 analog of calcitriol. Preclinical and in vitro studies have demonstrated that paricalcitol's biological actions are mediated through binding of the VDR, which results in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways. Vitamin D and paricalcitol have been shown to reduce parathyroid hormone levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Paricalcitol decreases serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and increases serum calcium and serum phosphorous in both HD and PD patients. This observed relationship was quantified using a mathematical model for HD and PD patient populations separately. Computer-based simulations of 100 trials in HD or PD patients (N = 100) using these relationships predict slightly lower efficacy (at least two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH) with lower hypercalcemia rates (at least two consecutive serum calcium \u2265 10.5 mg/dL) for lower iPTH-based dosing regimens. Further lowering of hypercalcemia rates was predicted if the treatment with paricalcitol is initiated in patients with lower serum calcium levels at screening. Based on these simulations, a dosing regimen of iPTH/80 with a screening serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL, approximately 76.5% (95% CI: 75.6% \u2013 77.3%) of HD patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH over a duration of 12 weeks. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.7% \u2013 1.0%). In PD patients, with this dosing regimen, approximately 83.3% (95% CI: 82.6% \u2013 84.0%) of patients are predicted to achieve at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH. The predicted incidence of hypercalcemia is 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7% -13.0%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of Paricalcitol Capsules under low-fat fed condition ranged from 72% to 86% in healthy adult volunteers, CKD Stage 5 patients on HD, and CKD Stage 5 patients on PD. A food effect study in healthy adult volunteers indicated that the C max and AUC 0-\u221e, were unchanged when paricalcitol was administered with a high fat meal compared to fasting. Food delayed T max by about 2 hours. The AUC 0-\u221e of paricalcitol increased proportionally over the dose range of 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg in healthy adult volunteers. Distribution Paricalcitol is extensively bound to plasma proteins (\u2265 99.8%). The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 0.24 mcg/kg dose of paricalcitol in healthy adult volunteers was 34 L. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a 4 mcg dose of paricalcitol in CKD Stage 3 and a 3 mcg dose in CKD Stage 4 patients is between 44 and 46 L. Metabolism After oral administration of a 0.48 mcg/kg dose of 3 H-paricalcitol, parent drug was extensively metabolized, with only about 2% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the feces, and no parent drug was found in the urine. Several metabolites were detected in both the urine and feces. Most of the systemic exposure was from the parent drug. Two minor metabolites, relative to paricalcitol, were detected in human plasma. One metabolite was identified as 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol, while the other metabolite was unidentified. The 24(R)-hydroxy paricalcitol is less active than Paricalcitol in an in vivo rat model of PTH suppression. In vitro data suggest that paricalcitol is metabolized by multiple hepatic and non-hepatic enzymes, including mitochondrial CYP24, as well as CYP3A4 and UGT1A4. The identified metabolites include the product of 24(R)-hydroxylation, 24,26- and 24,28-dihydroxylation and direct glucuronidation. Elimination Paricalcitol is eliminated primarily via hepatobiliary excretion; approximately 70% of the radiolabeled dose is recovered in the feces and 18% is recovered in the urine. While the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol is 4 to 6 hours in healthy adult volunteers,the mean elimination half-life of paricalcitol in CKD Stages 3,4, and 5 (on HD and PD) patients ranged from 14 to 20 hours.

Specific Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been investigated in geriatric patients greater than 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)] . Pediatric Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Gender The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol following single doses over the 0.06 to 0.48 mcg/kg dose range was gender independent. Hepatic Impairment The disposition of paricalcitol (0.24 mcg/kg) was compared in patients with mild (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) hepatic impairment (as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) and subjects with normal hepatic function (n = 10). The pharmacokinetics of unbound paricalcitol was similar across the range of hepatic function evaluated in this study. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol has not been evaluated. Renal Impairment Following administration of paricalcitol capsules, the pharmacokinetic profile of paricalcitol for CKD Stage 5 on HD or PD was comparable to that in CKD 3 or 4 patients. Therefore, no special dose adjustments are required other than those recommended in the Dosage and Administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that paricalcitol is neither an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A nor an inducer of CYP2B6, CYP2C9 or CYP3A. Hence, paricalcitol is neither expected to inhibit nor induce the clearance of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Omeprazole The effect of omeprazole (40 mg capsule), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C19, on paricalcitol (four 4 mcg capsules) pharmacokinetics was investigated in a single dose, crossover study in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol was not affected when omeprazole was administered approximately 2 hours prior to the paricalcitol dose. Ketoconazole The effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, administered as 200 mg BID for 5 days on the pharmacokinetics of paricalcitol (4 mcg capsule) has been studied in healthy subjects. The C max of paricalcitol was minimally affected, but AUC o-\u221e . approximately doubled in the presence of ketoconazole. The mean half-life of paricalcitol was 17.0 hours in the presence of ketoconazole as compared to 9.8 hours, when paricalcitol was administered alone [see Drug Interactions (7)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety and efficacy of Paricalcitol Capsules were evaluated in three, 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter, Phase 3 Clinical studies in CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Two studies used an identical three times a week dosing design, and one study used a daily dosing design. A total of 107 patients received Paricalcitol Capsules and 113 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 63 years, 68% were male, 71% were Caucasian, and 26% were African-American. The average baseline iPTH was 274 pg/mL (range: 145-856 pg/mL). The average duration of CKD prior to study entry was 5.7 years. At study entry 22% were receiving calcium based phosphate binders and/or calcium supplements. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not measured. The initial dose of Paricalcitol Capsules was based on baseline iPTH. If iPTH was \u2264 500 pg/mL, Paricalcitol Capsules were administered 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. If iPTH was > 500 pg/mL, Paricalcitol Capsules were administered 2 mcg daily or 4 mcg three times a week, not more than every other day. The dose was increased by 1 mcg daily or 2 mcg three times a week every 2 to 4 weeks until iPTH levels were reduced by at least 30% from baseline. The overall average weekly dose of Paricalcitol Capsules was 9.6 mcg/week in the daily regimen and 9.5 mcg/week in the three times a week regimen. In the clinical studies, doses were titrated for any of the following reasons: if iPTH fell to <60 pg/mL, or decreased > 60% from baseline, the dose was reduced or temporarily withheld; if iPTH decreased <30% from baseline and serum calcium was \u226410.3 mg/dL and serum phosphorus was \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, the dose was increased; and if iPTH decreased between 30 to 60% from baseline and serum calcium and phosphorus were \u2264 10.3 mg/dL and \u2264 5.5 mg/dL, respectively, the dose was maintained. Additionally, if serum calcium was between 10.4 to 11.0 mg/dL, the dose was reduced irrespective of iPTH, and the dose was withheld if serum calcium was > 11.0 mg/dL. If serum phosphorus was >5.5 mg/dL, dietary counseling was provided, and phosphate binders could have been initiated or increased. If the elevation persisted, the Paricalcitol Capsules dose was decreased. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 82% of the placebo treated patients completed the 24-week treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint of at least two consecutive \u226530% reductions from baseline iPTH was achieved by 91% of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients (p <0.001). The proportion of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients achieving two consecutive \u2265 30% reductions was similar between the daily and the three times a week regimens (daily: 30/33, 91%; three times a week: 62/68, 91%). The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5 mg/dL), and hyperphosphatemia in Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients was similar to placebo. There were no treatment related adverse events associated with hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in the Paricalcitol Capsules group. No increases in urinary calcium or phosphorous were detected in Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients compared to placebo. The pattern of change in the mean values for serum iPTH during the studies is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1. Mean Values for Serum iPTH Over Time in the Three Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3, CKD Stages 3 and 4 Studies Combined The mean changes from baseline to final treatment visit in serum iPTH, calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase are shown in Table 7.

The study used a three times a week dosing design. A total of 61 patients received Paricalcitol Capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The mean age of the patients was 57 years, 67% were male, 50% were Caucasian, 45% were African-American, and 53% were diabetic. The average baseline iPTH was 701 pg/mL (range: 216-1933 pg/mL). The average time since first dialysis across all subjects was 3.3 years. The initial dose of Paricalcitol Capsules was based on baseline iPTH/60. Subsequent dose adjustments were based on iPTH/60 as well as primary chemistry results that were measured once a week. Starting at Treatment Week 2, study drug was maintained, increased or decreased weekly based on the results of the previous week\u2019s calculation of iPTH/60. Paricalcitol Capsules were administered three times a week, not more than every other day. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was 88% of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 13% of the placebo treated patients. The proportion of patients achieving at least two consecutive weekly \u2265 30% reductions from baseline iPTH was similar for HD and PD patients. The incidence of hypercalcemia (defined as two consecutive serum calcium values > 10.5mg/dL) in patients treated with Paricalcitol Capsules was 6.6% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. In PD patients the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients treated with Paricalcitol Capsules was 21% as compared to 0% for patients given placebo. The patterns of change in the mean values for serum iPTH are shown in Figure 2. The rate of hypercalcemia with Paricalcitol Capsules may be reduced with a lower dosing regimen based on the iPTH/80 formula as shown by computer simulations. The hypercalcemia rate can be further predicted to decrease, if the treatment is initiated in only those with baseline serum calcium \u2264 9.5 mg/dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].
