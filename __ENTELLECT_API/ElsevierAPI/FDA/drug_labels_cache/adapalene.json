      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. (5.1) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. (5.2) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals Private Limited, at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1 : Table 1. Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 0.1% / 2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2 , were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2. Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12 week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed adverse events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m2/day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to 6.0 mg adapalene/kg/day [25 to 59 times (mg/m2) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ=0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m2/day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m2/day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for the rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test).Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m2/day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring.

An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019.

Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. 5.3 Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22651%) are skin irritation, eczema, atopic dermatitis and skin burning sensation. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 12 weeks of treatment in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and for which the rate with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel exceeded the rate for the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u226525 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 to 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27 to 40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27 to 40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u2019 at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \u201calmost clear\u201d corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \u201cmoderate\u201d (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \u201csevere\u201d (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51 to 226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20 to 99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30 to 149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. (5.1) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. (5.2) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gabar Health Sciences Corp, at 1-470-737-9424 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1 : Table 1. Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 0.1% / 2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2 , were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2. Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12 week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed adverse events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m2/day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to 6.0 mg adapalene/kg/day [25 to 59 times (mg/m2) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in pediatric patients under the age of 9 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ=0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, photocarcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m2/day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m2/day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for the rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test).Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m2/day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12 week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% to the gel vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated \u2018Clear\u2019 and \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 at Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity : Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. ( 5.1 ) Photosensitivity : Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear broad spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.2 ) Skin Irritation : Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.2 Photosensitivity Avoid exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of broad spectrum sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. 5.3 Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or limes)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data ) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations ). Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 to 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel."

However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 to 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3, and 9 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27 to 40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \"clear\" or \"almost clear\" at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \"Clear\" corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \"almost clear\" corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \"moderate\" (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \"severe\" (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51 to 226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20 to 99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30 to 149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Adapalene acts on retinoid receptors. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes all of which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris. Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of action of adapalene is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene normalizes the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption of adapalene from adapalene cream through human skin is low. In a pharmacokinetic study with six acne patients treated once daily for 5 days with 2 grams of adapalene cream applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, there were no quantifiable amounts (limit of quantification = 0.35 ng/mL) of adapalene in the plasma samples from any patient. Excretion appears to be primarily by the biliary route."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Two vehicle-controlled clinical studies were conducted in patients 12 to 30 years of age with mild to moderate acne vulgaris, in which adapalene cream was compared with its vehicle. Patients were instructed to apply their treatment medication once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. In one study patients were provided with a soapless cleanser and were encouraged to refrain from using moisturizers. No other topical medications, other than adapalene cream, were to be applied to the face during the studies. Adapalene cream was significantly more effective than its vehicle in the reduction of acne lesion counts. The mean percent reduction in lesion counts from baseline after treatment for 12 weeks are presented in the following table: MEAN PERCENT REDUCTION IN LESION COUNTS FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12 Study No. 1 Study No. 2 Efficacy Variable Adapalene Cream, 0.1% N=119 Cream Vehicle N=118 Adapalene Cream, 0.1% N=175 Cream Vehicle N=175 Non-inflammatory lesions 34% 18% 35% 15% Inflammatory lesions 32% 17% 14% 6% Total lesions 34% 18% 30% 15% The trend in the Investigator's global assessment of severity supported the efficacy of adapalene cream when compared to the cream vehicle."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms of treatment such as erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, or pruritus may be experienced with use of adapalene cream. These are most likely to occur during the first two to four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to reduce the frequency of application or discontinue use. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. Information for Patients: Patients using adapalene cream should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used only as directed by the physician. 2. It is for external use only. 3. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. 4. Cleanse area with a mild or soapless cleanser before applying this medication. 5. Moisturizers may be used if necessary, however, products containing alpha hydroxy or glycolic acids should be avoided. 6. Exposure of the eye to this medication may result in reactions such as swelling, conjunctivitis, and eye irritation. 7. This medication should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. 8. Wax epilation should not be performed on treated skin due to the potential for skin erosions. 9. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of acne may occur. This is due to the action of this medication on previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Overall clinical benefit may be noticed after two weeks of therapy, but at least eight weeks are required to obtain consistent beneficial effects. Drug Interactions: As adapalene cream has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime rind) should be approached with caution. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with adapalene cream. If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with adapalene cream until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day, and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day. These doses are up to 8 times (mice) and 6 times (rats) in terms of mg/m 2 /day the maximum potential exposure at the recommended topical human dose (MRHD), assumed to be 2.5 grams adapalene cream, which is approximately 1.5 mg/m 2 adapalene. In the oral study, increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medullas of male rats was observed. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted. Animal studies have shown an increased risk of skin neoplasms with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or to sunlight. Although the significance of these studies to human use is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial UV irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vivo (mouse micronucleous test) and in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) studies. Reproductive function and fertility studies were conducted in rats administered oral doses of adapalene in amounts up to 20 mg/kg/day (up to 80 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). No effects of adapalene were found on the reproductive performance or fertility of the F o males or females. There were also no detectable effects on the growth, development and subsequent reproductive function of the F 1 generation. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. No teratogenic effects were seen in rats at oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day adapalene (up to 20 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). However, adapalene administered orally at doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg, (100 times the MRHD for rats or 200 times MRHD for rabbits) has been shown to be teratogenic. Cutaneous teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD for rats or 48 times the MRHD for rabbits) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene cream is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of adapalene cream were conducted in patients 12 to 30 years of age with acne vulgaris and therefore did not include subjects 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity : Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. ( 5.1 ) Photosensitivity : Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear broad spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.2 ) Skin Irritation : Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.2 Photosensitivity Avoid exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of broad spectrum sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. 5.3 Skin Irritation and Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22651%) are skin irritation, eczema, atopic dermatitis and skin burning sensation. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 12 weeks of treatment in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and for which the rate with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel exceeded the rate for the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: sunburn, blister (including vesicles and bullae), pruritus, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Sumary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range1.6 - 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0 - 24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0 - 24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27 to 40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \"clear\" or \"almost clear' at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of 'Clear' corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \"almost clear\" corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \"moderate\" (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \"severe\" (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51-226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20-99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30-149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.1 ) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1: Table 1 Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2 Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12-week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% to the gel vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated \u2018Clear\u2019 and \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 at Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% is a white to very pale yellow, opaque gel for topical use containing adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%. Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid-like properties. The chemical name for adapalene is (6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2- naphthoic acid). It has the following structural formula: Adapalene: Benzoyl Peroxide is a highly lipophilic oxidizing agent that localizes in both bacterial and keratinocyte cell membranes. The chemical name for benzoyl peroxide is dibenzoyl peroxide. It has the following structural formula: Benzoyl Peroxide: Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% contains the following inactive ingredients: acrylamide/sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymer, docusate sodium, edetate disodium, glycerin, isohexadecane, poloxamer 124, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, purified water, and sorbitan oleate."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromcytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27-40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 years study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. ( 5.1 ) Photosensitivity: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear broad spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.2 ) Skin Irritation: Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.2 Photosensitivity Avoid exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of broad spectrum sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. 5.3 Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or limes)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data). Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 years to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4 week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 grams/day to 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest and upper back. After a 4 week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine.

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4 mg/kg/day, 1.3 mg/kg/day and 4 mg/kg/day (1.2 mg/m 2 /day, 3.9 mg/m 2 /day, 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 0.5 mg/kg/day and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9 mg/m 2 /day, 3 mg/m 2 /day and 9 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15% to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 times to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27 times to 40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \"clear\" or \"almost clear\" at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of 'Clear' corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \"almost clear\" corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \"moderate\" (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \"severe\" (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51 to 226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20 to 99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30 to 149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 years to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3 Clinical Efficacy of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel at Week 12 in Subjects with Acne Vulgaris Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.3%/2.5% (N=217) Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% (N=217) * Vehicle (N=69) IGA: two-grade improvement and \"clear\" or \"almost clear\" 33.7% 27.3% 11% Inflammatory lesions: mean absolute (percent) reduction 27.8 (68.7%) 26.5 (69.3%) 13.2 (39.2%) Non-inflammatory lesions: mean absolute (percent) reduction 40.5 (68.3%) 40 (68%) 19.7 (37.4%) * This trial was not designed or powered to compare the efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel to the lower strength adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, nor to compare the lower strength adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% to the vehicle control. In subjects graded as \"severe\" (IGA Grade 4), efficacy was observed in the adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel group."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergy/hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritis. Discontinue adapalene gel in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Local Cutaneous Reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness. and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using Adapalene gel, 0.3% and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/ anaphylactic reactions during treatment. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene gel, 0.3%. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene gel, 0.3%. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/ burning were reported with use of adapalene gel, 0.3%. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of adapalene gel, 0.3% or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As adapalene gel, 0.3% has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported (\u22651%) adverse reactions were erythema,scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals Private Limited at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the multi-center, controlled clinical trial, signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation were monitored in 258 acne subjects who used Adapalene gel, 0.3% once daily for 12 weeks. Of the subjects who experienced cutaneous irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging), the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and decreased thereafter. The incidence of local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene gel, 0.3% from the controlled clinical trial is provided in the following table: Table 1: Physician assessed local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene gel Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation with Adapalene gel, 0.3% (N = 253*) Maximum Severity Scores Higher Than Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 66 (26.1%) 33 (13.0%) 1 (0.4%) Scaling 110 (43.5%) 47 (18.6%) 3 (1.2%) Dryness 113 (44.7%) 43 (17.0%) 2 (0.8%) Burning / Stinging 72 (28.5%) 36 (14.2%) 9 (3.6%) * Total number of subjects with local cutaneous data for at least one post-Baseline evaluation. Table 2: Patient reported local cutaneous adverse reactions with Adapalene Gel Adapalene Gel, 0.3% Vehicle Gel N = 258 N = 134 Related* Adverse Reactions Dry Skin Skin Discomfort 57 (22.1%) 36 (14%) 15 (5.8%) 4 (1.6%) 6 (4.5%) 2 (1.5%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) * Selected adverse reactions defined by investigator as Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1 % of subjects: acne flare, contact dermatitis, eyelid edema, conjunctivitis, erythema, pruritus, skin discoloration, rash, and eczema. In a one-year, open-label safety trial of 551 subjects with acne who received Adapalene gel, 0.3%, the pattern of adverse reactions was similar to the 12-week controlled study. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of adapalene: Immune system disorders: angioedema, face edema, lip swelling Skin disorders: application site pain Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with Adapalene Gel, use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits_ during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations ( see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene gel, 0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene gel, 0.3% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene gel, 0.3% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of adapalene gel, 0.3% to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene gel, 0.3% did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for Adapalene Gel,0.3%. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of adapalene gel was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of adapalene gel, 0.3% applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max , of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, Adapalene gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ= 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with adapalene gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks.

During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 12 weeks of treatment in at least 1% of subjects treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel and for which the rate with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel exceeded the rate for the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1.

      "6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 12 weeks of treatment in at least 1% of subjects treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel and for which the rate with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel exceeded the rate for the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u2019 at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \u201calmost clear\u201d corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \u201cmoderate\u201d (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \u201csevere\u201d (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51-226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20-99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30-149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3. Clinical Efficacy of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel at Week 12 in Subjects with Acne Vulgaris Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 0.3%/2.5% (N=217) Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% (N=217) * Vehicle Gel (N=69) IGA: two-grade improvement and \"clear\" or \"almost clear\" 33.7% 27.3% 11.0% Inflammatory lesions: mean absolute (percent) reduction 27.8 (68.7%) 26.5 (69.3%) 13.2 (39.2%) Non-inflammatory lesions: mean absolute (percent) reduction 40.5 (68.3%) 40.0 (68.0%) 19.7 (37.4%) * This trial was not designed or powered to compare the efficacy of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel to the lower strength Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, nor to compare the lower strength adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% to the vehicle control. In subjects graded as \u201csevere\u201d (IGA Grade 4), efficacy was observed in the Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide group."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data). Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6-3.1 grams/day) of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel ."

      "13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27-40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "DESCRIPTION Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1%, containing adapalene is used for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. Each mL of Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1%, contains adapalene 0.1% (1 mg) in a vehicle consisting of polyethylene glycol 400 and alcohol, denatured, 30% (w/v). The chemical name of adapalene is 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-naphthoic acid. Adapalene is a white to off-white powder which is soluble in tetrahydrofuran, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and practically insoluble in water. The molecular formula is C 28 H 28 O 3 and molecular weight is 412.52. Adapalene is represented by the following structural formula: Chemical Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Adapalene is a chemically stable, retinoid-like compound. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes all of which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris. Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of action is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene may normalize the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Pharmacokinetics Absorption of adapalene through human skin is low. Only trace amounts (< 0.25 ng/mL) of parent substance have been found in the plasma of acne patients following chronic topical application of adapalene in controlled clinical trials. Excretion appears to be primarily by the biliary route."

      "WARNINGS Use of Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1% should be discontinued if hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients is noted. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous skin, or sunburned skin. Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, or pruritus may be experienced during treatment. These are most likely to occur during the first two to four weeks and will usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of adverse events, patients should be instructed to reduce the frequency of application or discontinue use. Drug Interactions As Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1% has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohols, astringents, spices or lime) should be approached with caution. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1%. If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1% until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.3, 0.9, and 2.6 mg/kg/day and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day, approximately 4-75 times the maximal daily human topical dose. In the oral study, positive linear trends were observed in the incidence of follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in the thyroid glands of female rats, and in the incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medullas of male rats. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted. Animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or to sunlight. Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial UV irradiation sources. In a series of in vivo and in vitro studies, adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic activities. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C No teratogenic effects were seen in rats at oral doses of adapalene 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 120 times the maximal daily human topical dose. Cutaneous route teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day, up to 150 times the maximal daily human topical dose exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in rats. There are no adequate well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Adapalene Topical Solution, 0.1% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergy/hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritis. Discontinue adapalene gel in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided ( 5.2 ). Local Cutaneous Reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using adapalene gel and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions during treatment. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene gel. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of adapalene gel or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As adapalene gel has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported (\u22651%) adverse reactions were erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the multi-center, controlled clinical trial, signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation were monitored in 258 acne subjects who used adapalene gel once daily for 12 weeks. Of the subjects who experienced cutaneous irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging), the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and decreased thereafter. The incidence of local cutaneous irritation with adapalene gel from the controlled clinical trial is provided in the following table: Table 1: Physician assessed local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel * Total number of subjects with local cutaneous data for at least one post-Baseline evaluation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene gel, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of adapalene gel to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene gel did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients age 65 and above have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for adapalene gel. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of adapalene gel was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of adapalene gel applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, adapalene gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with adapalene gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Adapalene acts on retinoid receptors. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes all of which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris. Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of action of adapalene is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene normalizes the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption of adapalene from adapalene cream through human skin is low. In a pharmacokinetic study with six acne patients treated once daily for 5 days with 2 grams of adapalene cream applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, there were no quantifiable amounts (limit of quantification = 0.35 ng/mL) of adapalene in the plasma samples from any patient. Excretion appears to be primarily by the biliary route."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms of treatment such as erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, or pruritus may be experienced with use of adapalene cream. These are most likely to occur during the first two to four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to reduce the frequency of application or discontinue use. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. Information for Patients: Patients using adapalene cream should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used only as directed by the physician. 2. It is for external use only. 3. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. 4. Cleanse area with a mild or soapless cleanser before applying this medication. 5. Moisturizers may be used if necessary, however, products containing alpha hydroxyl or glycolic acids should be avoided. 6. Exposure of the eye to this medication may result in reactions such as swelling, conjunctivitis, and eye irritation. 7. This medication should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. 8. Wax epilation should not be performed on treated skin due to the potential for skin erosions. 9. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of acne may occur. This is due to the action of this medication on previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Overall clinical benefit may be noticed after two weeks of therapy, but at least eight weeks are required to obtain consistent beneficial effects. Drug Interactions: As adapalene cream has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime rind) should be approached with caution. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with adapalene cream. If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with adapalene cream until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day, and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day. These doses are up to 8 times (mice) and 6 times (rats) in terms of mg/m 2 /day the maximum potential exposure at the recommended topical human dose (MRHD), assumed to be 2.5 grams adapalene cream, which is approximately 1.5 mg/m 2 adapalene. In the oral study, increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medullas of male rats was observed. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted. Animal studies have shown an increased risk of skin neoplasms with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or to sunlight. Although the significance of these studies to human use is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial UV irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vivo (mouse micronucleous test) and in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) studies. Reproductive function and fertility studies were conducted in rats administered oral doses of adapalene in amounts up to 20 mg/kg/day (up to 80 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). No effects of adapalene were found on the reproductive performance or fertility of the Fo males or females. There were also no detectable effects on the growth, development and subsequent reproductive function of the F 1 generation. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. No teratogenic effects were seen in rats at oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day adapalene (up to 20 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). However, adapalene administered orally at doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg, (100 times the MRHD for rats or 200 times MRHD for rabbits) has been shown to be teratogenic. Cutaneous teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD for rats or 48 times the MRHD for rabbits) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene cream is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of adapalene cream were conducted in patients 12 to 30 years of age with acne vulgaris and therefore did not include subjects 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms of treatment such as erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, or pruritus may be experienced with use of adapalene cream. These are most likely to occur during the first two to four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to reduce the frequency of application or discontinue use. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. (5.1) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. (5.2) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Encube Ethicals Private Limited, at 1-833-285-4151 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1 : Table 1. Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 0.1% / 2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2 , were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2. Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12 week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed adverse events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m2/day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to 6.0 mg adapalene/kg/day [25 to 59 times (mg/m2) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ=0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m2/day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m2/day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for the rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test).Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m2/day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring.

An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1% / 2.5% or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019.

( 5.2 ) Skin Irritation : Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.2 Photosensitivity Avoid exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of broad spectrum sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. 5.3 Skin Irritation and Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or limes)."

During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 12 weeks of treatment in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and for which the rate with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel exceeded the rate for the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Sumary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range1.6 - 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0 - 24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0 - 24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27 to 40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel based on a mg/m 2 comparison.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \"clear\" or \"almost clear' at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of 'Clear' corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \"almost clear\" corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \"moderate\" (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \"severe\" (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51-226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20-99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30-149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Adapalene acts on retinoid receptors. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes all of which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris. Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of action of adapalene is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene normalizes the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Pharmacokinetics: Absorption of adapalene from adapalene cream through human skin is low. In a pharmacokinetic study with six acne patients treated once daily for 5 days with 2 grams of adapalene cream applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, there were no quantifiable amounts (limit of quantification = 0.35 ng/mL) of adapalene in the plasma samples from any patient. Excretion appears to be primarily by the biliary route."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Two vehicle-controlled clinical studies were conducted in patients 12 to 30 years of age with mild to moderate acne vulgaris, in which adapalene cream was compared with its vehicle. Patients were instructed to apply their treatment medication once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. In one study patients were provided with a soapless cleanser and were encouraged to refrain from using moisturizers. No other topical medications, other than adapalene cream, were to be applied to the face during the studies. Adapalene cream was significantly more effective than its vehicle in the reduction of acne lesion counts. The mean percent reduction in lesion counts from baseline after treatment for 12 weeks are presented in the following table: MEAN PERCENT REDUCTION IN LESION COUNTS FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12 Study No. 1 Study No. 2 Efficacy Variable Adapalene Cream, 0.1% N=119 Cream Vehicle N=118 Adapalene Cream, 0.1% N=175 Cream Vehicle N=175 Non-inflammatory lesions 34% 18% 35% 15% Inflammatory lesions 32% 17% 14% 6% Total lesions 34% 18% 30% 15% The trend in the Investigator's global assessment of severity supported the efficacy of adapalene cream when compared to the cream vehicle."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms of treatment such as erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, or pruritus may be experienced with use of adapalene cream. These are most likely to occur during the first two to four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to reduce the frequency of application or discontinue use. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. Information for Patients: Patients using adapalene cream should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used only as directed by the physician. 2. It is for external use only. 3. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. 4. Cleanse area with a mild or soapless cleanser before applying this medication. 5. Moisturizers may be used if necessary, however, products containing alpha hydroxyl or glycolic acids should be avoided. 6. Exposure of the eye to this medication may result in reactions such as swelling, conjunctivitis, and eye irritation. 7. This medication should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. 8. Wax epilation should not be performed on treated skin due to the potential for skin erosions. 9. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of acne may occur. This is due to the action of this medication on previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Overall clinical benefit may be noticed after two weeks of therapy, but at least eight weeks are required to obtain consistent beneficial effects. Drug Interactions: As adapalene cream has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime rind) should be approached with caution. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with adapalene cream. If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with adapalene cream until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day, and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day. These doses are up to 8 times (mice) and 6 times (rats) in terms of mg/m 2 /day the maximum potential exposure at the recommended topical human dose (MRHD), assumed to be 2.5 grams adapalene cream, which is approximately 1.5 mg/m 2 adapalene. In the oral study, increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medullas of male rats was observed. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted. Animal studies have shown an increased risk of skin neoplasms with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or to sunlight. Although the significance of these studies to human use is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial UV irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vivo (mouse micronucleous test) and in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) studies. Reproductive function and fertility studies were conducted in rats administered oral doses of adapalene in amounts up to 20 mg/kg/day (up to 80 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). No effects of adapalene were found on the reproductive performance or fertility of the Fo males or females. There were also no detectable effects on the growth, development and subsequent reproductive function of the F 1 generation. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. No teratogenic effects were seen in rats at oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day adapalene (up to 20 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). However, adapalene administered orally at doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg, (100 times the MRHD for rats or 200 times MRHD for rabbits) has been shown to be teratogenic. Cutaneous teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD for rats or 48 times the MRHD for rabbits) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene cream is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of adapalene cream were conducted in patients 12 to 30 years of age with acne vulgaris and therefore did not include subjects 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

In the oral study, increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medullas of male rats was observed. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted. Animal studies have shown an increased risk of skin neoplasms with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or to sunlight. Although the significance of these studies to human use is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial UV irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vivo (mouse micronucleous test) and in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) studies. Reproductive function and fertility studies were conducted in rats administered oral doses of adapalene in amounts up to 20 mg/kg/day (up to 80 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). No effects of adapalene were found on the reproductive performance or fertility of the Fo males or females. There were also no detectable effects on the growth, development and subsequent reproductive function of the F 1 generation."

      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects. Pregnancy Category C. No teratogenic effects were seen in rats at oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day adapalene (up to 20 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). However, adapalene administered orally at doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg, (100 times the MRHD for rats or 200 times MRHD for rabbits) has been shown to be teratogenic. Cutaneous teratology studies in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD for rats or 48 times the MRHD for rabbits) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus."

( 5.2 ) \u2022 Skin Irritation: Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.2 Photosensitivity Avoid exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, during the use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of broad spectrum sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. 5.3 Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 12 weeks of treatment in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% and for which the rate with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% exceeded the rate for the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 - 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27-40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development or reproductive function of F 1 offspring.

The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u201d at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \u201calmost clear\u201d corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \u201cmoderate\u201d (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \u201csevere\u201d (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51-226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20-99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30-149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 - 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27-40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u201d at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \u201calmost clear\u201d corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \u201cmoderate\u201d (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \u201csevere\u201d (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51-226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20-99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30-149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Adapalene acts on retinoid receptors. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes all of which represent important features in the pathology of acne vulgaris. Mechanistically, adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to the cytosolic receptor protein. Although the exact mode of action of adapalene is unknown, it is suggested that topical adapalene normalizes the differentiation of follicular epithelial cells resulting in decreased microcomedone formation. Pharmacokinetics Absorption of adapalene from Adapalene Cream, 0.1% through human skin is low. In a pharmacokinetic study with six acne patients treated once daily for 5 days with 2 grams of Adapalene Cream, 0.1% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, there were no quantifiable amounts (limit of quantification = 0.35 ng/mL) of adapalene in the plasma samples from any patient. Excretion appears to be primarily by the biliary route."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Certain cutaneous signs and symptoms of treatment such as erythema, dryness, scaling, burning, or pruritus may be experienced with use of Adapalene Cream, 0.1%. These are most likely to occur during the first two to four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to reduce the frequency of application or discontinue use. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. Information for Patients Patients using Adapalene Cream, 0.1% should receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used only as directed by the physician. 2. It is for external use only. 3. Avoid contact with the eyes, lips, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. 4. Cleanse area with a mild or soapless cleanser before applying this medication. 5. Moisturizers may be used if necessary; however, products containing alpha hydroxy or glycolic acids should be avoided. 6. Exposure of the eye to this medication may result in reactions such as swelling, conjunctivitis, and eye irritation. 7. This medication should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. 8. Wax epilation should not be performed on treated skin due to the potential for skin erosions. 9. During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of acne may occur. This is due to the action of this medication on previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy. Overall clinical benefit may be noticed after two weeks of therapy, but at least eight weeks are required to obtain consistent beneficial effects. Drug Interactions As Adapalene Cream, 0.1% has the potential to produce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime rind) should be approached with caution. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid in combination with Adapalene Cream, 0.1%. If these preparations have been used, it is advisable not to start therapy with Adapalene Cream, 0.1% until the effects of such preparations in the skin have subsided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day, and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day. These doses are up to 8 times (mice) and 6 times (rats) in terms of mg/m 2 /day the maximum potential exposure at the recommended topical human dose (MRHD), assumed to be 2.5 grams Adapalene Cream, 0.1%, which is approximately 1.5 mg/m 2 adapalene. In the oral study, increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medullas of male rats was observed. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted. Animal studies have shown an increased risk of skin neoplasms with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or to sunlight. Although the significance of these studies to human use is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial UV irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vivo (mouse micronucleus test) and in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) studies. Reproductive function and fertility studies were conducted in rats administered oral doses of adapalene in amounts up to 20 mg/kg/day (up to 80 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). No effects of adapalene were found on the reproductive performance or fertility of the F 0 males or females. There were also no detectable effects on the growth, development and subsequent reproductive function of the F 1 generation. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy category C No teratogenic effects were seen in rats at oral doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day adapalene (up to 20 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 comparisons). However, adapalene administered orally at doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg, (100 times the MRHD for rats or 200 times MRHD for rabbits) has been shown to be teratogenic. Cutaneous teratology studies in rats and rabbits as doses of 0.6, 2.0, and 6.0 mg/kg/day (24 times MRHD for rats or 48 times the MRHD for rabbits) exhibited on fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Adapalene Cream, 0.1% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Adapalene Cream, 0.1% were conducted in patients 12 to 30 years of age with acne vulgaris and therefore did not include subjects 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic/Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergy/hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritis. Discontinue Adapalene Gel in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. (5.1) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided (5.2). Local Cutaneous Reactions : Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of Adapalene Gel. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. (5.3). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using Adapalene Gel and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions during treatment.. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of Adapalene Gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene Gel. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of Adapalene Gel. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of Adapalene Gel or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As Adapalene Gel has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

In the multi-center, controlled clinical trial, signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation were monitored in 258 acne subjects who used Adapalene Gel once daily for 12 weeks. Of the subjects who experienced cutaneous irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging), the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and decreased thereafter. The incidence of local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel from the controlled clinical trial is provided in the following table: Table 1: Physician assessed local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel * Total number of subjects with local cutaneous data for at least one post-Baseline evaluation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with Adapalene Gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene Gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene Gel, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene Gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of Adapalene Gel to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Adapalene Gel did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients age 65 and above have not been established."

      "8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene Gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene Gel, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene Gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of Adapalene Gel to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for Adapalene Gel. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of Adapalene Gel was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of Adapalene Gel applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AU CO-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, Adapalene Gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1 % was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOQ = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1 % who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergy/hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritis. Discontinue adapalene gel in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided ( 5.2 ). Local Cutaneous Reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using adapalene gel and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions during treatment. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene gel. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of adapalene gel or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As adapalene gel has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported (\u22651%) adverse reactions were erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the multi-center, controlled clinical trial, signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation were monitored in 258 acne subjects who used adapalene gel once daily for 12 weeks. Of the subjects who experienced cutaneous irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging), the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and decreased thereafter. The incidence of local cutaneous irritation with adapalene gel from the controlled clinical trial is provided in the following table: Table 1: Physician assessed local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel * Total number of subjects with local cutaneous data for at least one post-Baseline evaluation. Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation with Adapalene Gel (N = 253*) Maximum Severity Scores Higher Than Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 66 (26.1%) 33 (13.0%) 1 (0.4%) Scaling 110 (43.5%) 47 (18.6%) 3 (1.2%) Dryness 113 (44.7%) 43 (17.0%) 2 (0.8%) Burning/Stinging 72 (28.5%) 36 (14.2%) 9 (3.6%) Table 2: Patient reported local cutaneous adverse reactions with Adapalene Gel *Selected adverse reactions defined by investigator as Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related Adapalene Gel Vehicle Gel N=258 N=134 Related* Adverse Reactions 57 (22.1%) 6 (4.5%) Dry Skin 36 (14%) 2 (1.5%) Skin Discomfort 15 (5.8%) 0 (0.0%) Desquamation 4 (1.6%) 0 (0.0%) The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of subjects: acne flare, contact dermatitis, eyelid edema, conjunctivitis, erythema, pruritus, skin discoloration, rash, and eczema. In a one-year, open-label safety trial of 551 subjects with acne who received adapalene gel, the pattern of adverse reactions was similar to the 12-week controlled study. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of adapalene: Immune system disorders: angioedema, face edema, lip swelling Skin disorders: application site pain Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene gel, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of adapalene gel to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene gel did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients age 65 and above have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for adapalene gel. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of adapalene gel was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of adapalene gel applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, adapalene gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with adapalene gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of fertility studies were conducted with adapalene gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.1 ) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1%/2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1%/2.5% were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. at 1-866-923-4914 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1%/2.5%. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1: Table 1: Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/ Preferred Term Adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel N = 564 Vehicle gel N = 489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2: Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N = 553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12-week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel 0.1%/2.5%. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m 2 /day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2219h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3, and 9 mg/m 2 /day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromcytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 years study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel to the gel vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated 'Clear' and 'Almost Clear' at Week 12 based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of 'Clear' corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of 'Almost Clear' corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 'Moderate' which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of 'Moderate'. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of 'Moderate'. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. (5.1) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel pad and may necessitate discontinuation. (5.2) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel pad. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel pad. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel pad. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel pad, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel pad. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (greater than or equal to 1%) in patients treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gabar at 1-470-737-9424 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1: Table 1. Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/ Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide N=564 Vehicle N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2. Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12 week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide or with the vehicle once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination or benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m 2 /day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of greater than or equal to 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to 6 mg adapalene/kg/day [25 to 59 times (mg/m 2 ) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene and benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in pediatric patients under the age of 9 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ=0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, photocarcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12 week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide to the vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated \u2018Clear\u2019 and \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 at Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline, subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide or vehicle. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergy/hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritis. Discontinue adapalene gel in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided ( 5.2 ). Local Cutaneous Reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. (5.3). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using adapalene gel and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions during treatment. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene gel. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene gel. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of adapalene gel or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As adapalene gel has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported (\u2265 1%) adverse reactions were erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the multi-center, controlled clinical trial, signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation were monitored in 258 acne subjects who used adapalene gel once daily for 12 weeks. Of the subjects who experienced cutaneous irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging), the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and decreased thereafter. The incidence of local cutaneous irritation with adapalene gel from the controlled clinical trial is provided in the following table: Table 1: Physician assessed local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation with Adapalene Gel (N =253*) Maximum Severity Scores Higher Than Mild Moderate Severe * Total number of subjects with local cutaneous data for at least one post-Baseline evaluation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m\u00b2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m\u00b2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene gel, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene gel on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of adapalene gel to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene gel did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients age 65 and above have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for adapalene gel. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of adapalene gel was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of adapalene gel applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, adapalene gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with adapalene gel who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with adapalene gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of fertility studies were conducted with adapalene gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4 mg/kg/day, 1.3 mg/kg/day, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 0.5 mg/kg/day, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F1 offspring."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. (5.1) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. (5.2) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1: Table 1 Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2 Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12-week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1: Table 1 Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2 Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12-week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time.",
      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% to the gel vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated \u2018Clear\u2019 and \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 at Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.

Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid-like properties. The chemical name for adapalene is (6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2- naphthoic acid). It has the following structural formula: Adapalene: Benzoyl Peroxide is a highly lipophilic oxidizing agent that localizes in both bacterial and keratinocyte cell membranes. The chemical name for benzoyl peroxide is dibenzoyl peroxide. It has the following structural formula: Benzoyl Peroxide: Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% contains the following inactive ingredients: acrylamide/sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymer, docusate sodium, edetate disodium, glycerin, isohexadecane, poloxamer 124, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, purified water, and sorbitan oleate. chemical structure adapalene.jpg chemical structure benzoyl peroxide.jpg"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, photocarcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromcytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27-40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 years study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

Discontinue adapalene gel in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Local Cutaneous Reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness. and stinging/burning were reported with use of adapalene gel. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using Adapalene gel, 0.3% and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/ anaphylactic reactions during treatment. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of adapalene gel, 0.3%. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene gel, 0.3%. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/ burning were reported with use of adapalene gel, 0.3%. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of adapalene gel, 0.3% or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As adapalene gel, 0.3% has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with Adapalene Gel, use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits_ during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations ( see Data ). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u226525 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for adapalene gel, 0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from adapalene gel, 0.3% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use adapalene gel, 0.3% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of adapalene gel, 0.3% to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene gel, 0.3% did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for Adapalene Gel,0.3%. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of adapalene gel was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of adapalene gel, 0.3% applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max , of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng.h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, Adapalene gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ= 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with adapalene gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks.

Discontinue Adapalene Gel, 0.3% in the event of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided ( 5.2 ). Local Cutaneous Reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of Adapalene Gel, 0.3%. Concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution. ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Allergic/ Hypersensitivity Reactions Adverse reactions including anaphylaxis angioedema, face edema, eyelid edema, lip swelling, and pruritus that sometimes required medical treatment have been reported during postmarketing use of adapalene. Advise a patient to stop using Adapalene Gel, 0.3% and seek medical attention if experiencing allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions during treatment. 5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during use of Adapalene Gel, 0.3%. Patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure, and those with inherent sensitivity to sun, should be warned to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene Gel, 0.3%. 5.3 Local Cutaneous Reactions Cutaneous signs and symptoms such as erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning were reported with use of Adapalene Gel, 0.3%. These were most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, were mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessened with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these side effects, patients should be instructed to either use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% or discontinue use. Avoid application to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene. As adapalene gel has the potential to induce local irritation in some patients, concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or lime) should be approached with caution."

In the multi-center, controlled clinical trial, signs and symptoms of local cutaneous irritation were monitored in 258 acne subjects who used Adapalene Gel, 0.3% once daily for 12 weeks. Of the subjects who experienced cutaneous irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, and/or burning/stinging), the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity, occurred early in treatment and decreased thereafter. The incidence of local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% from the controlled clinical trial is provided in the following table: Table 1: Physician assessed local cutaneous irritation with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% (N = 253 Total number of subjects with local cutaneous data for at least one post-Baseline evaluation. ) Maximum Severity Scores Higher Than Baseline Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 66 (26.1%) 33 (13%) 1 (0.4%) Scaling 110 (43.5%) 47 (18.6%) 3 (1.2%) Dryness 113 (44.7%) 43 (17%) 2 (0.8%) Burning/Stinging 72 (28.5%) 36 (14.2%) 9 (3.6%) Table 2: Patient reported local cutaneous adverse reactions with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% Adapalene Gel, 0.3% Vehicle Gel N=258 N=134 Related Selected adverse reactions defined by investigator as Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related Adverse Reactions 57 (22.1%) 6 (4.5%) Dry Skin 36 (14%) 2 (1.5%) Skin Discomfort 15 (5.8%) 0 (0%) Desquamation 4 (1.6%) 0 (0%) The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of subjects: acne flare, contact dermatitis, eyelid edema, conjunctivitis, erythema, pruritus, skin discoloration, rash, and eczema. In a one-year, open-label safety trial of 551 subjects with acne who received Adapalene Gel, 0.3%, the pattern of adverse reactions was similar to the 12-week controlled study. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of adapalene: Immune system disorders: angioedema, face edema, lip swelling Skin disorders: application site pain Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 40 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (40 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topical adapalene gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations ) . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene Gel, 0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene Gel, 0.3%, or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene Gel, 0.3% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Avoid application of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% to areas with increased risk for potential ingestion by or ocular exposure to the breastfeeding child. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% did not include subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization, and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical pharmacodynamic studies have not been conducted for Adapalene Gel, 0.3%. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng\u2219h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, Adapalene Gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following topical application of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% was evaluated in a clinical trial. Sixteen acne subjects were treated once daily for 10 days with 2 grams of Adapalene Gel, 0.3% applied to the face, chest and back, corresponding to approximately 2 mg/cm 2 . Fifteen subjects had quantifiable (LOQ = 0.1 ng/mL) adapalene levels resulting in a mean C max of 0.553 \u00b1 0.466 ng/mL on Day 10 of treatment. The mean AUC 0-24hr was 8.37 \u00b1 8.46 ng\u2219h/mL as determined in 15 of the 16 subjects on Day 10. The terminal apparent half-life, determined in 15 of 16 subjects, ranged from 7 to 51 hours, with a mean of 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 hours. Adapalene was rapidly cleared from plasma and was not detected 72 hours after the last application for all but one subject. Exposure of potential circulating metabolites of adapalene was not measured. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. In another clinical trial in subjects with moderate to moderately severe acne, Adapalene Gel, 0.3% or Adapalene Gel, 0.1% was applied to the face and optionally to the trunk, once daily for 12 weeks. Seventy-eight (78) subjects had plasma adapalene levels evaluated at Weeks 2, 8, and 12. Of the 209 plasma samples analyzed, adapalene concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD = 0.15 ng/mL) of the method in all samples but three. For the three samples, traces of adapalene below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.25 ng/mL) of the method were found. One of these samples was taken at Week 12 from a male subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.3% who treated the face and the trunk for eight weeks (thereafter, only the face was treated). The second and third samples were from the Week 2 and 12 visits of a female subject treated with Adapalene Gel, 0.1% who treated only the face for 12 weeks. In this study, the average daily usage of product was 1 g/day."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or impairment of fertility studies were conducted with Adapalene Gel, 0.3%. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day) and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development, or reproductive function of F 1 offspring."

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Photosensitivity: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear broad spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Skin Irritation: Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria, have been reported with the use of benzoyl peroxide products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% immediately and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.2 Photosensitivity Avoid exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, during the use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of broad spectrum sunscreen products and protective apparel (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. 5.3 Skin Irritation/Contact Dermatitis Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

During the randomized, double-blind, vehicle- and active-controlled clinical trial, 217 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. A total of 197 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel. Adapalene gel, 0.3% Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0.3% use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations (see Data) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Hence, maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0.15 to 5.0 mg/kg/day, up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% based on a mg/m 2 comparison. However, malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg/kg/day adapalene (41 and 81 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele, and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos, and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6.0 mg/kg/day (9.7 and 19.5 times the MRHD, respectively, based on a mg/m 2 comparison) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations (supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel, 0.3% There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. In animal studies, adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations) . Benzoyl peroxide gel, 2.5% The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown. Based on the published literature, benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid (an endogenous substance), which is eliminated in the urine. Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases. There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk, use Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects (12 to 33 years of age) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once-daily applications during a 4-week period with, on average, 2.3 grams/day (range 1.6 - 3.1 grams/day) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% applied as a thin layer to the face, shoulders, upper chest, and upper back. After a 4-week treatment, 16 subjects (62%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL, with a mean C max of 0.16 \u00b1 0.08 ng/mL and a mean AUC 0-24hr of 2.49 \u00b1 1.21 ng.h/mL. The most exposed subject had adapalene C max and AUC 0-24hr of 0.35 ng/mL and 6.41 ng.h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 0.3%/2.5%."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). The highest dose levels are 3.2 (mice) and 2.4 (rats) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% based on a mg/m 2 comparison. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg/kg benzoyl peroxide (27-40 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison). Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species. The significance of this finding in humans is unknown. Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, or mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links in mammalian cells, increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and was mutagenic in a few, but not all, in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames tests) conducted. In rat oral studies, 20 mg/kg/day adapalene (32 times the MRHD based on a mg/m 2 comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females or the growth, development or reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5% to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris. The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%. In this trial, 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 0.3%/2.5%, 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated \u201cclear\u201d or \u201calmost clear\u201d at Week 12 with at least a two-grade improvement based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA), and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesions. An IGA score of \u201calmost clear\u201d corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. At baseline, 50% of subjects were graded as \u201cmoderate\u201d (IGA Grade 3) and 50% were graded as \u201csevere\u201d (IGA Grade 4) on the IGA scale. Subjects had an average of 98 (range 51-226) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 (range: 20-99) and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions was 60 (range 30-149). Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years, with 273 (54%) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age. Approximately equal number of males (48%) and females (52%) were enrolled. The IGA success rate, mean reduction, and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table. Table 3.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.1 ) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \u201cwaxing\u201d as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5%. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1: Table 1 Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% N=564 Vehicle gel N=489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2 Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N=553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12-week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% to the gel vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated \u2018Clear\u2019 and \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 at Week 12 based on the Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of \u2018Clear\u2019 corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% is a white to very pale yellow, opaque gel for topical use containing adapalene 0.1% and benzoyl peroxide 2.5%. Adapalene, a synthetic retinoid, is a naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid-like properties. The chemical name for adapalene is (6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2- naphthoic acid). It has the following structural formula: Adapalene: Benzoyl Peroxide is a highly lipophilic oxidizing agent that localizes in both bacterial and keratinocyte cell membranes. The chemical name for benzoyl peroxide is dibenzoyl peroxide. It has the following structural formula: Benzoyl Peroxide: Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% contains the following inactive ingredients: acrylamide/sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymer, docusate sodium, edetate disodium, glycerin, isohexadecane, poloxamer 124, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, purified water, and sorbitan oleate. chemical structure adapalene.jpg chemical structure benzoyl peroxide.jpg"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 0.1%/2.5% is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5% in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4.0 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3.0, and 9.0 mg/m 2 /day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromcytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15-25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6-10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, 0.1%/2.5%) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27-40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 years study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen when sun exposure cannot be avoided. ( 5.1 ) Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel and may necessitate discontinuation. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Patients with high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective apparel, (e.g., hat) are recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating to patients under treatment with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. 5.2 Local Cutaneous Reactions Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. These are most likely to occur during the first four weeks of treatment, are mostly mild to moderate in intensity, and usually lessen with continued use of the medication. Irritant and allergic contact dermatitis may occur. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, patients should be instructed to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of the application of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, or discontinue use. The product should not be applied to cuts, abrasions, eczematous or sunburned skin. As with other retinoids, use of \"waxing\" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Avoid concomitant use of other potentially irritating topical products (medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have strong skin-drying effect and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices, or limes)."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most commonly reported adverse events (\u22651%) in patients treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel were dry skin, contact dermatitis, application site burning, application site irritation and skin irritation. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA at 1 (888) 721-7115, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical trials, 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris, 12 years and older, were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months. Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle gel are presented in Table 1: Table 1 Drug Related Adverse Events Reported in Clinical Trials by At Least 1% of Patients Treated For 12 Weeks System Organ Class/Preferred Term Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide gel N = 564 Vehicle gel N = 489 Subjects with AE (s) 14% 4% Dry Skin 7% 2% Contact dermatitis 3% <1% Application site burning 2% <1% Application site irritation 1% <1% Skin irritation 1% 0% Local tolerability evaluations, presented in Table 2, were conducted at each study visit in clinical trials by assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, and stinging. Table 2 Incidence of Local Cutaneous Irritation in Controlled Clinical Trials (N = 553) Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms Maximum Severity During Treatment End of Treatment Severity (12 Weeks) Mild Moderate Severe Mild Moderate Severe Erythema 27% 13% 1% 8% 2% 1% Scaling 35% 11% 1% 9% 1% <1% Dryness 41% 13% 1% 10% 2% <1% Stinging/burning 41% 15% 3% 7% 2% 1% Analysis over the 12-week period showed that local tolerability scores for erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning peaked at Week 1 of therapy and decreased thereafter. During a pediatric clinical trial, 285 children with acne vulgaris, 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel or with the vehicle gel once daily for 12 weeks. Overall, the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above, both in the nature and frequency of the observed events. Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above, with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel: eyelid edema, sunburn, blister, pain of skin, pruritus, swelling face, conjunctivitis, skin discoloration, rash, eczema, throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. There are no well-controlled trials in pregnant women treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel or benzoyl peroxide. Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m 2 /day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to 6 mg adapalene/kg/day [25 to 59 times (mg/m 2 ) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel in pediatric patients under the age of 9 have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

Furthermore, such studies are not always predictive of human response; therefore, adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0.15 to 5 mg adapalene/kg/day, up to 25 times (mg/m 2 /day) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. However, teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of \u2265 25 mg adapalene/kg/day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD, respectively. Findings included cleft palate, microphthalmia, encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats; and umbilical hernia, exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits. Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0.6 to 6 mg adapalene/kg/day [25 to 59 times (mg/m 2 ) the MRHD] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein. Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation, keratinization and inflammatory processes. However, the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown. Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel is unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams/day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel applied to 1000 cm 2 of acne involved skin, (face, chest, and upper back). Two subjects (20%) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification (LOQ = 0.1ng/mL). The highest adapalene C max and AUC 0-24h was 0.21 ng/mL and 1.99 ng\u2022h/mL, respectively. Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route. Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated. Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity, photocarcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0.4, 1.3, and 4 mg/kg/day (1.2, 3.9, and 12 mg/m 2 /day), and in rats at oral doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day (0.9, 3, and 9 mg/m 2 /day). In terms of body surface area, the highest dose levels are 9.8 (mice) and 7.4 times (rats) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel. In the rat study, an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed. No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel (6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel) for two years. Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 (males) and 205 (females) mg benzoyl peroxide/kg. In terms of body surface area, these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD. Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 years study period, and in mice topically treated with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years. The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species. However, the significance of this finding in humans is unknown. In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5% benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel, no increase in UV-induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks. No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene. However, animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs (e.g., retinoids) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight. Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear, patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources. Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro (Ames test, Chinese hamster ovary cell assay, mouse lymphoma TK assay) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Bacterial mutagenicity assays (Ames test) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results, mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations. Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single-strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells, it has caused DNA-protein cross-links in the human cells, and has also induced a dose-dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In rat oral studies, 20 mg adapalene/kg/day (120 mg/m 2 /day; 98 times the MRHD based on mg/m 2 /day comparison) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F 0 males and females, or growth, development and reproductive function of F 1 offspring. No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week, multicenter, controlled clinical studies of similar design, comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel to the gel vehicle in acne subjects. Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two grade improvement and rated \u2018Clear\u2019 and \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 at Week 12 based on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. An IGA score of 'Clear' corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present. An IGA score of \u2018Almost Clear\u2019 corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules. In Study 1, 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions. The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of \u2018Moderate\u2019 which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved, many comedones, papules and pustules. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 2, 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel, adapalene 0.1% in vehicle gel, benzoyl peroxide 2.5% in vehicle gel, or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49% were males. At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non-inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of \u2018Moderate\u2019. The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3. In Study 3, 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel or vehicle gel. The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24% were males. At baseline, subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions (inflammatory and/or non-inflammatory) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of 'Moderate'.
