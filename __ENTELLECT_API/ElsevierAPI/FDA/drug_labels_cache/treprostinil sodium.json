( 1.1 ) \u2022 Pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD; WHO Group 3) to improve exercise ability. The study establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with etiologies of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%). ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension YUTREPIA is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with NYHA Functional Class III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (56%) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (33%). The effects diminish over the minimum recommended dosing interval of 4 hours; treatment timing can be adjusted for planned activities. While there are long-term data on use of treprostinil by other routes of administration, nearly all controlled clinical experience with inhaled treprostinil has been on a background of bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) or sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor). The controlled clinical experience was limited to 12 weeks in duration [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 1.2 Pulmonary Hypertension Associated with ILD YUTREPIA is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD; WHO Group 3) to improve exercise ability. The study establishing effectiveness predominately included patients with etiologies of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Treprostinil may cause symptomatic hypotension. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Dosage adjustments may be necessary if inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are added or withdrawn. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 May cause bronchospasm: Patients with a history of hyperreactive airway disease may be more sensitive. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Risk of Symptomatic Hypotension Treprostinil is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, treatment with treprostinil may produce symptomatic hypotension. 5.2 Risk of Bleeding Treprostinil inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding. 5.3 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil Co-administration of a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor (e.g., gemfibrozil) may increase exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of a CYP2C8 enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampin) may decrease exposure to treprostinil. Increased exposure is likely to increase adverse events associated with treprostinil administration, whereas decreased exposure is likely to reduce clinical effectiveness [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.4 Bronchospasm Like other inhaled prostaglandins, YUTREPIA may cause acute bronchospasm. Patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other bronchial hyperreactivity, are at increased risk for bronchospasm. Ensure that such patients are treated optimally for reactive airway disease prior to and during treatment with YUTREPIA."

The safety and tolerability of YUTREPIA was evaluated in an open label study (INSPIRE) of 121 patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 and NYHA Functional Class II [80 patients] and Class III [41 patients]) followed for up to 2 months. The most commonly reported adverse reactions included cough, headache, throat irritation, dizziness, which are known side effects of treprostinil inhalation solution. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 4% of the overall INSPIRE safety population. The adverse reactions in the INSPIRE study were consistent with those observed in previous studies of inhaled treprostinil.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers In vitro studies of human hepatic microsomes showed that treprostinil does not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. Additionally, treprostinil does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil increases exposure (both C max and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer rifampin decreases exposure to treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on Treprostinil Drug interaction studies have been carried out with treprostinil (oral or subcutaneous) co-administered with acetaminophen (4 g/day), warfarin (25 mg/day), and fluconazole (200 mg/day), respectively, in healthy volunteers. These studies did not show a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil. Treprostinil does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. The pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin and the INR in healthy subjects given a single 25 mg dose of warfarin were unaffected by continuous subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil at an infusion rate of 10 ng/kg/min."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited case reports of treprostinil use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, there are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (see Clinical Considerations ). In animal studies, no adverse reproductive and developmental effects were seen for treprostinil at 3 9 and 3 145 times the human exposure when based on C max and AUC, respectively, following a single YUTREPIA dose of 79.5 mcg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and embryo-fetal risk Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal mortality. Data Animal reproduction studies have been conducted with treprostinil via continuous subcutaneous administration and with treprostinil diolamine administered orally. In studies with orally administered treprostinil diolamine, no adverse effect doses for fetal viability/growth, fetal development (teratogenicity), and postnatal development were determined in rats. In pregnant rats, no evidence of harm to the fetus was observed following oral administration of treprostinil diolamine at the highest dose tested (20 mg/kg/day), which represents about 154 and 1479 times the human exposure, when based on C max and AUC, respectively, following a single YUTREPIA dose of 79.5 mcg. In pregnant rabbits, external fetal and soft tissue malformations and fetal skeletal malformation occurred. The dose at which no adverse effects were seen (0.5 mg/kg/day) represents about 9 and 145 times the human exposure, when based on C max and AUC, respectively, following a single YUTREPIA dose of 79.5 mcg. No treprostinil treatment-related effects on labor and delivery were seen in animal studies. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of treprostinil in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Placebo-controlled clinical studies of treprostinil inhalation solution did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. The open-label INSPIRE study in PAH patients included 28 patients aged 65 and over in which no age-related differences were noted. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of hepatic, renal, or cardiac dysfunction, and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy. 8.6 Patients with Hepatic Insufficiency Plasma clearance of treprostinil, delivered subcutaneously, was reduced up to 80% in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. Uptitrate slowly when treating patients with hepatic insufficiency because of the risk of an increase in systemic exposure which may lead to an increase in dose-dependent adverse effects. Treprostinil has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Patients with Renal Insufficiency No dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. Treprostinil is not cleared by dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The major pharmacologic actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. Other studies have shown that treprostinil causes a dose-related negative inotropic and lusitropic effect. No major effects on cardiac conduction have been observed. Treprostinil produces vasodilation and tachycardia. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a clinical trial of 240 healthy volunteers, single doses of treprostinil inhalation solution 54 mcg (the target maintenance dose per session) and 84 mcg (supratherapeutic inhalation dose) prolonged the corrected QTc interval by approximately 10 ms. The QTc effect dissipated rapidly as the concentration of treprostinil decreased. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In healthy volunteer studies, the systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) post-inhalation was shown to be proportional to the YUTREPIA doses administered (25 mcg \u2013 150 mcg). The treprostinil mean C max , mean AUC inf and median T max following a single inhaled target maintenance dose of 79.5 mcg YUTREPIA were 1.48 ng/mL, 1.04 hr.ng/mL and 0.13 hr, respectively. Distribution In vitro treprostinil is 91% bound to human plasma proteins over the 330-10,000 ng/mL concentration range. Metabolism and Excretion Of subcutaneously administered treprostinil, only 4% is excreted unchanged in urine. Treprostinil is substantially metabolized by the liver, primarily by CYP2C8. Metabolites are excreted in urine (79%) and feces (13%) over 10 days. Five apparently inactive metabolites were detected in the urine, each accounting for 10\u201115% of the dose administered. Four of the metabolites are products of oxidation of the 3-hydroxyloctyl side chain and one is a glucuroconjugated derivative (treprostinil glucuronide). Elimination Following inhaled administration of YUTREPIA, disposition and elimination is monophasic with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes. Specific Populations Hepatic Insufficiency Plasma clearance of treprostinil, delivered subcutaneously, was reduced up to 80% in subjects presenting with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. Treprostinil has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Renal Insufficiency In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis (n=8), administration of a single 1 mg dose of orally administered treprostinil pre-and post-dialysis resulted in AUC0-inf that was not significantly altered compared to healthy subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] ."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In animals, the vasodilatory effects reduce right and left ventricular afterload and increase cardiac output and stroke volume. Other studies have shown that treprostinil causes a dose-related negative inotropic and lusitropic effect. No major effects on cardiac conduction have been observed. Treprostinil produces vasodilation and tachycardia. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a clinical trial of 240 healthy volunteers, single doses of treprostinil inhalation solution 54 mcg (the target maintenance dose per session) and 84 mcg (supratherapeutic inhalation dose) prolonged the corrected QTc interval by approximately 10 ms. The QTc effect dissipated rapidly as the concentration of treprostinil decreased."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In healthy volunteer studies, the systemic exposure (AUC and C max ) post-inhalation was shown to be proportional to the YUTREPIA doses administered (25 mcg \u2013 150 mcg). The treprostinil mean C max , mean AUC inf and median T max following a single inhaled target maintenance dose of 79.5 mcg YUTREPIA were 1.48 ng/mL, 1.04 hr.ng/mL and 0.13 hr, respectively. Distribution In vitro treprostinil is 91% bound to human plasma proteins over the 330-10,000 ng/mL concentration range. Metabolism and Excretion Of subcutaneously administered treprostinil, only 4% is excreted unchanged in urine. Treprostinil is substantially metabolized by the liver, primarily by CYP2C8. Metabolites are excreted in urine (79%) and feces (13%) over 10 days. Five apparently inactive metabolites were detected in the urine, each accounting for 10\u201115% of the dose administered. Four of the metabolites are products of oxidation of the 3-hydroxyloctyl side chain and one is a glucuroconjugated derivative (treprostinil glucuronide).

There was no evidence for carcinogenic potential associated with treprostinil inhalation in rats at systemic exposure levels up to 35 times following a single YUTREPIA dose of 79.5 mcg [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies did not demonstrate any mutagenic or clastogenic effects of treprostinil. Treprostinil sodium did not affect fertility or mating performance of male or female rats given continuous subcutaneous (sc) infusions at rates of up to 450 ng treprostinil/kg/min. In this study, males were dosed from 10 weeks prior to mating and through the 2-week mating period. Females were dosed from 2 weeks prior to mating until gestational day 6. Oral administration of treprostinil diolamine to Tg.rasH2 mice at 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 3, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg/day in females daily for 26 weeks did not significantly increase the incidence of tumors. Treprostinil diolamine was tested in vivo in a rat micronucleus assay and did not induce an increased incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In a 2-year rat study with treprostinil inhalation at target doses of 5.26, 10.6, and 34.1 mcg/kg/day, there were more deaths (11) in the mid- and high-dose treprostinil groups during the first 9 weeks of the study, compared to 1 in control groups. At the high-dose level, males showed a higher incidence of inflammation in teeth and preputial gland, and females showed high incidences of inflammation and urothelial hyperplasia in the urinary bladder.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (WHO Group 1) TRIUMPH I was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study of patients with PAH. The study population included 235 clinically stable patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group 1), nearly all with NYHA Class III (98%) symptoms who were receiving either bosentan (an endothelin receptor antagonist) or sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) for at least three months prior to study initiation. Concomitant therapy also could have included anticoagulants, other vasodilators (e.g., calcium channel blockers), diuretics, oxygen, and digitalis, but not a prostacyclin. These patients were administered either placebo or treprostinil inhalation solution in four daily treatment sessions with a target dose of 9 breaths (equivalent to 79.5 mcg YUTREPIA) per session over the course of the 12-week study. Patients were predominantly female (82%), had the origin of PAH as idiopathic/heritable (56%), secondary to connective tissue diseases (33%) or secondary to HIV or previous use of anorexigens (12%); bosentan was the concomitant oral medication in 70% of those enrolled, sildenafil in 30%. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was the change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) relative to baseline at 12 weeks. 6MWD was measured at peak exposure (between 10 and 60 minutes after dosing), and 3\u20115 hours after bosentan or 0.5-2 hours after sildenafil. Patients receiving treprostinil inhalation solution had a placebo-corrected median change from baseline in peak 6MWD of 20 meters at Week 12 (p<0.001). The distribution of these 6MWD changes from baseline at Week 12 were plotted across the range of observed values ( Figure 1 ). 6MWD measured at trough exposure (defined as measurement of 6MWD at least 4 hours after dosing) improved by 14 meters. There were no placebo-controlled 6MWD assessments made after 12 weeks. Figure 1. Distributions of 6MWD Changes from Baseline at Week 12 during Peak Plasma Concentration of Treprostinil Inhalation Solution The placebo-corrected median treatment effect on 6MWD was estimated (using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator) within various subpopulations defined by age quartile, gender, geographic region of the study site, disease etiology, baseline 6MWD quartile, and type of background therapy ( Figure 2 ). Figure 2. Placebo-Corrected Median Treatment Effect (Hodges-Lehmann estimate with 95% CI) on 6MWD Change from Baseline at Week 12 During Peak Plasma Concentration of Treprostinil Inhalation Solution for Various Subgroups Figure 1 Figure 2 14.2 Pulmonary Hypertension Associated with ILD (WHO Group 3) INCREASE was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study that enrolled 326 patients with PH-ILD. Enrolled study patients predominately had etiologies of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (45%) inclusive of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (25%), and WHO Group 3 connective tissue disease (22%). The mean baseline 6MWD was 260 meters. Patients in the INCREASE study were randomized (1:1) to either placebo or treprostinil inhalation solution in four daily treatment sessions with a target dose of 9 breaths (equivalent to 79.5 mcg YUTREPIA) per session and a maximum dose of 12 breaths (equivalent to 106 mcg YUTREPIA) per session over the course of the 16-week study. Approximately 75% of patients randomized to treprostinil inhalation solution titrated up to a dose of 9 breaths, 4 times daily or greater, with 48% of patients randomized to treprostinil inhalation solution reaching a dose of 12 breaths, 4 times daily during the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in 6MWD measured at peak exposure (between 10 and 60 minutes after dosing) from baseline to Week 16. Patients receiving treprostinil inhalation solution had a placebo-corrected median change from baseline in peak 6MWD of 21 meters at Week 16 (p=0.004) using Hodges-Lehmann estimate ( Figure 3 ). Figure 3: Hodges-Lehmann Estimate of Treatment Effect by Visit for 6MWD at Peak Exposure (PH-ILD) The treatment effect on 6MWD at Week 16 was consistent for various subgroups, including etiology of PH-ILD, disease severity, age, sex, baseline hemodynamics, and dose ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4: Forest Plot on Subgroup Analyses of Peak 6MWD (Meter) at Week 16 (PH-ILD) Time to clinical worsening in the INCREASE study was defined as the time of randomization until 1 of the following criteria were met: hospitalization due to a cardiopulmonary indication, decrease in 6MWD >15% from baseline directly related to PH-ILD at 2 consecutive visits and at least 24 hours apart, death (all causes), or lung transplantation. Treatment with treprostinil inhalation solution in patients with PH-ILD resulted in numerically fewer hospitalizations. The numbers of reported deaths were the same for both treatment groups ( Table 3 ). Overall, treatment with treprostinil inhalation solution demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the time to first clinical worsening event (log-rank test p=0.041; Figure 5 ), and a 39% overall reduction in the risk of a clinical worsening event (HR=0.61 [95% CI; 0.40, 0.92]; Figure 5 ).

Ensure all supplies are gathered and you are familiar with the use of the product prior to opening the card. STEP 1. Gather your supplies. a. Place your YUTREPIA carton on a clean, dry surface. b. Remove the inhaler and foil blister cards from the carton (See Figure B) . STEP 2. Select the capsule(s) for your dose. Use the Dosing Chart (See Figure C) to help you identify the capsule(s) needed for your prescribed dose. \u2022 If your prescribed dose is more than 106 mcg, you will need to inhale 2 capsules per the Dosing Chart (see Figure C) . \u2022 Only load and inhale 1 capsule at a time. \u2022 All capsules in a carton are the same strength. If your prescribed dose requires 2 capsules of different strengths, you will need to select your capsules from 2 separate cartons. IMPORTANT: For doses requiring 2 capsules, only use the capsule combinations presented in the Dosing Chart (See Figure C) . The order for inhaling 2 capsules does not matter, regardless of capsule strength. STEP 3. Check the inhaler and blister card(s). a. Look at the inhaler and blister card(s) to make sure they are not damaged (See Figure D) . Do not use the inhaler or capsules if they are damaged. b. Look at the expiration date on the blister cards to make sure it has not passed (See Figure E) . Do not use the capsules if the expiration date has passed. Loading YUTREPIA STEP 4. Open the inhaler. a. Pull the cover straight off the inhaler (See Figure F) . b. Rotate the mouthpiece in the direction of the arrow (counter-clockwise) to open the inhaler and expose the capsule chamber (See Figure G) . If the mouthpiece separates from the base of the inhaler, gently reattach the 2 pieces and continue to follow the instructions. STEP 5. Remove the capsule from the blister strip. a. Separate 1 blister strip by tearing at the pre-cut lines (See Figure H) . Do not remove a capsule from the blister strip until you are ready to deliver your dose. b. Peel the foil away from the blister strip, remove the capsule (See Figure I) . Do not swallow the capsule. Do not push the capsule through the foil. Do not remove the desiccant tab. Capsule must be used within 5 minutes of opening the blister card. STEP 6. Secure the capsule in the inhaler. a. Hold the inhaler in an upright position. b. Place the capsule in the capsule chamber in the base of the inhaler (See Figure J) . Only load 1 capsule. Do not place a capsule in the mouthpiece. Do not swallow capsules. STEP 7. Puncture the capsule. a. Put one finger on top of the capsule to hold it down (See Figure K) . b. While still holding down the capsule, firmly press both puncture buttons all the way in with your other hand (See Figure L). Then let go of (release) the puncture buttons. This will puncture the capsule. You only need to press the puncture buttons 1 time. c. Hold the base of the inhaler and rotate the mouthpiece to close it. Inhaling YUTREPIA STEP 8. Position the inhaler. a. Hold the inhaler upright and away from your mouth. (See Figure M) . Do not hold the inhaler by the puncture buttons. STEP 9. Breathe out (exhale). a. Breathe out fully and away from the inhaler (See Figure N) . Do not exhale into the mouthpiece. STEP 10. Breathe in deeply (inhale) a. Close your lips around the mouthpiece (See Figure O) . b. Tilt your head back slightly (See Figure O) . c. Take a comfortable deep breath in (inhale) until your lungs feel full (See Figure O) . As you inhale, you will hear or feel a whirring noise as the capsule spins and releases medicine. STEP 11. Hold breath, then breathe out (exhale). a. Take the inhaler out of your mouth and hold your breath for 5 seconds or as long as you comfortably can (See Figure P) . b. Then breathe out normally. IMPORTANT: If you cough when inhaling, repeat STEP 8 through11. STEP 12. Inhale again. a. To make sure the capsule is completely emptied of medicine, repeat STEP 8 through11 (See Figure Q) . Always inhale each capsule 2 times to make sure you get your full dose. Removing and disposing of the capsule STEP 13. Open the inhaler. a. Rotate the mouthpiece in the direction of the arrow (counter-clockwise) to open the inhaler and expose the capsule chamber (See Figure R) . b. Remove the used (empty) capsule and throw away (dispose of) into household trash (See Figure S) . c. See box below if you need to use more than 1 capsule to complete your prescribed dose. d. Continue to Step 14 if you have completed your prescribed dose. Closing and storing the inhaler STEP 14. Close the inhaler. a. Hold the base of the inhaler and rotate the mouthpiece to close it (See Figure T). b. Put the cover on the inhaler (See Figure U) . c. Store the inhaler in a clean, dry place at room temperature. Cleaning the inhaler (at end of each day) Clean the outside and inside of the inhaler after your last dose of the day. a. Wipe the mouthpiece with a dry paper towel, tissue, or clean dry cloth (See Figure V) . b. Use the cleaning brush provided to clean the capsule chamber in order to remove visible powder buildup (See Figure W) . NOTE: Throw away the brush after cleaning. Use only 1 brush each day.
