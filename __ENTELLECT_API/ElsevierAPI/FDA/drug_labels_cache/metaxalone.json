      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1.

Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with Metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome : Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants : The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal.

Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age.

Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that metaxalone tablets could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone tablets used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

Serotonin syndrome has been reported when metaxalone was used at doses higher than the recommended dose (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). When determining the LD 50 in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis, and finally respiratory failure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD 50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes. Treatment - Gastric lavage and supportive therapy.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )]. Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone Tablets with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone tablets-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone tablets use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg * \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation of Metaxalone Overdose Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone Tablets with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone tablets-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone tablets use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

      "Clinical Presentation of Metaxalone Overdose Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone Cmax and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Cmax2 AUC \u221e2 400 mg1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean Tmax of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean Tmax of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean Tmax under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t1/2) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, Tmax, and t1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) Cmax (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) Tmax (hrs) t1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)]. Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters * Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) \u2020 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Dose (mg) Cmax (ng/mL) Tmax (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u25cfh/mL) T1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400* 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800\u2020 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone Following an 800 mg Dose Under Fasted and Fed Conditions [Figure 1] Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CPY2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetics Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) Under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Cmax (ng/mL) 1816 3510 2719 2915 3168 3680 (43) (41) (46) (55) (43) (59) Tmax (h) 3.0 4.9 3.0 8.7 2.6 6.5 (39) (48) (40) (91) (30) (67) AUC0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 20683 19836 20482 23797 24340 (47) (41) (40) (37) (45) (48) AUC\u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 20833 20490 20815 24194 24704 (46) (41) (39) (37) (44) (47) Gender The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by Cmax (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone tablets with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, PHARMACOKINETICS and PRECAUTIONS, INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS). Information for Patients Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless in the judgement of the physician the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

When determining the LD50 in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis and finally respiratory failure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes. Treatment Gastric lavage and supportive therapy. Consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended."

Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2.

The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to any components of this product. Known tendency to drug induced, hemolytic, or other anemias. Significantly impaired renal or hepatic function."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with Metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome : Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants : The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

Serotonin syndrome has been reported when metaxalone was used at doses higher than the recommended dose (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). When determining the LD 50 in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis, and finally respiratory failure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD 50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes. Treatment - Gastric lavage and supportive therapy. Consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )]. Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone Tablets with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone tablets-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone tablets use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetics Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone tablets with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients sections). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with Metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome : Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants : The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation of Metaxalone Overdose Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetics Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone tablets with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients sections). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng \u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1 - Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under Fasted and Fed Conditions. Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1,816 (43) 3,510 (41) 2,719 (46) 2,915 (55) 3,168 (43) 3,680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14,531 (47) 20,683 (41) 19,836 (40) 20,482 (37) 23,797 (45) 24,340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15,045 (46) 20,833 (41) 20,490 (39) 20,815 (37) 24,194 (44) 24,704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to any components of this product. Known tendency to drug induced, hemolytic, or other anemias. Significantly impaired renal or hepatic function."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery: Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome: Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants: The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: \u2022 CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". \u2022 Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: \u2022 CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . \u2022 Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; \u2022 Hepatobiliary : jaundice; \u2022 Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). figure 1 Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients section). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and OVERDOSAGE). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS). Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1 - Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under Fasted and Fed Conditions. Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1,816 (43) 3,510 (41) 2,719 (46) 2,915 (55) 3,168 (43) 3,680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) 14,531 (47) 20,683 (41) 19,836 (40) 20,482 (37) 23,797 (45) 24,340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2219h/mL) 15,045 (46) 20,833 (41) 20,490 (39) 20,815 (37) 24,194 (44) 24,704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients section ). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."

      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to any components of this product. Known tendency to drug induced, hemolytic, or other anemias. Significantly impaired renal or hepatic function."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with Metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome : Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants : The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) Cmax (ng/mL) Tmax (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd(h) CL/F (L/h) 4001 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 8002 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Cmax(ng/mL) 1,816 (43) 3,510 (41) 2,719 (46) 2,915 (55) 3,168 (43) 3,680 (59) Tmax(h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC0-t(ng\u00b7h/mL) 14,531 (47) 20,683 (41) 19,836 (40) 20,482 (37) 23,797 (45) 24,340 (48) AUC\u221e(ng\u00b7h/mL) 15,045 (46) 20,833 (41) 20,490 (39) 20,815 (37) 24,194 (44) 24,704 (47) Gender The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by Cmax (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17,884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Fig. 1"

      "Warnings and Precautions Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: PHARMACOKINETICS and PRECAUTIONS: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS, and OVERDOSAGE). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS). Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )]. Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone Tablets with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone tablets-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone tablets use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal.

Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2.

The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure1.

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2.

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery: Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome: Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants: The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) Cmax (ng/mL) Tmax (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 4001 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 8002 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalonein the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1) .\u200b Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Cmax (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) Tmax (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by Cmax (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. FIG 1"

      "Warnings and Precautions Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS) and with Metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: PHARMACOKINETICS and PRECAUTIONS: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery: Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome: Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS, and OVERDOSAGE). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants: The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS). Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "Adverse Reactions The most frequent reactions to metaxalone include: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \u201cirritability\u201d; Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions are: Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus; Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS, and OVERDOSAGE)."

    "overdosage": [
      "Overdosage Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with antidepressants, and have been reported with this class of drug in combination with alcohol. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when metaxalone was used at doses higher than the recommended dose (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). When determining the LD50 in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis, and finally respiratory failure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes. Treatment - Gastric lavage and supportive therapy. Consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended."

      "Clinical Pharmacology Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) Cmax (ng/mL) Tmax (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 4001 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 8002 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC0-t, AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (Tmax) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Cmax (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) Tmax (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC\u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by Cmax (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Fig. 1"

Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: PHARMACOKINETICS and PRECAUTIONS: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that metaxalone tablets could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone tablets used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS, and OVERDOSAGE). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS). Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

    "overdosage": [
      "Overdosage Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with antidepressants, and have been reported with this class of drug in combination with alcohol. Serotonin syndrome has been reported when metaxalone was used at doses higher than the recommended dose (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). When determining the LD50 in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis, and finally respiratory failure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD50 could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes. Treatment - Gastric lavage and supportive therapy. Consultation with a regional poison control center is recommended."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see ) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see and ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that metaxalone tablets could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone tablets used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see , , and ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see ). Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng \u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1 - Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under Fasted and Fed Conditions. Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1,816 (43) 3,510 (41) 2,719 (46) 2,915 (55) 3,168 (43) 3,680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) 14,531 (47) 20,683 (41) 19,836 (40) 20,482 (37) 23,797 (45) 24,340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2219h/mL) 15,045 (46) 20,833 (41) 20,490 (39) 20,815 (37) 24,194 (44) 24,704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery: Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome: Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants: The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2.

The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone tablets with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients sections). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC\u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t\u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC\u221e) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetics Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC\u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone tablets with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients sections). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation of Metaxalone Overdose Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 1 \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% 1 - 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng \u2022h/mL) t 1/2 (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t, AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1 - Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under Fasted and Fed Conditions. Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro. Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1,816 (43) 3,510 (41) 2,719 (46) 2,915 (55) 3,168 (43) 3,680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) 14,531 (47) 20,683 (41) 19,836 (40) 20,482 (37) 23,797 (45) 24,340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2219h/mL) 15,045 (46) 20,833 (41) 20,490 (39) 20,815 (37) 24,194 (44) 24,704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "Mechanism of Action: The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man."

      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery: Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome: Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions, and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants: The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs: Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or post-marketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ]. Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg * \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see U se in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg * \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see U se in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] . Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The recommended metaxalone dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone or 400 mg of metaxalone (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) [the 400 mg strength of metaxalone is not currently marketed by Lannett Company, Inc.]. Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2022h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2022h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% * 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal.

Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC.

Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal.

Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2.

The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) and with Metaxalone as a single agent taken at doses higher than the recommended dose (see OVERDOSAGE ). Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome : Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants : The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight.

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. Figure 1"

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome : Inform patients that Metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants : The sedative effects of Metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs : Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetics Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. metaxalone-fig1"

      "Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1\u00d7400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2\u00d7400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18-50 years (mean age = 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). Figure 1. Mean (SD) Concentrations of Metaxalone following an 800 mg Dose under Fasted and Fed Conditions Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetics Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u2022h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2022h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2022h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment. metaxalone-fig1"

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients section). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system (CNS) depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7,479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1,816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15,044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). 1 Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1,816 (43) 3,510 (41) 2,719 (46) 2,915 (55) 3,168 (43) 3,680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14,531 (47) 20,683 (41) 19,836 (40) 20,482 (37) 23,797 (45) 24,340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15,045 (46) 20,833 (41) 20,490 (39) 20,815 (37) 24,194 (44) 24,704 (47) Gender The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2,115 ng/mL versus 1,335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17,884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10,328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days, but may occur later than that. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Risks from Concomitant Use with Alcohol or other CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions )."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). Information for Patients Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that metaxalone could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from administration of doses higher than the recommended dose or from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take, serotonergic medications (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , and OVERDOSAGE ). Drug Interactions CNS Depressants The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS ). Serotonergic Drugs Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see WARNINGS ). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] .

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxolone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC.

Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal.

Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )]. Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone Tablets with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone tablets-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone tablets use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of metaxalone tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age or younger have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of metaxalone tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The recommended metaxalone tablets dosage in patients 65 years of age and older is the same as in younger adult patients. Metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) were higher in patients 65 years of age and older in the fasted state; however, a clinically significant difference was not observed when metaxalone was administered in the fed state [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes expensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Metaxalone tablets should be used with caution and additional follow-up should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation of Metaxalone Overdose Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )]. Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 5 hours) of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 \u2013 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg* \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% *0.5 times the approved recommended dose. Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

(2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u2219h/mL versus 10328 ng\u2219h/mL) following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted conditions. The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone in humans has not been established, but may be due to general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate or the nerve fiber. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of metaxalone have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers after single dose administration of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions at doses ranging from 400 mg to 800 mg. Absorption Peak plasma concentrations of metaxalone occur approximately 3 hours after a 400 mg oral dose under fasted conditions. Thereafter, metaxalone concentrations decline log-linearly with a terminal half-life of 9.0 \u00b1 4.8 hours. Doubling the dose of metaxalone from 400 mg to 800 mg results in a roughly proportional increase in metaxalone exposure as indicated by peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC). Dose proportionality at doses above 800 mg has not been studied. The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Mean (%CV) Metaxalone Pharmacokinetic Parameters Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) T max (h) AUC \u221e (ng\u2022h/mL) t \u00bd (h) CL/F (L/h) 400 1 983 (53) 3.3 (35) 7479 (51) 9.0 (53) 68 (50) 800 2 1816 (43) 3.0 (39) 15044 (46) 8.0 (58) 66 (51) 1 Subjects received 1x400 mg tablet under fasted conditions (N=42) 2 Subjects received 2x400 mg tablets under fasted conditions (N=59) Food Effects A randomized, two-way, crossover study was conducted in 42 healthy volunteers (31 males, 11 females) administered one 400 mg metaxalone tablet under fasted conditions and following a standard high-fat breakfast. Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 48 years (mean age = 23.5 \u00b1 5.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 177.5% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 123.5% and 115.4%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.3 h versus 3.3 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (2.4 h versus 9.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted. In a second food effect study of similar design, two 400 mg metaxalone tablets (800 mg) were administered to healthy volunteers (N=59, 37 males, 22 females), ranging in age from 18 to 50 years (mean age = 25.6\u00b1 8.7 years). Compared to fasted conditions, the presence of a high fat meal at the time of drug administration increased C max by 193.6% and increased AUC (AUC 0-t , AUC \u221e ) by 146.4% and 142.2%, respectively. Time-to-peak concentration (T max ) was also delayed (4.9 h versus 3.0 h) and terminal half-life was decreased (4.2 h versus 8.0 h) under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions. Similar food effect results were observed in the above study when one metaxalone 800 mg tablet was administered in place of two metaxalone 400 mg tablets. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal (Figure 1). figure 1 Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Although plasma protein binding and absolute bioavailability of metaxalone are not known, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F ~ 800 L) and lipophilicity (log P = 2.42) of metaxalone suggest that the drug is extensively distributed in the tissues. Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Hepatic Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in the metabolism of metaxalone. Specifically, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 appear to metabolize metaxalone. Metaxalone does not significantly inhibit major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not significantly induce major CYP enzymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 in vitro . Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following single administration of two 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted and fed conditions. The results were analyzed separately, as well as in combination with the results from three other studies. Using the combined data, the results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone are significantly more affected by age under fasted conditions than under fed conditions, with bioavailability under fasted conditions increasing with age. The bioavailability of metaxalone under fasted and fed conditions in three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Mean (%CV) Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single Administration of Two 400 mg Metaxalone Tablets (800 mg) under Fasted and Fed Conditions Younger Volunteers Older Volunteers Age (years) 25.6 \u00b1 8.7 39.3 \u00b1 10.8 71.5 \u00b1 5.0 N 59 21 23 Food Fasted Fed Fasted Fed Fasted Fed C max (ng/mL) 1816 (43) 3510 (41) 2719 (46) 2915 (55) 3168 (43) 3680 (59) T max (h) 3.0 (39) 4.9 (48) 3.0 (40) 8.7 (91) 2.6 (30) 6.5 (67) AUC 0-t (ng\u00b7h/mL) 14531 (47) 20683 (41) 19836 (40) 20482 (37) 23797 (45) 24340 (48) AUC \u221e (ng\u00b7h/mL) 15045 (46) 20833 (41) 20490 (39) 20815 (37) 24194 (44) 24704 (47) Gender: The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone was assessed in an open label study, in which 48 healthy adult volunteers (24 males, 24 females) were administered two metaxalone 400 mg tablets (800 mg) under fasted conditions. The bioavailability of metaxalone was significantly higher in females compared to males as evidenced by C max (2115 ng/mL versus 1335 ng/mL) and AUC \u221e (17884 ng\u00b7h/mL versus 10328 ng\u00b7h/mL). The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females, but not significantly different when adjusted for body weight. Similar findings were also seen when the previously described combined dataset was used in the analysis. Hepatic/Renal Insufficiency: The impact of hepatic and renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone has not been determined. In the absence of such information, metaxalone should be used with caution in patients with hepatic and/or renal impairment."

      "PRECAUTIONS Metaxalone should be administered with great care to patients with pre-existing liver damage. Serial liver function studies should be performed in these patients. False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings. Taking metaxalone with food may enhance general CNS depression; elderly patients may be especially susceptible to this CNS effect. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients section). Information for Patients Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants. Drug Interactions The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Therefore, caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of metaxalone has not been determined. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to metaxalone. Post marketing experience has not revealed evidence of fetal injury, but such experience cannot exclude the possibility of infrequent or subtle damage to the human fetus. Safe use of metaxalone has not been established with regard to possible adverse effects upon fetal development. Therefore, metaxalone tablets should not be used in women who are or may become pregnant and particularly during early pregnancy unless, in the judgement of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is secreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is on a drug since many drugs are excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children 12 years of age and below have not been established."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use with another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, and may enhance the effects of other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use with another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) Risk with Inappropriate Switching to Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg Inappropriate switching on a mg-to-mg basis from SKELAXIN (metaxalone) tablets, 800 mg to Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg to achieve the same total daily metaxalone dosage may result in a clinically significant increase in metaxalone exposure which may increase the risk of metaxalone-associated adverse reactions including CNS depression. Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg and SKELAXIN (metaxalone) tablets, 800 mg are not mutually substitutable on a mg-to-mg basis ( 5.3 , 12.3 ). 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg and another serotonergic drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg if serotonin syndrome is suspected or occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Follow patients treated with Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. 5.3 Risk with Inappropriate Switching to Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg Inappropriate switching on a mg-to-mg basis from SKELAXIN (metaxalone) tablets, 800 mg to Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg to achieve the same total daily metaxalone dosage may result in a clinically significant increase in metaxalone exposure which may increase the risk of metaxalone-associated adverse reactions including CNS depression. For example, it is inappropriate to switch from four SKELAXIN 800 mg tablets (3,200 mg) per day to five tablets of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg (3,200 mg) per day [1.25 times the maximum recommended daily dosage of 2,560 mg] [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Metaxalone Tablets 640 mg and SKELAXIN (metaxalone) tablets, 800 mg are not mutually substitutable on a mg-to-mg basis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . It is generally inappropriate to switch between Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg and SKELAXIN 800 mg to mediate metaxalone-associated adverse reactions. For recommendations on how to switch from SKELAXIN (metaxalone) tablets, 800 mg, to Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg, see Dosage and Administration (2) ."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \u201cirritability\u201d Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: Allergic : anaphylaxis have been reported with metaxalone. CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.2) , and Overdosage (10) ]. Hematologic : leucopenia; hemolytic anemia. Hepatobiliary : jaundice. Immune System : hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. The most common adverse reactions to Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \u201cirritability\u201d, nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg and another serotonergic drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 Depressants If concomitant use of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict's tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment : Consider additional monitoring in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. ( 4 , 8.6 ) Renal impairment : Consider additional monitoring in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( 4 , 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed evidence of impaired fertility or harm to fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metaxalone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metaxalone or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg are indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg have not been evaluated. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 8.6 Hepatic Impairment Metaxalone Tablets. 640 mg are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment . Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg should be used with caution and additional monitoring should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Renal Impairment Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment . Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg should be used with caution and additional monitoring should be considered in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. The effect of renal impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown; however, metaxalone undergoes renal excretion as unidentified metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentations of Metaxalone Overdose Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose may occur with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Treatment of Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and, manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metaxalone as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions has not been established, but may be due to general CNS depression. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In a relative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers, the C max (peak plasma concentration) and AUC (extent of absorption) values of metaxalone from Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg were found to be similar to those from SKELAXIN 800 mg tablets. After a single dose of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg, under fasted conditions, mean C max and AUC values were 2 mcg/mL and 16 mcg*h/mL, respectively. The time-to-peak plasma concentration (T max ) occurred at 3.5 hours (range 1.5-12 hours). The plasma half-life in adult healthy subjects was approximately 5 hours after administration of Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg.

Elimination For Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg, the metaxalone plasma half-life was approximately 5 hours. Metabolism: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver. CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are involved in metaxalone metabolism. Excretion: Metaxalone is excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations For Metaxalone Tablets, 640 mg, the effect of age, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone is unknown. Males and Females: The metaxalone Cmax increased by 36% and AUC inf by 31%, in females compared to males following administration of 640 mg of Metaxalone Tablets. These data were not adjusted for other factors (e.g., weight, renal function). The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7) ] and with the use of Metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Overdosage (10) ] . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone tablets may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone tablets use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone tablets and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Follow metaxalone tablets-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone tablets were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS : drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive : nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS : cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone tablets as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Overdosage (10) ] . Hematologic : leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary : jaundice; Immune System : anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Serotonergic Drugs If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another serotoneric drug is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage modification. Discontinue metaxalone tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected or if it occurs. Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of metaxalone tablets (within the recommended dosage range) with other serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). 7.2 CNS Depressants If concomitant use of metaxalone tablets and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Due to the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of metaxalone tablets with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.3 Interaction of Metaxalone with Benedict\u2019s Tests False-positive Benedict\u2019s tests, due to an unknown reducing substance, have been noted in metaxalone-treated patients. A glucose-specific test will differentiate findings."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Use : Metaxalone tablets-treated geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression. ( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on metaxalone use in pregnant patients to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes despite decades of metaxalone use. Reproduction studies in rats have not revealed effects on the fetus due to metaxalone. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to evaluate the presence of metaxalone or its metabolite in either human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation of Metaxalone Overdose Deaths by deliberate or accidental overdose have occurred with metaxalone, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol). CNS manifestations may include CNS depression, agitation, hallucinations, delusions, seizures, respiratory depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects may include tachycardia and hypertension; hypotension has also been reported. Serotonin syndrome, leading to muscle rigidity, tremor, and hyperthermia, has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Treatment of Metaxalone Overdose The standard of treatment is supportive care. Monitor for CNS and respiratory depression and manage airway with oxygen as needed. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures (including emesis) should generally be avoided because aspiration may result from CNS depression and seizures. Extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis have no proven clinical benefit. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Metaxalone\u2019s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle, the motor end plate, or the nerve fiber. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure-response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of metaxalone not been fully characterized. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Metaxalone pharmacokinetics were evaluated in two groups of healthy volunteers that received a single oral dose of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets or 400 mg of metaxalone tablets (0.5 times the approved recommended dose). Metaxalone pharmacokinetic parameters are presented below as mean (% CV) unless otherwise specified. Observed metaxalone peak plasma concentrations (C max ) and area under the curve (AUC) are shown in Table 1. Doubling the dose of metaxalone tablets from 400 mg (0.5 times the approved recommended dose) to 800 mg resulted in a proportional increase in metaxalone C max and AUC. Table 1: Metaxalone Exposure after a Single-Dose of Metaxalone Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Dose Dose C max 2 AUC \u221e 2 400 mg 1 983 (53) ng/mL 7,479 (51) ng\u2219h/mL 800 mg 1,816 (43) ng/mL 15,044 (46) ng\u2219h/mL 1 0.5 times the approved recommended dose 2 Mean (% CV) Absorption The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone is not known. Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations occurred at a mean T max of 3.3 hours (1.5 hours to 5 hours) of metaxalone under fasted conditions. The single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of metaxalone in two groups of healthy volunteers who received 400 mg or 800 mg of metaxalone tablets are shown in Table 1. Effect of Food: Peak plasma metaxalone concentrations were noted at a mean T max of 4.3 hours (1.5 hours to 12 hours) under fed conditions. The mean T max under fasting and fed conditions was 3.3 hours and 4.3 hours, respectively. Metaxalone exposure was increased and the half-life (t 1/2 ) was decreased following metaxalone tablets administration with a high fat meal as shown in Table 2. The increase in metaxalone exposure coinciding with a reduction in half-life may be attributed to more complete absorption of metaxalone in the presence of a high fat meal. Table 2: Relative Changes in Metaxalone Exposure, T max , and t 1/2 Following Metaxalone Tablets Administration with a High Fat Meal Compared to Fasting Dose (mg) C max (ng/mL) AUC 0-t (ng\u2219h/mL) AUC 0-INF (ng\u2219h/mL) T max (hrs) t 1/2 (hrs) 400 mg 0.5 times the approved recommended dose. \u2191 78% \u2191 24% \u2191 15% \u2191 30% \u2193 73% 800 mg \u2191 94% \u2191 46% \u2191 42% \u2191 63% \u2193 48% Distribution Metaxalone apparent volume of distribution is approximately 800 Liters; however, plasma protein binding is unknown. Elimination Metaxalone mean \u00b1 SD terminal t 1/2 is 9 \u00b1 4.8 hours and apparent clearance is approximately 67 \u00b1 34 L/h under fasted conditions. Metabolism: Metaxalone is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Excretion: Metaxalone is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine as unidentified metabolites. Specific Populations The effect of renal impairment and hepatic impairment on metaxalone pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ] . Geriatric Patients: The effects of age on the pharmacokinetics of metaxalone were determined following administration of 800 mg of metaxalone tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Age had a significantly greater effect on metaxalone pharmacokinetics under fasted conditions than under fed conditions. Bioavailability under fasted conditions increased with age. Metaxalone bioavailability under fasted and fed conditions in the three groups of healthy volunteers of varying age is shown in Table 3.

The mean half-life was 11.1 hours in females and 7.6 hours in males. The apparent volume of distribution of metaxalone was approximately 22% higher in males than in females. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies: Metaxalone does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4. Metaxalone does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4."
